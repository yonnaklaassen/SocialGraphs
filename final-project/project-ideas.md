# Project Ideas

## 1. Spotify artists and lyrics

Nodes are artists, edges are collaborations. Nodes have a property with the lyrics of their songs. We can do NLP stuff and see how similar the lyrics of two artists are. We can also see how the lyrics of an artist change over time.

## 2. Music artists and movies

Nodes are artists and movies, edges are collaborations. We can see which artists have been in which movies, and which movies have had which artists. We can also see how the genres of the movies and the artists are related.

## 3. Courses at DTU

based on data from https://github.com/JonatanRasmussen/dtu-course-browser/tree/main/website/static/csv_files, we can analyze courses at DTU. Multiple ideas here, such as:

- Nodes are courses, edges are prerequisites. We can see which courses are prerequisites for which other courses.
- Nodes are courses, edges are teachers. We can see which teachers teach which courses.

Then we can analyze the data in various ways, such as:
- Is it possible to generate communities of courses?
