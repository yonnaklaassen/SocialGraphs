# Project Ideas

## 1. Spotify artists and lyrics

Nodes are artists, edges are collaborations. Nodes have a property with the lyrics of their songs. We can do NLP stuff and see how similar the lyrics of two artists are. We can also see how the lyrics of an artist change over time.

## 2. Music artists and movies

Nodes are artists and movies, edges are collaborations. We can see which artists have been in which movies, and which movies have had which artists. We can also see how the genres of the movies and the artists are related.
