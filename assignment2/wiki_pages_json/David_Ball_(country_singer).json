Active since 1988, he has recorded a total of seven studio albums on several labels, including his [[platinum album|platinum]] certified debut ''[[Thinkin' Problem]]''. Fourteen of Ball's singles have entered the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts. His highest-peaking chart entries are 1994's \"[[Thinkin' Problem (song)|Thinkin' Problem]]\" and 2001's \"[[Riding With Private Malone]]\", both of which peaked at No.&nbsp;2.\n\n==Biography==\nDavid Ball was born into a large musical family headed by his father, William \"Billy\" Ball, a Baptist minister, and his mother, Bessie Ball, a pianist. Later, he moved with his family to [[Spartanburg, South Carolina]], where his father was pastor of Fernwood Baptist church. He eventually learned to play guitar after persuading his parents to buy him one. Having written his first song in seventh grade, he played it in a school talent show with a band he had formed, the Strangers. Afterwards, he played [[upright bass]] in various local youth groups and also the school orchestra. Together with friends, he took part in various [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] and [[country music|country]] festivals in the Carolinas.\n\nBy the time Ball had left high school, he had a gig playing bass in [[Uncle Walt's Band]], a trio headed by [[Walter Hyatt]], who relocated to [[Austin, Texas]], in the mid-1970s, in an attempt to make a mainstream breakthrough.\n\nBall subsequently focused on a solo career, moving to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], where he was signed to a publishing contract. Three singles for [[RCA Records Nashville|RCA Nashville]] in the late 1980s failed to provide a solo breakthrough, however, and a projected album was shelved and was not released until 1994. The experience did at least serve to introduce him to producer [[Blake Chancey]], son of country producer [[Ron Chancey]]. In the spring of 1993, Chancey called [[Warner Bros. Records]] director Doug Grau on Ball's behalf.\n\nA new recording contract followed. ''Thinkin' Problem'', his debut album, was released on Warner Bros. Its title track served as the lead-off single, reaching No.&nbsp;2 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country music charts and No.&nbsp;40 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The album, which received a platinum certification in the U.S., also produced the singles \"[[When the Thought of You Catches Up with Me]]\", \"Look What Followed Me Home\", \"What Do You Want with His Love\", and \"Honky Tonk Healin'\", although the latter two singles failed to make Top 40 on the country charts.\n\nBall recorded two more albums for the label – ''Starlite Lounge'' and ''Play'' – without much chart success. However, \"Riding with Private Malone\", from the 2001 album ''Amigo'' on the Dualtone label, reached a peak of No.&nbsp;2 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks charts (now Hot Country Songs) chart, and No.&nbsp;36 on the Billboard Hot 100. This album failed to produce any other hits, however, and Ball exited Dualtone in 2002. ''Freewheeler'' followed in 2004, ''Heartaches by the Number'' in 2007 and ''Sparkle City'' in 2010.\n\nIn the 1995 album \"Come Together: America Salutes The Beatles\" David Ball's version of \"I'll Follow The Sun\" starts off the collection of Beatles songs by other artists.\n\nBall's \"Thinkin' Problem\" was parodied by Cledus T. Judd. Ball then appears in Judd's Shania Twain parody \"If Shania Was Mine\", standing behind the cameras and saying, \"At least he's not picking on me this time.\"\n\n== Discography ==\n\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:14em;\"| Title\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:20em;\"| Album details\n! colspan=\"4\"| Peak chart positions\n! rowspan=\"2\"| [[Music recording sales certification|Certifications]]<br /><small>([[List of music recording sales certifications|sales thresholds]])</small>\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n! width=\"45\"| [[Top Country Albums|US Country]]<br /><ref name=\"Country Albums\">{{cite magazine|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=david ball|chart=Country Albums C}}|title=David Ball Album & Song Chart History – Country Albums|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|access-date=December 11, 2010}}</ref>\n! width=\"45\"| [[Billboard 200|US]]<br /><ref name=\"Billboard 200\">{{cite magazine|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=david ball|chart=Billboard 200}}|title=David Ball Album & Song Chart History – Billboard 200|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|access-date=December 11, 2010}}</ref>\n! width=\"45\"| [[RPM (magazine)|CAN Country]]<br /><ref>Peak chart positions for albums charting on the Canadian Country Albums/CDs Chart:\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-110.01-e.php?PHPSESSID=vkta24okkdvphv3qncpnd6qmn5&q1=david+ball&q2=Country+Albums%2FCDs&interval=20|title=Results – RPM – Library and Archives Canada – Country Albums/CDs|work=[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]|access-date=December 12, 2010}}</ref>\n! width=\"45\"| [[RPM (magazine)|CAN]]<br /><ref>Peak chart positions for albums charting on the Canadian Top Albums/CDs Chart:\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-110.01-e.php?PHPSESSID=54hrc9nf644v2338jbeko2pdu4&q1=david+ball&q2=Top+Albums%2FCDs&interval=20|title=Results – RPM – Library and Archives Canada – Top Albums/CDs|work=[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]|access-date=December 12, 2010}}</ref>\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[David Ball (album)|David Ball]]''<ref>The album was recorded in 1989 and was originally titled \"Steppin' Out\", but it was shelved and wasn't released until 1994 and was retitled as \"David Ball\"</ref>\n| \n* Release date: November 22, 1989\n* Label: [[RCA Records Nashville|RCA Nashville]]\n| —\n| —\n| —\n| —\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[Thinkin' Problem]]''\n| \n* Release date: June 14, 1994\n* Label: [[Warner Bros.
