Recognized as \"carrying on the tradition of improvisational, genre-spanning music laid forth by the [[Grateful Dead]],\" Railroad Earth is known for lyrical songwriting and extensive live improvisation.<ref name=NPR/> The band takes its name from the [[Jack Kerouac]] [[prose poem]] \"October in the Railroad Earth\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2012/oct/19/jack-kerouac-october|title=Jack Kerouac's Octoberish magic|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=19 October 2012|access-date=7 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://sensitiveskinmagazine.com/october-in-the-railroad-earth-jack-kerouac/|title=October in the Railroad Earth [Full Text and Audio]|date=12 March 2016|publisher=Sensitive Skin|access-date=7 December 2018}}</ref> The band also has a song of the same name.\n\n==History==\n{{more citations needed|date=October 2018}}\nThe band was originally formed in 2001, and was composed of vocalist/guitarist/songwriter Todd Sheaffer, violinist/vocalist Tim Carbone, mandolinist John Skehan, multi-instrumentalist Andy Goessling, drummer/vocalist Carey Harmon, and bassist Dave Von Dollen. Though each member was aware of one another, it was only Todd, Tim, and Andy who had played together. Tim, had joined Todd's band From Good Homes on stage, in addition Tim and Andy having a 20-year friendship through their former bands, The Blue Sparks From Hell, and [[New Jersey]] rock outfit [[Kings in Disguise]]. When rehearsals of original music, mostly written by Sheaffer, began occurring, the band soon realized that something musically unique was happening. After three weeks of rehearsing, they went into a local recording studio to track a five-song demo. Recorded live with no overdubs except backing vocals, this untitled demo set Railroad Earth's career in motion.  Within a week, they landed a slot at [[Telluride Bluegrass Festival]], an appearance that was only the new band's tenth as Railroad Earth. The previous nine gigs had been little more than warm-ups at small North Jersey bars and Elks lodges and a couple of support slots for regional bands.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.pollstar.com/blogs/hotstar/archive_/2009/06/19/hotstar22833.aspx |title=Railroad Earth &#124; Pollstar - the Concert Hotwire |access-date=2009-10-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090810131640/http://www.pollstar.com/blogs/hotstar/archive_/2009/06/19/hotstar22833.aspx |archive-date=2009-08-10 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Realizing immediately how strong the initial five-song demo was, the band decided to return to the same studio to cut another five tracks to complete an album for release in time to debut at the [[Telluride Bluegrass Festival]]. In early April 2001, the band tracked another five songs, and ''[[The Black Bear Sessions]]'' was completed. It was released to the public in June 2001, just one week before their appearance at Telluride. That album contains what are still some of the most popular songs in Railroad Earth's repertoire, including \"Seven Story Mountain,\" \"Head\" and, of course, \"Railroad Earth.\"\n\nThe band was approached by [[Sugar Hill Records (bluegrass)|Sugar Hill Records]] after seeing their performance at Telluride. Right after their show, Railroad Earth was offered a record deal on the spot.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nIn June 2002, Railroad Earth released its follow-up album on Sugar Hill titled ''[[Bird in a House]]'', featuring such enduring songs as \"Like A Buddha,\" \"Mighty River,\" and the album's title track. Throughout that year Railroad Earth's touring schedule increased dramatically and their growing fanbase began to emerge as something tangible to promoters, radio stations and other media. They were garnering raves for their unique sound and exciting live shows and had become a staple act on the line-up of any roots, folk or [[jam-band]] festival. Their fans, who were now calling themselves \"Hobos,\" began to grow quickly in number, and the venues were getting larger along with them.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nIn late March 2003, Dave Von Dollen was replaced by Atlanta-based bassist Johnny Grubb. The following year, the band released its third studio effort, ''[[The Good Life (Railroad Earth album)|The Good Life]]'', featuring \"Storms\", \"Mourning Flies\" and \"Goat\".  The band continued to tour throughout the country, and its first live album, ''[[Elko (album)|Elko]]'', was issued in late January 2006. They performed at the [[Austin City Limits Music Festival]] on September 15, 2007.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://livemusicblog.com/news/2007-austin-city-limits-music-festival-lineup/|title = 2007 Austin City Limits Music Festival Lineup - LIVE music blog|newspaper = Live Music Blog|date = 10 May 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe band's fourth studio album, titled ''Amen Corner'', was released on June 10, 2008. The album features songs such as \"Been Down This Road,\" \"Hard Livin',\" \"[[The Forecast]],\" and \"[[Lovin' You]].\"\n[[File:Railroad Earth Richmond Va 05-21-2010-1.jpg|Railroad Earth playing Friday Cheers on May 21, 2010 in Richmond, Virginia|thumb|250px]]\n\nOn November 11, 2009, Grubb announced his departure from the band after Railroad Earth's New Year's Eve run of shows in [[Portland, Oregon]].

It featured the 21-minute-long \"suite\" of \"All That's Dead May Live Again\" and \"Face With a Hole\" both written by Todd Sheaffer, and featured instrumental movements written by John Skehan<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.relix.com/reviews/detail/railroad_earth_last_of_the_outlaws|title=Railroad Earth: Last of the Outlaws - Relix Media|date=10 January 2014|website=Relix.com|access-date=14 October 2018}}</ref> In the tour that followed Railroad Earth headlined [[Red Rocks]] for the second time, selling out, and with the help of the Mile High Horns (arranged by Jay Rattman). The result can be seen on the DVD ''Live at Red Rocks''.\n\nRailroad Earth backed [[Warren Haynes]] on February 3, 2015 for a taping of the PBS series ''Front and Center'' for airing in May 2015.
