The group consists of [[Gary LeVox]] (lead vocals), [[Jay DeMarcus]] (bass guitar, background vocals), and [[Joe Don Rooney]] (lead guitar, background vocals). DeMarcus is LeVox's second cousin, a brother-in-law of country music singer [[James Otto]], and was previously a member of the [[contemporary Christian music]] duo [[East to West]]. LeVox and DeMarcus are both natives of [[Columbus, Ohio]].\n\nFrom 2000 to 2010, the band recorded for [[Disney Music Group]]'s former [[Lyric Street Records]] division. While on that label, it released six studio albums, all of which were [[RIAA certification|certified]] platinum or higher by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). The group's self-titled debut ''[[Rascal Flatts (album)|Rascal Flatts]]'' was released in 2000, and ''[[Melt (Rascal Flatts album)|Melt]]'' (2002), garnered their first number-one single, \"[[These Days (Rascal Flatts song)|These Days]]\". ''[[Feels Like Today]]'' (2004), ''[[Me and My Gang]]'' (2006), ''[[Still Feels Good]]'' (2007), and ''[[Unstoppable (Rascal Flatts album)|Unstoppable]]'' (2009) all topped the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] upon release. After Lyric Street closed in 2010, they moved to [[Big Machine Records]]. During their tenure with that label, they recorded five more studio albums: ''[[Nothing Like This (album)|Nothing Like This]]'' (2010), ''[[Changed (album)|Changed]]'' (2012), ''[[Rewind (Rascal Flatts album)|Rewind]]'' (2014), a Christmas album entitled ''[[The Greatest Gift of All]]'' (2016), and ''[[Back to Us]]'' (2017).\n\nRascal Flatts has released more than forty singles, sixteen of which reached number one on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]], [[Country Airplay]], and/or [[Canada Country]] charts. Their longest-running number-one, a cover of [[Marcus Hummon]]'s \"[[Bless the Broken Road#Rascal Flatts version|Bless the Broken Road]]\", spent five weeks at number one on Hot Country Songs in 2005. Through 2006 and 2007, \"[[What Hurts the Most#Rascal Flatts version|What Hurts the Most]]\" was number one on both the Hot Country Songs and [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]] charts, and garnered their highest peak on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] at number six. The band also had commercial success with a cover of [[Tom Cochrane]]'s \"[[Life Is a Highway#Rascal Flatts version|Life Is a Highway]]\", which they recorded for the [[Cars (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] of the [[Pixar]] animated film ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]'' (2006). Rascal Flatts' music is defined by [[country pop]] influences, as well as their distinct [[Vocal harmony|vocal harmonies]]. In addition to their own music, DeMarcus has produced albums for [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]], [[Jennette McCurdy]], and [[Brooks & Dunn]] member [[Kix Brooks]].\n\nThe band was named [[Country Music Association Award for Vocal Group of the Year|Vocal Group of the Year]] by the [[Country Music Association]] every year from 2003 to 2008, Top Vocal Group by the [[Academy of Country Music]] from 2003 to 2009 and won the [[American Music Award for Artist of the Year]] in 2006. They were inducted into the [[Grand Ole Opry]] in 2011 and received a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] in 2012. \"Bless the Broken Road\" was also named [[Grammy Award for Best Country Song|Best Country Song]] at the [[48th Annual Grammy Awards]].\n\nOn January 7, 2020, Rascal Flatts announced that they would be disbanding following a farewell tour after twenty years together. However, this farewell tour was canceled due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]]; the group's disbandment was officially confirmed in October 2021. The group announced a reunion tour on October 1, 2024, to commence in 2025.\n\n== Origins ==\n{{quote box|quote=We're not just business partners, we are good friends.
