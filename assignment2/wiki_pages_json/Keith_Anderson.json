Before signing to a record deal, Anderson was one of several co-writers on \"Beer Run (B Double E Double R-U-N)\", a duet by [[Garth Brooks]] and [[George Jones]], released in late 2001. Anderson was signed as a recording artist to [[Arista Nashville]] in 2004. His debut single \"[[Pickin' Wildflowers]]\" was released that year, as the lead-off track from his debut album ''[[Three Chord Country and American Rock & Roll]]''. Counting \"Pickin' Wildflowers\", the album produced a total of four hit singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts, and was certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].\n\nIn addition to his own material, Anderson co-wrote [[Big & Rich]]'s single \"[[Lost in This Moment]]\", a Number One hit on the country music charts in mid-2007. Anderson switched to the [[Columbia Records|Columbia]] label in 2007, and his second album, ''[[C'mon! (Keith Anderson album)|C'mon!]]'', was released on August 5, 2008. The second single from the album, \"[[I Still Miss You]]\", became his first Top 5 country hit.\n\nHis latest release is a six-song EP album titled ''I'll Bring the Music''; it was released May 12, 2015.\n\n== Early life ==\nWhile growing up in Miami, Oklahoma, he played sports during [[Middle School|middle]] and high school, and began his music career by playing in a band at church.<ref name=\"bio\">{{cite web|url=http://www.keithanderson.com/bio/index.php|title=Biography|publisher=Keith Anderson|access-date=September 19, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701050947/http://www.keithanderson.com/bio/index.php|archive-date=July 1, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> After graduating from high school, he attended [[Oklahoma State University]],<ref name=\"bio\" /> where he was a member of [[Delta Tau Delta]] fraternity.
