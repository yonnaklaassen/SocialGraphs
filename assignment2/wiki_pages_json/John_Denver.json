With a military father, Denver's family moved often, and he found difficulty gaining friends and assimilating with children of his own age.

He was content in Tucson, but his father was transferred to [[Maxwell Air Force Base]] in [[Montgomery, Alabama]]. The family later moved to [[Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth|Carswell Air Force Base]] in [[Fort Worth, Texas]], where Denver graduated from [[Arlington Heights High School]]. Denver was distressed with life in Fort Worth, and in his third year of high school, he drove his father's car to California to visit family friends and begin his music career. His father flew to California in a friend's jet to retrieve him, and Denver reluctantly returned to complete his schooling.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_g1epc/is_bio/ai_2419200301 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120708100625/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_g1epc/is_bio/ai_2419200301 |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 8, 2012 |title=John Denver |via=Find Articles |access-date=May 9, 2011 |year=2002}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===Early career===\nAt age 11, Denver received an acoustic guitar from his grandmother.<ref name=\"bio\" /> He learned to play well enough to perform at local clubs by the time he was in college.

Two years earlier, he had made a self-produced demo recording of some of the songs he played at his concerts. It included a song Denver had written called \"Babe, I Hate to Go\", later renamed \"[[Leaving on a Jet Plane]]\".

When he was successful in persuading a school, college, American Legion hall, or coffeehouse to let him play, Denver distributed posters in the town and usually showed up at the local radio station, guitar in hand, offering himself for an interview.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newmexicomusic.org/2015/11/25/denver-john/ |title=Denver, John |publisher=New Mexico Music Commission |access-date=July 8, 2019}}</ref> As the writer of \"[[Leaving on a Jet Plane]]\", Denver was often successful in gaining some promotional airtime, usually performing one or two songs live.

Its success was due in part to the efforts of his new manager, future Hollywood producer [[Jerry Weintraub]], who signed Denver in 1970. Weintraub insisted on a reissue of the track and began a radio airplay campaign that started in Denver, Colorado. Denver's career flourished thereafter, and he had a series of hits over the next four years.

His embroidered shirts with images commonly associated with the American West were created by the designer and appliqué artist Anna Zapp. Weintraub insisted on a significant number of television appearances, including a series of half-hour shows in the United Kingdom, despite Denver's protests at the time, \"I've had no success in Britain&nbsp;... I mean ''none''\".<ref>''John Denver: Rocky Mountain Wonderboy,'' James M.

He also hosted the [[Grammy Awards]] five times in the 1970s and 1980s, and guest-hosted ''The Tonight Show'' on several occasions. In 1975, Denver was awarded the [[Country Music Association]]'s Entertainer of the Year award.

He served for many years and supported the organization until his death. President [[Jimmy Carter]] appointed Denver to serve on the President's Commission on World Hunger. Denver wrote the song \"I Want to Live\" as the commission's theme song. In 1979, Denver performed \"Rhymes & Reasons\" at the [[Music for UNICEF Concert]].

In 1976, Denver campaigned for [[Jimmy Carter]], who became a close friend and ally.

Denver also founded the environmental group Plant-It 2020 (originally Plant-It 2000).

The quantity of fuel had been depleted during the plane's flight to Monterey and in several brief practice takeoffs and landings Denver performed at the airport immediately before the final flight. His newly purchased amateur-built Rutan aircraft had an unusual fuel tank selector valve handle configuration. The handle had originally been intended by the plane's designer to be between the pilot's legs. The builder instead put it behind the pilot's left shoulder. The fuel gauge was also placed behind the pilot's seat and was not visible to the person at the controls.<ref name=\"AVW\" /><ref name=\"NTSB\" /> An NTSB interview with the aircraft mechanic servicing Denver's plane revealed that he and Denver had discussed the inaccessibility of the cockpit fuel selector valve handle and its resistance to being turned.<ref name=\"AVW\" /><ref name=\"NTSB\" />\n\nBefore the flight, Denver and the mechanic had attempted to extend the reach of the handle using a pair of [[Locking pliers|Vise-Grip pliers]], but this did not solve the problem, and the pilot still could not reach the handle while strapped into his seat. NTSB officials' post-accident investigation showed that because of the fuel selector valve’s positioning, switching fuel tanks required the pilot to turn his body 90 degrees to reach the valve. This created a natural tendency to extend one's right foot against the right rudder pedal to support oneself while turning in the seat, which caused the aircraft to [[Aircraft principal axes|yaw]] (nose right) and pitch up.<ref name=\"AVW\" /><ref name=\"NTSB\" />\n\nThe mechanic said that he told Denver that the fuel sight gauges were visible only to the rear cockpit occupant. Denver had asked how much fuel was shown. He told Denver that there was \"less than half in the right tank and less than a quarter in the left tank\". He then provided Denver with an inspection mirror so he could look over his shoulder at the fuel gauges. The mirror was later recovered from the wreckage. Denver said that he would use the autopilot in flight to hold the airplane level while he turned the fuel selector valve. He turned down an offer to refuel the aircraft, saying that he would only be flying for about an hour.<ref name=\"AVW\" /><ref name=\"NTSB\" />\n\nThe NTSB interviewed 20 witnesses about Denver's last flight. Six of them had seen the plane crash into the bay near Point Pinos.<ref name=\"AVW\" /><ref name=\"NTSB\" /> Four said the aircraft was originally heading west. Five said that they saw the plane in a steep bank, with four saying that the bank was to the right (north). Twelve described seeing the aircraft in a steep nose-down descent. Witnesses estimated the plane's altitude between {{convert|350 and 500|ft}} when heading toward the shoreline. Eight said they heard a \"pop\" or \"backfire\" accompanied by a reduction in the engine noise level just before the plane crashed into the sea.\n\nIn addition to Denver's failing to refuel and his subsequent loss of control while attempting to switch fuel tanks, the NTSB determined other key factors that led to the accident. Foremost among these was his inadequate transition training on this type of aircraft and the builder's decision to put the fuel selector handle in a hard-to-reach place.<ref name=\"AVW\" /><ref name=\"NTSB\" /> The board issued recommendations on the requirement and enforcement of mandatory training standards for pilots operating home-built aircraft. It also emphasized the importance of mandatory ease of access to all controls, including fuel selectors and fuel gauges, in all aircraft.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:JohnDenverMemorialPacificGrove.JPG|thumb|The plaque marking the location of Denver's plane crash in [[Pacific Grove, California]]]]\nUpon the announcement of Denver's death, Colorado Governor [[Roy Romer]] ordered all state flags to be lowered to [[half-mast|half-staff]] in his honor.
