He joined the [[United States Air Force]] in May 1949, and served as a [[flight engineer]] on the [[B-29 Super Fortress]] during the [[Korean War]] in the early 1950s. In [[Lincoln, Nebraska]], Martin was once sitting at a railroad crossing and a fellow that closely resembled his chief boom operator, Willie Wilson, passed by sitting in a [[boxcar]]. He said, \"There goes Willie.\" He pulled over and wrote a song entitled \"Boxcar Willie\".{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} It eventually stuck and became Martin's nickname. In 1962, Martin met his future wife, Lloene, in [[Boise, Idaho]]. They later had four children.\n\nIn [[San Jose, California]], Martin attended a talent show as \"Boxcar Willie\" and performed under that nickname for the first time. He won first place and a $150 prize. That was his part-time vocation, however, as he was still in the Air Force and had been flying daily missions. In the early 1970s, while assigned to the [[181st Airlift Squadron|136th Air Refueling Wing]] of the [[Texas Air National Guard]], Martin served as a flight engineer aboard the [[Boeing KC-97 Stratofreighter]] and participated in Operation Creek Party. This operation provided critical in-flight refueling services for fighter aircraft assigned to the [[United States Air Forces in Europe]] for 10 years.\n\nIn 1976, Martin retired from the Air Force and became a full-time performer. One of his first national appearances was a win on [[Chuck Barris]]' ''[[The Gong Show]]''. In the late 1970s, Martin traveled to [[Grand Prairie, Texas]], where he purchased hundreds of [[8-track tape]]s pre-recorded with his music to sell later in various places. After he received a contract with other recording studios, he discontinued his dealings with Cleo McDonald.{{Context inline|date=January 2023}}\n\nMartin entered American mainstream pop culture consciousness due to a series of television commercials for record compilations of artists who were obscure in the United States, yet had large international followings, such as [[Slim Whitman]] and [[Gheorghe Zamfir]]. Martin went on to become a star in [[country music]]. In 1981, Martin achieved a professional landmark by being inducted into the ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]''.<ref name=\"Larkin\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=171}}</ref> He also had success outside of the United States, with his 1980 album ''King of the Road'' giving him his greatest chart success by reaching No. 5 in the [[UK Albums Chart]].<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\">{{cite book\n| first= David| last= Roberts| year= 2006| title= [[British Hit Singles & Albums]]| edition= 19th| publisher= Guinness World Records Limited | location= London| isbn= 1-904994-10-5| page= 74}}</ref> Traveling around the world with Martin's band was his steadfast and trusty steel guitar player Chubby Howard, radio show host and musician for many years.\n\nIn 1985, Martin moved to [[Branson, Missouri]], and purchased a theater on [[Missouri Route 76]], also known as 76 Country Boulevard. In addition to the Boxcar Willie Theater, he opened a museum and eventually had two motels, both bearing his name. Martin was one of the first big stars to open a show in Branson, paving the way for the other nationally known names that followed.<ref name=\"salonobit\">[http://www.salon.com/people/obit/1999/04/14/boxcar/ \"BoxCar Willie\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041107052516/http://www.salon.com/people/obit/1999/04/14/boxcar/ |date=November 7, 2004 }}, ''Salon'' obituary, April 14, 1999.</ref> He performed at his theater in Branson until his death.\n\nOn February 23, 1992, Martin was featured on the second-season premier of ''[[Tracks Ahead]]'' in which he performed with his band at the Boxcar Willie Theater.\n\n==Death==\nMartin was diagnosed with [[leukemia]] in 1996, and died on April 12, 1999, in [[Branson, Missouri]] at the age of 67.
