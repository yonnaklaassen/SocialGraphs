The song, which peaked at No.&nbsp;11 on the [[Hot Country Songs]] charts in early 1994, served as the lead-off to their [[Blackhawk (album)|self-titled debut album]], which also produced four more singles: \"Every Once in a While\", \"I Sure Can Smell the Rain\", \"Down in Flames\", and the [[Jeff Black (singer-songwriter)|Jeff Black]]-penned \"That's Just About Right\". These songs all reached Top Ten on the country charts. ''BlackHawk'' was certified 2 × Multi-Platinum by the [[RIAA]] for shipping two million copies in the United States.\n\nAlso in 1994, they were nominated by the [[Academy of Country Music]] for the Top New Vocal Group award, along with [[Boy Howdy]] and [[Gibson/Miller Band]], but lost to Gibson/Miller.\n\n===1995–1996: ''Strong Enough''===\nBlackhawk's second album, ''[[Strong Enough (Blackhawk album)|Strong Enough]]'', was released in 1995. Its lead-off single, \"I'm Not Strong Enough to Say No\" peaked at No.&nbsp;2, followed by \"Like There Ain't No Yesterday\" at No.&nbsp;3. Both of these singles were also Number One hits on the ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' Top Country Tracks charts in Canada. However, none of the other three singles from the album reached Top Ten in either country with the exception of \"Big Guitar\" reaching No.&nbsp;8 in Canada, and \"King of the World\", the final single, fell short of the Top 40. Nonetheless, ''Strong Enough'' earned the group an RIAA gold certification for selling 500,000 copies.\n\n===1997–1999: ''Love & Gravity'' and ''The Sky's the Limit''===\n''[[Love & Gravity]]'' was the title of Blackhawk's third album, released in 1997.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> Only two singles were released from this album: the lead-off \"Hole in My Heart\" at No.&nbsp;31 and \"Postmarked Birmingham\", one of [[Phil Vassar]]'s first compositions, at No.&nbsp;37. The group's chart success was restored in late 1998, however, with the release of \"There You Have It\", which went on to peak at No.&nbsp;4. This song brought Blackhawk to the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] for the first time, peaking at No.&nbsp;41 on that chart. \"There You Have It\" was the first of two singles from 1998's ''[[The Sky's the Limit (Blackhawk album)|The Sky's the Limit]]'', which also produced the No.&nbsp;27 \"Your Own Little Corner of My Heart\".\n\n===2000–2003: ''Greatest Hits'' and ''Spirit Dancer''===\nIn 2000, Blackhawk released their ''[[Greatest Hits (Blackhawk album)|Greatest Hits]]'' collection, composed of the greatest hits from their first four albums. One of this album's newly recorded tracks, \"I Need You All the Time\", was a minor Top 40 hit on the country charts. Shortly afterward, Stephenson departed the group, due to complications from [[skin cancer]], from which he died in 2001.\n\n===2005–present===\nBlackHawk continued to tour. \n\n''Down from the Mountain'' was the band's sixth studio album and was released in 2011. It contained nine new songs from the band and a different version of the song \"Forgiveness\", which appeared on the band's previous studio album, ''Spirit Dancer.''\n\nIn 2014, Blackhawk released their seventh studio album, ''Brothers Of The Southland'' and a collection of newly recorded versions of their biggest hits, ''Greatest Hits & More'', that also included two songs from their latest studio album. \n\nA Christmas album ''The Spirit of Christmas'' was released in 2019. \n\n''Just About Right: Live From Atlanta'' is an acoustic live record recorded at Eddie's Attic in Atlanta, GA, released in 2020 and featuring members of the original backing band.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.blackhawklive.com/news/blackhawk-to-release-just-about-right-live-from-atlanta-on-friday-november-13 | title=Blackhawk to Release Just About Right: Live from Atlanta on Friday, November 13 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2022, a new album containing enhanced never-before-heard recordings with Van Stephenson titled ''Blue Highway'' was released.\n\n==Discography==\n{{main|Blackhawk discography}}\n*''[[Blackhawk (album)|Blackhawk]]'' (1994)\n*''[[Strong Enough (Blackhawk album)|Strong Enough]]'' (1995)\n*''[[Love & Gravity]]'' (1997)\n*''[[The Sky's the Limit (Blackhawk album)|The Sky's the Limit]]'' (1998)\n*''[[Spirit Dancer]]'' (2002)\n*'' Greatest Hits Live'' (2010)\n*''Down from the Mountain'' (2011)\n*''Brothers of the Southland'' (2014)\n*''Greatest Hits & More'' (2014)\n*''The Spirit of Christmas'' (2019)\n*''Just About Right: Live From Atlanta'' (2020)\n*''Blue Highway'' (2022)\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n=== American Music Awards ===\n\n{{awards table}}\n|-\n|[[American Music Awards of 1996|1996]]\n|BlackHawk\n|[[American Music Award for Favorite Country Band/Duo/Group|Favorite Country Duo or Group]]\n|{{nom}}\n|}\n\n=== TNN/Music City News Country Awards ===\n\n{{awards table}}\n|-\n|[[29th TNN/Music City News Country Awards|1995]]\n|rowspan=3| BlackHawk\n|Vocal Group or Duo of Tomorrow\n|{{won}}\n|-\n|[[31st TNN/Music City News Country Awards|1997]]\n|rowspan=2| Vocal Band of the Year\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|[[32nd TNN/Music City News Country Awards|1998]]\n|{{nom}}\n|}\n\n=== Academy of Country Music Awards ===\n\n{{awards table}}\n|-\n|[[29th Academy of Country Music Awards|1994]]\n|rowspan=3| BlackHawk\n|Top New Vocal Group or Duet\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|[[31st Academy of Country Music Awards|1996]]\n|rowspan=2| Top Vocal Group of the Year\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|[[32nd Academy of Country Music Awards|1997]]\n|{{nom}}\n|}\n\n=== Country Music Association Awards ===\n\n{{awards table}}\n|-\n|[[1995 Country Music Association Awards|1995]]\n|rowspan=2| BlackHawk\n|rowspan=2| [[Country Music Association Award for Vocal Group of the Year|Vocal Group of the Year]]\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|[[1996 Country Music Association Awards|1996]]\n|{{nom}}\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n;Footnotes\n{{notelist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://blackhawklive.com/ Official website]\n* {{IMDb name|nm9771959}}\n\n{{Blackhawk}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Blackhawk (Band)}}\n[[Category:Country music groups from Tennessee]]\n[[Category:Arista Nashville artists]]\n[[Category:Columbia Records artists]]\n[[Category:Musical groups established in 1992]]\n[[Category:Musical groups from Nashville, Tennessee]]\n[[Category:1992 establishments in Tennessee]]\n[[Category:Vocal trios]]"
