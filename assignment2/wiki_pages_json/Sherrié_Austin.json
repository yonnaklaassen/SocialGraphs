Active as a singer since her teenage years, Austin initially recorded as one half of the duo '''Colourhaus''', which also featured Phil Radford. After leaving Colourhaus, she moved to the United States in pursuit of a solo career. There, she recorded five studio albums, and charted several singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts. Her highest charting single was the No.&nbsp;18 \"[[Streets of Heaven (song)|Streets of Heaven]]\" in 2003. Her most recent album was released on 15 November 2011.\n\n==Career==\n===Early career===\nAustin got her start in music opening for [[Johnny Cash]] in Australia at the age of 14. She later moved to the United States where she took up acting. She is most known in the United States for playing the role of Pippa McKenna on ''[[The Facts of Life (TV series)|The Facts of Life]]'' during its final season.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.monagiza.com/stories/now-facts-life-cast/|title=Where are they now?

Her first solo contract was with [[Arista Nashville]], with the album ''[[Words (Sherrié Austin album)|Words]]'' being released in 1997. It produced singles in \"Lucky in Love\", \"One Solitary Tear\", \"Put Your Heart into It\", and \"Innocent Man\". \"Lucky in Love\" and \"Put Your Heart into It\" both reached Top 40 on the country charts with a peak of No.&nbsp;34 each.\n\nHer second and final album for Arista was 1999's ''[[Love in the Real World]]'', led off by the No.&nbsp;29 \"Never Been Kissed\", which was followed by \"Little Bird\". After RCA acquired Arista Records, Austin's publishing company, Reynsong Publishing, formed Wrensong Entertainment and signed to [[Madacy Entertainment]] for her next album, ''[[Followin' a Feelin']]'', which produced another single in its lead-off single, a cover of [[Dolly Parton]]'s \"[[Jolene (song)|Jolene]]\".\n\nLater, she switched to the independent [[Broken Bow Records]] label. Her fourth album of country music, titled ''[[Streets of Heaven (album)|Streets of Heaven]]'', produced her biggest country hit in its [[Streets of Heaven (song)|title track]]. Following this single was \"[[Son of a Preacher Man]]\", a cover of the [[Dusty Springfield]] song, which was never included on an album.\n\n===Broadway years===\nAustin moved to New York City in 2005 and appeared in the New York Musical Theater Festival's production of ''Bonnie & Clyde''. ''The New York Times'' commented that she was \"a sultry young country music singer who plays the notorious criminal Bonnie Parker and does for this musical what [[Reba McEntire]] did for the 1999 revival of ''[[Annie Get Your Gun (musical)|Annie Get Your Gun]].'' That twang in her voice provides some much-needed authenticity in excellent pop-country numbers like \"Ain't Goin' Back.\" And it's easy to tell by her hip-swiveling poses that this is a woman who knows how to hold a stage.\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Zinoman |first=Jason |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01E1D61730F930A1575AC0A9639C8B63 |title=NEW YORK MUSICAL THEATER FESTIVAL REVIEWS – The Ballad of Bonnie and Clyde – Review – NYTimes.com |newspaper=The New York Times|date=23 September 2005 |access-date=9 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe following year, Austin performed in ''Ring of Fire – The Johnny Cash Musical Show''<ref>{{cite web |author=The Broadway League |url=http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=406669 |title=Ring of Fire &#124; IBDB: The official source for Broadway Information |publisher=IBDB |access-date=9 April 2012}}</ref> at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre.

I wanted to write a three-minute song with every ''[[Sex and the City]]'' episode that had ever existed, so I did. I quickly noticed that the women in my audiences loved it and so I switched my songwriting focus for a while to concentrate on that audience, who are my peers, to speak to them\", says Austin.<ref name=\"SherrieAustinMusic.com\" />\n\n''Circus Girl'' was released independently on 15 November 2011.\n\n==Discography==\n=== Studio albums ===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:14em;\"| Title\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:18em;\"| Album details\n! colspan=\"4\" | Peak chart positions\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n! style=\"width:45px;\"| [[Top Country Albums|US Country]]\n! style=\"width:45px;\"| [[Billboard 200|US]]\n! style=\"width:45px;\"| [[Independent Albums|US Indie]]\n! style=\"width:45px;\"| [[Top Heatseekers|US Heat]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | ''Water to the Soul''<br /><small>(as Colourhaus)</small>\n|\n* Release date: 21 April 1992\n* Label: [[Interscope Records]]\n| —\n| —\n| —\n| —\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | ''[[Words (Sherrié Austin album)|Words]]''\n|\n* Release date: 15 July 1997\n* Label: [[Arista Nashville]]\n| 41\n| —\n| —\n| 35\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | ''[[Love in the Real World]]''\n|\n* Release date: 10 August 1999\n* Label: Arista Nashville\n| 14\n| 150\n| —\n| 8\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | ''[[Followin' a Feelin']]''\n|\n* Release date: 20 March 2001\n* Label: [[Madacy Entertainment]]\n| 43\n| —\n| 38\n| —\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | ''[[Streets of Heaven (album)|Streets of Heaven]]''\n|\n* Release date: 12 August 2003\n* Label: [[Broken Bow Records]]\n| 22\n| 144\n| 6\n| 3\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | ''[[Circus Girl (album)|Circus Girl]]''\n|\n* Release date: 15 November 2011\n* Label: Circus Girl, LLC\n| —\n| —\n| —\n| —\n|-\n| colspan=\"6\" style=\"font-size:8pt\"| \"—\" denotes releases that did not chart\n|}\n\n===Singles===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Year\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:14em;\"| Single\n! colspan=\"3\" | Peak chart positions\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Album\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n! style=\"width:45px;\"| [[Hot Country Songs|US Country]]<br /><ref name=\"whitburn\">{{cite book |last=Whitburn |first=Joel |title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2008 |publisher=Record Research, Inc |page=36 |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-89820-177-2 }}</ref>\n! style=\"width:45px;\"| [[Billboard Hot 100|US]]<br /><ref name=\"whitburn\" />\n! style=\"width:45px;\"| [[RPM (magazine)|CAN Country]]\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 1992\n! scope=\"row\" | \"Innocent Child\"\n| —\n| 50\n| —\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| ''Water to the Soul'' {{small|(as Colourhaus)}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | \"Moving Mountains\"\n| —\n| —\n| —\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 1997\n! scope=\"row\" | \"Lucky in Love\"\n| 34\n| —\n| 31\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" rowspan=\"5\" | ''Words''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | \"One Solitary Tear\"\n| 41\n| —\n| 85\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" | 1998\n! scope=\"row\" | \"Put Your Heart into It\"\n| 34\n| —{{efn|\"Put Your Heart into It\" did not enter the Hot 100, but peaked at number 4 on [[Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles]], which acts as a 25-song extension of the Hot 100.}}\n| 36\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | \"Tenderly\"\n| —\n| —\n| —\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | \"Innocent Man\"\n| 74\n| —\n| 87\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 1999\n! scope=\"row\" | \"Never Been Kissed\"\n| 29\n| 89\n| 31\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" rowspan=\"2\" | ''Love in the Real World''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | \"Little Bird\"\n| 49\n| —\n| 43\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" | 2001\n! scope=\"row\" | \"[[Jolene (song)|Jolene]]\"\n| 55\n| —\n| —\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" rowspan=\"3\" | ''Followin' a Feelin'''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | \"Time, Love & Money\"\n| —\n| —\n| —\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | \"In the Meantime\"\n| —\n| —\n| —\n|-\n| 2003\n! scope=\"row\" | \"[[Streets of Heaven (song)|Streets of Heaven]]\"\n| 18\n| —{{efn|\"Streets of Heaven\" did not enter the Hot 100, but peaked at number 13 on Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles, which acts as a 25-song extension of the Hot 100.}}\n| —\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" rowspan=\"2\" | ''Streets of Heaven''\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 2004\n! scope=\"row\" | \"Drivin' Into the Sun\"\n| 50\n| —\n| —\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | \"[[Son of a Preacher Man]]\"\n| 46\n| —\n| —\n| {{n/a}}\n|-\n| colspan=\"6\" style=\"font-size:8pt\"| \"—\" denotes releases that did not chart\n|}\n;Notes\n{{notelist}}\n\n===Music videos===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!
