Haggerty was the sixth of ten children. He has stated that his parents, particularly his father, were very accepting of his sexuality and effeminate personality, with his father encouraging him to [[come out]] and to not “sneak”.<ref name=\"nytimesobit\"/> Haggerty attended Port Angeles Senior High in [[Port Angeles]], Washington, from 1958 to 1962, where he was “pep promoter”, which was similar to being head cheerleader.<ref>[http://www.glbtq.com/arts/country_music.html \"Country Music\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130714140833/http://www.glbtq.com/arts/country_music.html |date=2013-07-14 }}.
