She had several years of major commercial success in the late 1980s after signing a record deal at age 45. Oslin had four number one hits and placed additional singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country chart during that timespan; in addition, she won three [[Grammy Awards]] and is an inductee of the [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]].\n\nOslin moved to Alabama after the death of her father, then to Texas. She developed an appreciation for [[folk music]] while studying theater in college and later started a folk trio. In 1966, she returned to theater after being cast in the touring production of ''[[Hello, Dolly! (musical)|Hello, Dolly!]]'' She then moved to [[New York City]], where she continued acting in Broadway musicals and television commercials. At the same time, she began songwriting as a hobby. After a demo recording was made of her music, Oslin briefly signed to [[Elektra Records]] in 1981 without much success. She later signed to [[RCA Records]] in 1986 and had her first major hit the following year with \"[[80's Ladies (song)|80's Ladies]]\". Her 1987 [[80's Ladies|debut album of the same name]] would sell over one million copies and produce three additional hits, including the number one single \"[[Do Ya (K. T. Oslin song)|Do Ya]]\".\n\nOslin released ''[[This Woman (K. T. Oslin album)|This Woman]]'' (1988) and ''[[Love in a Small Town]]'' (1990), which reached the top ten of the ''Billboard'' charts. The albums spawned hit singles including \"[[Hold Me (K. T. Oslin song)|Hold Me]]\", \"[[Hey Bobby]]\" and \"[[Come Next Monday]]\". In the early 1990s, she left her recording contract and went into a hiatus following several personal setbacks. In 1996, she returned with the studio album ''[[\"My Roots Are Showing...\"]]'' and then in 2001 with ''[[Live Close By, Visit Often]].'' Oslin released her final album in 2015 titled ''[[Simply (K. T. Oslin album)|Simply]].''\n\n==Early years==\nOslin was born in [[Crossett, Arkansas]], in 1942 to Larry and Kathleen Oslin.
