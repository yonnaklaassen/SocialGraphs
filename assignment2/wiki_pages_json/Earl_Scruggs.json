His three-finger style of playing was radically different from the traditional way the five-string banjo had previously been played. This new style of playing became popular and elevated the banjo from its previous role as a background rhythm instrument to featured solo status. He popularized the instrument across several genres of music.\n\nScruggs' career began at age 21 when he was hired to play in [[Bill Monroe]]'s band, the Blue Grass Boys. \"Bluegrass\" eventually became the name for an entire genre of country music. Despite considerable success with Monroe, performing on the [[Grand Ole Opry]] and recording classic hits such as \"[[Blue Moon of Kentucky]]\", Scruggs resigned from the group in 1948 because of their exhausting touring schedule. Fellow band member [[Lester Flatt]] resigned as well, and he and Scruggs later paired up in the duo [[Flatt and Scruggs]]. Scruggs' banjo instrumental \"[[Foggy Mountain Breakdown]]\" was recorded in December 1949 and released in March 1950. The song became an enduring hit. The song experienced a rebirth of popularity to a younger generation when it was featured in the 1967 film ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]''. The song won two [[Grammy Award]]s and, in 2005, was selected for the Library of Congress' [[National Recording Registry]] of works of unusual merit.\n\nFlatt and Scruggs brought bluegrass music into mainstream popularity in the early 1960s with their country hit \"[[The Ballad of Jed Clampett]]\", the theme music for the television sitcom ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]''—the first Scruggs recording to reach number one on the [[Billboard charts]]. Over their 20-year association, Flatt and Scruggs recorded over 50 albums and 75 [[Single (music)|singles]]. The duo broke up in 1969, chiefly because, while Scruggs wanted to switch styles to fit a more modern sound, Flatt was a traditionalist who opposed the change and believed doing so would alienate a fan base of bluegrass purists. Although each of them formed a new band to match their visions, neither of them ever regained the success they had achieved as a team.\n \nScruggs received four Grammy awards, a [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] and a [[List of recipients of the National Medal of Arts|National Medal of Arts]]. He became a member of the [[International Bluegrass Music Hall of Fame]] and was given a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. In 1985, Flatt and Scruggs were inducted together into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] and named, as a duo, number 24 on [[CMT (U.S. TV channel)|CMT]]'s \"40 Greatest Men of Country Music\". Scruggs was awarded a [[National Heritage Fellowship]] by the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], the highest honor in the [[Folk music|folk]] and traditional arts in the United States. Four works by Scruggs have been placed in the [[Grammy Hall of Fame]]. After Scruggs' death in 2012 at age 88, the [[Cleveland County Courthouse (Shelby, North Carolina)|Earl Scruggs Center]] was founded in Shelby, North Carolina, near his birthplace with the aid of a federal grant and corporate donors. The center is a $5.5 million facility that features the musical contributions of Scruggs and serves as an educational center providing classes and field trips for students.\n\n==Early life==\n{{external media | width = 210px | float = right | audio1 = [https://freshairarchive.org/segments/bluegrass-musician-earl-scruggs-1 Bluegrass Musician Earl Scruggs], interviewed by [[Terry Gross]] on ''[[Fresh Air]]'', 34:58, January 9, 2004.<ref name=\"Fresh Air\">{{cite web |title=Bluegrass Musician Earl Scruggs |work=[[Fresh Air]] |publisher=[[WHYY-FM|WHYY]] ([[NPR]]) |date=January 9, 2004 |url=https://freshairarchive.org/segments/bluegrass-musician-earl-scruggs-1 |access-date=September 15, 2019}}</ref> }}\n\nEarl Scruggs was born January 6, 1924, in the Flint Hill community of [[Cleveland County, North Carolina|Cleveland County]], North Carolina, a small community just outside of [[Boiling Springs, North Carolina|Boiling Springs]], about 10 miles west of [[Shelby, North Carolina|Shelby]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Reitwiesner |first=William Addams |title=Ancestry of Earl Scruggs |publisher=William Addams Reitwiesner Genealogical Services |url=http://www.wargs.com/other/scruggs.html |access-date=July 14, 2009 |author-link=William Addams Reitwiesner |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109065732/http://www.wargs.com/other/scruggs.html |archive-date=January 9, 2009}}</ref> His father, George Elam Scruggs, was a farmer and a bookkeeper who died of a protracted illness when Earl was four years old.<ref name=\"scruggsbio\">{{cite web |url=http://earlscruggs.com/biography.html |title=Earl Scruggs Biography |publisher=Earlscruggs.com |access-date=March 28, 2012}}</ref> Upon his father's death, Scruggs' mother, Georgia Lula Ruppe (called Lula), was left to take care of the farm and five children, of which Earl was the youngest.<ref name=\"biography-dot-com\">{{cite web |title=Earl Scruggs Biography |url=http://www.biography.com/people/earl-scruggs-20638979#synopsis |website=biography.com |publisher=A&E Television Networks |access-date=February 20, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222052637/http://www.biography.com/people/earl-scruggs-20638979#synopsis |archive-date=February 22, 2017 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe family members all played music.
