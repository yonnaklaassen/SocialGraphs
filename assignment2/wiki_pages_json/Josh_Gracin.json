He grew up listening to [[Elvis]], the Beatles and to vintage rock and pop on a favorite local station. When he was 11 the station changed its format to country, and he was introduced to artists such as [[Garth Brooks]], [[Joe Diffie]], [[George Strait]] and [[Randy Travis]].<ref name=\"about\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.joshgracin.com/|title=Josh Gracin|website=Joshgracin.com}}</ref> These artist's songs immediately caught his interest. \"There's not another genre that better reflects situations in my life,\" Gracin said.<ref name=\"about\" />\n<ref name=\"mtv\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/gracin_josh/bio.jhtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040724075439/http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/gracin_josh/bio.jhtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 24, 2004 |title=Josh Gracin : Biography |publisher=CMT.com |access-date=August 30, 2010}}</ref> His vocal debut was in an Easter musical presented by his local church. His first public appearance was at an eighth grade talent competition where he sang Brooks' 1993 hit \"Standing Outside the Fire\" and easily won over an audience full of more traditional dance music-loving cohorts.<ref name=\"mtv\" />\n\nLater, Gracin auditioned, as the only male, for a national pop orchestra and vocal competition, known as the Fairlane Youth Pops Orchestra, and won as a sophomore in high school.<ref name=\"mtv\" />  During his high school career Gracin performed at state festivals, fairs, and pageants throughout the State of Michigan.  At 16, he performed on stage at the [[Grand Ole Opry]] in a national talent show <ref name=\"mtv\" /> and recorded a demo CD in [[Nashville, Tennessee]].\n\nUpon graduation from [[John Glenn High School (Westland, Michigan)|John Glenn High School]] in Westland, he attended [[Western Michigan University]] before he joined the United States Marine Corps.<ref name=\"mtv\" />  After basic training, he returned to marry his wife and was assigned to [[Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton|Camp Pendleton]] as a supply clerk.\n\n== Career ==\n\n=== 2003–2005: ''Josh Gracin'' ===\nIn 2003, Gracin auditioned for the second season of ''[[American Idol]]''. He made it to the finals and eventually came in fourth place on the show. However, because of his earlier commitment to the Marine Corps, Gracin was not able to participate in the lucrative American Idol Finalists tour of American venues.<ref name=\"about\" />  Gracin was instead sent on a year-long tour as a recruiter, making appearances at special events around the United States to promote the [[United States Marine Corps]]. After completing his fourth year of service, he was honorably discharged in September 2004.\n\nGracin's true transition from reality show finalist to recording star began when he sang [[Rascal Flatts]]' \"I'm Movin' On\" on one episode of ''American Idol''. As Rascal Flatts watched that episode on their tour bus, bass player Jay DeMarcus was impressed with Gracin's talent and reached out to him. He connected Gracin with Marty Williams, who had co-produced both of Rascal Flatts' breakthrough album and its successful follow-up. That set in motion a series of events (with a short one-year break to finish his Marine stint) that led to a record deal with [[Lyric Street Records]] in 2004.<ref name=\"mtv\" /> His debut album ''[[Josh Gracin (album)|Josh Gracin]]'' was released on June 15, 2004, and was certified [[gold album|gold]]. The album's first three singles (\"I Want to Live,\" \"Nothin' to Lose,\" and \"Stay with Me [Brass Bed]\"), all reached the top five on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Singles & Tracks]] chart, with \"Nothin' to Lose,\" the second of those three, reaching Number One.<ref name=\"about\" />\n\nIn 2005, Gracin also contributed the song \"[[Working for the Weekend]]\" to the ''[[Herbie: Fully Loaded (soundtrack)|Herbie: Fully Loaded]]'' soundtrack, and he also sang on \"When I See an Elephant Fly\" on the [[Jim Brickman]] album ''The Disney Songbook''.<ref name=\"about\" />  At a performance in 2006, Gracin filled in, with good reviews, for [[Lonestar]]'s lead vocalist [[Richie McDonald]] in concert when McDonald was recovering from a back injury.<ref name=Lonestar2006>{{cite news|access-date=August 13, 2008|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/news-in-brief/1547658/josh-gracin-sings-lead-at-lonestar-concert.jhtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606180024/http://www.cmt.com/news/news-in-brief/1547658/josh-gracin-sings-lead-at-lonestar-concert.jhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 6, 2011|work=CMT News|title=Josh Gracin Sings Lead at Lonestar Concert|date=December 8, 2006}}</ref>\n\n=== 2006–2008: ''We Weren't Crazy'' ===\n[[File:Gracin visits Warren 070815-F-0474R-001.jpg|thumb|Gracin performing in 2007]]\nIn March 2006, Gracin released his fourth single, \"Favorite State of Mind.\" Although it was a Top 20 hit on the country chart, Gracin's second album was delayed. Originally slated to be titled ''All About Y'all'', the second album was later re-titled ''I Keep Coming Back'' and then finally ''[[We Weren't Crazy]]'', after the title of its third single. \"We Weren't Crazy,\" the third release from the album, entered the country music charts in October 2007, and for the chart week dated August 2, 2008 (40 weeks after it debuted on the charts), it reached a peak of number 10. The album was finally released on April 1, 2008.
