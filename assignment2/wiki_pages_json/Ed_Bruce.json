Bruce caught the attention of Sun owner [[Sam Phillips]], for whom he wrote and recorded \"Rock Boppin' Baby\" (as \"Edwin Bruce\").\n\n==1960s==\nIn the early 1960s, Bruce recorded for [[RCA Records|RCA]] and some smaller labels like [[Wand Records|Wand]]/[[Scepter Records|Scepter]], singing [[rockabilly]] music, as well as country material and pop material such as \"See the Big Man Cry\". In 1962, he wrote \"Save Your Kisses\" for pop star [[Tommy Roe]] and in 1963 he reached No.&nbsp;109 on the ''Billboard'' \"Bubbling Under\" chart with his own recording of \"See the Big Man Cry\" (Wand 140), both published by [[Bill Justis]] at Tuneville Music. [[Charlie Louvin]] recorded \"See the Big Man Cry\" (Capitol 5369) in 1965; Louvin's version reached No.&nbsp;7 on the ''Billboard'' \"Country Singles\" chart. During his career many songs that Bruce wrote and recorded were more successful when re-recorded by others.\n\nIn 1966, Bruce returned to [[RCA Records|RCA]] and recorded \"Puzzles\", \"The Price I Pay to Stay\" and \"Lonesome Is Me\". He scored his first charted single with \"Walker's Woods\" in 1967, and also charted with his version of [[The Monkees]]' \"[[Last Train to Clarksville]]\". Both of these singles were minor hits. In 1969, Bruce signed with [[Monument Records]], where he continued to have minor successes with \"Everybody Wants To Get To Heaven\" and \"Song For Jenny\".\n\n==1970s==\nBruce wrote \"[[The Man That Turned My Mama On]]\" which became a major hit for [[Tanya Tucker]] in 1974, as was his \"Restless\" for [[Crystal Gayle]] the same year. He signed with [[United Artists Records]] in 1973 and released several singles, but only one single in 1974 became a minor hit. Bruce finally made the Top 20 on country charts with his version of \"[[Mammas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys]]\", a song he wrote with then-wife [[Patsy Bruce]], in 1976.\n\nTwo more Top 40 hits followed for Bruce in 1976, and in 1977, he signed with [[Epic Records]] where he would score minor hits. In 1978, \"Mammas Don't Let Your Babies Grow up to Be Cowboys\" was recorded by [[Willie Nelson]] and [[Waylon Jennings]]. It became a major hit, and continued the upward swing in Bruce's career. In 1979, Tanya Tucker took Bruce's 1977 song \"[[Texas (When I Die)]]\" into the country Top 5.\n\n==1980s==\nIn 1980, Bruce signed with [[MCA Records]], where he would score his biggest successes. His early hits with MCA included \"Diane\", \"The Last Cowboy Song\", \"When You Fall In Love (Everything's A Waltz)\", \"Evil Angel\", and \"Love's Found You And Me\". His biggest hit, \"[[You're the Best Break This Old Heart Ever Had]]\" went to number one on the country chart in 1982. This was also Bruce's first Top 10 hit as a singer after 15 years. He had other hit songs that made the Top 10 like \"Ever, Never Lovin' You\"; \"My First Taste of Texas\"; and \"After All\".\n\nIn 1984, Bruce returned to [[RCA Records]] and scored a No. 3 hit with \"You Turn Me On Like A Radio\" in 1985. His last Top 10 single was \"[[Nights (Ed Bruce song)|Nights]]\" in 1986 and his last Top 40 single (and last chart single to date) was \"Quietly Crazy\" in 1987.\n\n==Acting==\nBruce supplemented his songwriting income doing [[voice-overs]] for [[television commercials|television]] and [[radio commercials]].<ref name=\"Country Music Television\">{{cite web|title=Country Music – Music News, New Songs, Videos, Music Shows and Playlists from CMT|url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/bruce_ed/bio.jhtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040730164351/http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/bruce_ed/bio.jhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 30, 2004|access-date=August 28, 2018|website=Cmt.com}}</ref> After the 1986 album entitled ''Night Things'' and a [[country music|1988]] self-titled follow-up, Bruce made a conscious decision to cut back on his music to focus on his acting career, appearing in several [[made-for-TV]] films.<ref name=\"Country Music Television\" /> He hosted two shows in the late 1980s, ''Truckin' USA'' and ''American Sports Cavalcade''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Welcome to Ed Bruce's Web Site!|url=http://edbrucemusic.com/|access-date=August 28, 2018|website=Edbrucemusic.com}}</ref> He had the second lead on the [[television]] revival of 1957's ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]'', called ''[[Bret Maverick]]''.
