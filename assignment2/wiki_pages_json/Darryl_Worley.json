(album)|Have You Forgotten?]]'' (2003), and ''[[Darryl Worley (album)|Darryl Worley]]'' in 2004. After the label closed in 2005, he moved to 903 Music, an independent label owned by [[Neal McCoy]], releasing ''[[Here and Now (Darryl Worley album)|Here and Now]]'' in 2006, shortly before that label's closure. His most recent studio release is 2009's ''[[Sounds Like Life]]'' via [[Stroudavarious Records]], owned by [[James Stroud]].\n\nWorley's six albums have produced 18 singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts, including three number ones: \"[[I Miss My Friend (song)|I Miss My Friend]]\", \"[[Have You Forgotten?]]\", and \"[[Awful, Beautiful Life]]\", from 2002, 2003 and 2004–2005, respectively. \"Have You Forgotten?\" spent seven weeks at number one.

He worked in the chemical industry prior to pursuing country music, and wrote for [[FAME Studios]] in [[Muscle Shoals, Alabama]]. One of his first cuts as a songwriter was a track on [[Archer/Park]]'s 1994 debut album.\n\n==Musical career==\n\n===Hard Rain Don't Last (1999–2001)===\nWorley was signed to [[DreamWorks Records]] in 1999. His debut single \"[[When You Need My Love]]\" followed in March 2000, the first of four single releases from his debut album ''[[Hard Rain Don't Last]]''. Following this song were \"[[A Good Day to Run]]\", \"Second Wind\" and \"Sideways\". Respectively, these singles peaked at No.&nbsp;15, No.&nbsp;12, No.&nbsp;20 and No.&nbsp;41 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country charts. Production duties on the album were split between [[Frank Rogers (record producer)|Frank Rogers]] and [[James Stroud]]. Also in 2000, [[George Jones]] charted with the single \"Sinners & Saints\", which Worley co-wrote.\n\n===I Miss My Friend (2002)===\nHis second album, ''[[I Miss My Friend]]'' became his first Number One hit on the country charts that year, and was followed by the top 30 \"Family Tree\", written by [[Darrell & Scott]]. This album was also his first Number One album on [[Top Country Albums]].\n\n===Have You Forgotten? (2003)===\nWorley had his biggest hit in 2003 with the [[9/11]] tribute ballad \"[[Have You Forgotten?]]\", the first release from his 2003 compilation album of the [[Have You Forgotten? (album)|same name]]. It reached Number One in its fifth week on the charts, and held its position for seven weeks. The album included only four new tracks counting \"Have You Forgotten?\", as well as six each from his first and second albums. \"Tennessee River Run\", one of the carryovers from ''I Miss My Friend'', was issued as a single in 2003, peaking at No.&nbsp;31. After it came his lowest-peaking single, \"I Will Hold My Ground\" at No.&nbsp;57. ''Have You Forgotten?'' is also certified [[gold album|gold]] by the [[RIAA]].\n\n===Darryl Worley (2004–2005)===\n2004 saw the release of Worley's third studio album, the self-titled ''[[Darryl Worley (album)|Darryl Worley]]''. Its lead-off single, the [[Harley Allen]] co-write \"[[Awful, Beautiful Life]]\", became his third Number One hit in early 2005. Following this song was the Top Ten \"If Something Should Happen\", as well as \"I Love Her, She Hates Me\", which stopped at No.&nbsp;56 due to the closure of DreamWorks Records in mid-2005.\n\n===Here and Now (2006–2007)===\nLater that same year,  Worley signed with country singer [[Neal McCoy]]'s vanity label 903 Music. His first release for 903 was \"Nothin' but a Love Thang\", which peaked at No.&nbsp;35. This was the first of three singles from ''[[Here and Now (Darryl Worley album)|Here and Now]]'', his fourth studio album. Also released from it were the Top 20 \"[[I Just Came Back from a War]]\" and the No.&nbsp;54 \"Livin' in the Here and Now\", the chart run of which was halted by the closure of 903 music in May 2007.<ref>[http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/content_display/industry/e3i6aa5bb36869cfa84fd7b70898175ddec McCoy's 903 Music To Shut Down<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n===Sounds Like Life (2008–2010)===\nWorley signed in 2008 to his third recording contract, this time with [[Stroudavarious Records]], a label that Stroud founded in 2008. His sixteenth chart entry, \"Tequila on Ice\", was issued in the middle of that year, peaking at No.&nbsp;44. Following it was \"Sounds Like Life to Me\", which has reached the Top 20.
