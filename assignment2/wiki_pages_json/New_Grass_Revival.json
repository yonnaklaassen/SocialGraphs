They were active between 1971 and 1989, releasing more than twenty albums as well as six singles. Their highest-charting single is \"[[Callin' Baton Rouge]]\", which peaked at No.&nbsp;37 on the U.S. country charts in 1989 and was a Top 5 country hit for [[Garth Brooks]] five years later.\n\nIn 2020, the group were inducted into the [[International Bluegrass Music Hall of Fame|Bluegrass Music Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bluegrasstoday.com/2020-winners-of-the-international-bluegrass-music-awards/|title=2020 winners of the International Bluegrass Music Awards|website=Bluegrasstoday.com|date=2 October 2020|access-date=August 8, 2021}}</ref>\n\n==Origin==\nThe origins of New Grass Revival lay in the Bluegrass Alliance, which Sam Bush (vocals, fiddle, guitar, mandolin) and Courtney Johnson (banjo, vocals) joined in 1970.<ref name=\"AMG\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/new-grass-revival-mn0000391519/biography|title=New Grass Revival &#124; Biography & History|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=August 8, 2021}}</ref> At the time, the Alliance also featured bassist Ebo Walker and fiddler Lonnie Peerce.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> Following this, Curtis Burch (dobro, guitar, vocals) joined the band, whilst in 1972, Peerce left the band, but the remaining members decided to continue under the new name New Grass Revival.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> The band released their debut album, ''[[New Grass Revival (1972 album)|The Arrival of the New Grass Revival]]'', later in 1972 on Starday Records.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Country Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1993|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-726-6|page=288}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Separation from mainstream bluegrass===\nThe New Grass Revival bucked tradition, with long hair, informal clothing, and performances of songs from a variety of genres, including music by [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] (\"[[Great Balls of Fire]]\"), the [[Beatles]] (\"[[Get Back]]\"; \"[[I'm Down]]\"), and [[Bob Marley]] (\"[[One Love/People Get Ready]]\"), plus protest songs (\"[[One Tin Soldier]]\").

Pat Flynn also brought strong lead and harmony vocals to the group as well as a distinctive guitar style.\n\nIn 1984, the group moved to Sugar Hill Records, and released their first album featuring the new line-up, ''On the Boulevard''.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> In 1986, the band signed with EMI Records and released [[New Grass Revival (1986 album)|an eponymous album]], which proved to be their breakthrough into the mainstream.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> Two of the singles from the album, \"What You Do to Me\" and \"Ain't That Peculiar\", were minor hits on the country chart, and Fleck's showcase \"Seven by Seven\" was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] for Best Country Instrumental.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> ''Hold to a Dream'', released in 1987 contained hit singles including \"Unconditional Love\" and \"Can't Stop Now.\"<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nIn 1989, New Grass Revival released their third major-label album, ''[[Friday Night in America]]'', which was another commercial success.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> \"Callin' Baton Rouge\" became their first Top 40 single, followed by the number 58 hit \"You Plant Your Fields.\" Even though the band was more popular than ever, Bush decided to pull the plug on the group after the release of ''Friday Night in America''.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> Bush formed The Sam Bush Band, and Fleck went on to a successful and respected solo career. \n[[Image:Ngr reunion2.jpg|right|thumb|New Grass Revival reunion at beneficial concert for [[Courtney Johnson (musician)|Courtney Johnson]] in 1996.
