He married Mary Lou Taylor, who was more than three years his senior, at age seventeen and began working days in an airplane factory.  He still played in rock and country bands at night.  While playing in an [[Okeechobee, Florida]], honky-tonk known as the Wagon Wheel, Stewart met country singer [[Mel Tillis]], who advised Stewart to travel to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] to pitch his songs.  He recorded a few songs for the small Cory label in 1964 and began co-writing songs with local policeman Bill Eldridge.  Stewart and Eldridge wrote [[Stonewall Jackson (musician)|Stonewall Jackson's]] 1965 country hit, \"Poor Red Georgia Dirt\". Signed to the [[Kapp Records|Kapp]] label in 1968, Stewart made several unsuccessful recordings but several songwriting successes followed, for artists like [[Billy Walker (musician)|Billy Walker]] (\"She Goes Walking Through My Mind\", \"Traces of a Woman\", \"It's Time to Love Her\"), [[Cal Smith]] (\"You Can't Housebreak a Tomcat\", \"It Takes Me All Night Long\"), and [[Nat Stuckey]] (\"Sweet Thang And Cisco\"). He even played piano for a time in [[Charley Pride]]'s band the Pridesmen, and can be heard on Pride's live ''In Person'' double-album. Disappointed with [[Music Row]], however, he soon returned to Florida and resumed playing countrified rock 'n' roll in local clubs and bars.<ref>''Country Music: The Rough Guide'', pp. 376–377; \"A Honky-Tonk Man\"; \"Little Junior, King of the Honky-Tonks: The Life and Death of Gary Stewart\"; ''Gary Stewart: Biography''; {{cite book | last = Stambler | first = Irwin | author2 = Grelun Landon | title = Country Music: The Encyclopedia | publisher = St. Martin's Press | year = 1997 | location = New York | pages = [https://archive.org/details/countrymusicency00stam/page/464 464–465] | url = https://archive.org/details/countrymusicency00stam/page/464 | isbn = 0-312-15121-7 | url-access = registration }}, {{cite book | last = Bogdanov | first = Vladimir |author2=Chris Woodstra |author3=Stephen Thomas Erlewine  | title = All Music Guide to Country: The Definitive Guide to Country Music | publisher = Backbeat Books | year = 2003 | location = San Francisco | pages = 721–722 | isbn = 0-87930-760-9}}</ref>  In 1970 [[Motown Records]], hoping to get Nashville artists to record their songs, paid Stewart $30 to record countrified demos of \"[[Baby I Need Your Loving]]\", \"[[Yester-Me, Yester-You, Yesterday]]\", and \"[[I Can't Help Myself (Sugar Pie Honey Bunch)]]\".<ref name=\"Betts\">{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/hear-tragic-country-singer-gary-stewarts-rare-motown-demo-for-record-store-day-629194/ |title=Hear Tragic Country Singer Gary Stewart's Rare Motown Demo for Record Store Day |last=Betts |first=Stephen L. |publisher=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=2018-04-20 |access-date=2020-07-31 }}</ref>\n\n== Peak of career ==\n{{quote box|quoted=1|quote=In case it's not clear why [[rock and roll]]ers are so excited about a new [[country music|country]] singer, it's because he really sings [[rockabilly]], which supposedly flourished for a few years in the mid-'50s and then vanished.

He returned to Nashville in 1973 and recorded a cover version of \"[[Ramblin' Man (Allman Brothers Band song)|Ramblin' Man]]\" by the [[The Allman Brothers Band|Allman Brothers]], both of whom were Stewart's personal friends. It charted at only #63 on the country chart, but his follow-up, 1974's \"Drinkin' Thing\" became a top ten hit. His album ''[[Out of Hand]]'' was released in early 1975. \"Out of Hand\", the title cut, became a #4 country hit and was followed by the #1 hit \"She's Actin' Single (I'm Drinkin' Doubles)\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''Country Music: The Rough Guide'', pp. 376–377; \"A Honky-Tonk Man\"; \"Little Junior, King of the Honky-Tonks: The Life and Death of Gary Stewart\"; ''Gary Stewart: Biography''; ''Country Music: The Encyclopedia'', pp. 464–465; ''All Music Guide to Country: The Definitive Guide to Country Music'', pp. 721–722.</ref><ref name=\"Betts\"/>\n\nThe album ''Out of Hand'', which climbed to #6 on the Billboard country album chart, has since become one of the most critically lauded country albums of the 1970s.

For the rest of the 1970s Stewart played the honky tonks with his road band, The Honky Tonk Liberation Army, and recorded similar albums with modest success for RCA: 1976's ''Steppin' Out''; 1977's ''Your Place or Mine'' (which featured guest artists [[Nicolette Larson]], [[Emmylou Harris]], and [[Rodney Crowell]]); and 1978's ''[[Little Junior (album)|Little Junior]]''.

He was often labeled as \"too country\" for rock listeners and \"too rock\" for country fans. In 1980, he released the [[Chips Moman]]-produced ''[[Cactus and a Rose]]'' which featured Southern rockers [[Gregg Allman]], [[Dickey Betts]], [[Mike Lawler]], and [[Bonnie Bramlett]]. It did not garner much airplay and RCA teamed Stewart up with songwriter [[Dean Dillon]] for a pair of duet records. Soon after, Stewart returned to Florida, where alcoholism and drug use kept him from recording for much of the 1980s. His son, Gary Joseph Stewart, committed suicide late in the decade as well. Stewart signed with the [[HighTone Records|HighTone]] label in 1988 and recorded three albums over the next five years. These albums included fan favorites like the minor hit \"An Empty Glass (That's the Way the Day Ends)\" (written by Stewart and Dillon), \"Let's Go Jukin'\" (written by Stewart and Betts), and \"Brand New Whiskey\" (written by Stewart and his wife).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nStewart continued to tour through the 1990s, playing venues such as [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth's]] [[Billy Bob's Texas]] several times a year.<ref>{{cite web | title = Gary Stewart | work = Lone Star Music | url = http://www.lonestarmusic.com/index.php?file=a-artist&iArtistId=975 | access-date = 2008-02-13}}</ref> During this time, Bob Dylan, while touring with [[Tom Petty]] in Florida, drove out of his way to meet Stewart, \"confessing that he'd played Stewart's ode to marital malaise 'Ten Years of This' over and over, the record casting a spell over him.\"<ref name=\"auto\"/> In 2003, Stewart released ''Live at Billy Bob's Texas'', his first album in ten years and his first-ever live album.
