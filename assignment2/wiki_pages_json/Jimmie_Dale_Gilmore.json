In the 1950s, he was exposed to the emerging rock and roll of other Texans such as [[Roy Orbison]] and Lubbock native [[Buddy Holly]], as well as to [[Johnny Cash]] and [[Elvis Presley]], the latter two being in the line up at a concert he attended on October 15, 1955, at Lubbock's Fair Park Coliseum. He was profoundly influenced in the 1960s by [[The Beatles]] and [[Bob Dylan]] and the [[folk music]] and [[blues]] revival in that decade.\n\nWith [[Joe Ely]] and [[Butch Hancock]], Gilmore founded [[The Flatlanders]].<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> The group has been performing on and off since 1972. The band's first recording project, from the early 1970s, was barely distributed. It has since been acknowledged, through [[Rounder Records|Rounder]]'s 1990 reissue (''More a Legend Than a Band''), as a milestone of progressive, [[alternative country]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/> The three friends continued to reunite for occasional Flatlanders performances, and in May 2002, released a long-awaited follow-up album, ''Now Again,'' on [[New West Records]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nAfter briefly attending [[Texas Tech University]], Gilmore spent much of the 1970s in an [[ashram]] in [[Denver, Colorado]], studying [[metaphysics]] with teenaged Indian guru [[Prem Rawat]], also known as Maharaji. In the 1980s, he moved to [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], where his first solo album, ''[[Fair & Square (Jimmie Dale Gilmore album)|Fair & Square]]'', was released in 1988.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Country Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1993|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-726-6|page=161}}</ref>\n\nIn 1994, Gilmore teamed up with [[Willie Nelson]] to contribute \"Crazy\" to the AIDS benefit album ''[[Red Hot + Country]]'' produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]].\n\nGilmore appeared as himself in [[Peter Bogdanovich]]'s 1993 film ''[[The Thing Called Love]]'', a love story about young songwriters in Nashville. He also had a small but memorable acting role in the 1998 movie ''[[The Big Lebowski]]''. He portrayed a bowler named Smokey, an aging, emotionally \"fragile\" pacifist threatened with a pistol by Walter Sobchak, \"The Dude\" Lebowski's best friend and sidekick ([[John Goodman]]). He has also been a guest on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'', with host [[Jay Leno]], the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'', [[Garrison Keillor]]'s ''[[A Prairie Home Companion]]'' on [[NPR]], and the ''[[Fresh Air]]'' radio program with [[Terry Gross]]. Gilmore's son, [[Colin Gilmore]], is also a singer–songwriter based in Austin.\n\nGilmore's song \"Braver Newer World\" is featured in the 1995 [[Noah Baumbach]] film ''[[Kicking and Screaming (1995 film)|Kicking and Screaming]]''. In 2005, Gilmore released ''Come on Back'',<ref name=\"AMG\"/> an album of songs his father loved. Gilmore said of the album, \"This new album is a compilation of recordings of some old songs that my dad loved. I love them too, and it is a project very dear to me.\" His version of \"[[Mack the Knife]]\" from the album ''One Endless Night'' is on the soundtrack of [[Jacques Audiard]]'s 2009 film, ''[[A Prophet]]'' (Un Prophète).\n\nGilmore has been nominated for three Grammys, Best Contemporary Folk Album for ''Spinning Around The Sun'' in 1993, Best Contemporary Folk Album ''Braver Newer World'' in 1996, and Best Traditional Folk Album ''Come On Back'' in 2005.<ref>[https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/jimmie-dale-gilmore \"Recording Academy Grammy Awards\"], Grammy.com, Retrieved Feb. 14, 2018.</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n{{Main| Jimmie Dale Gilmore discography}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Biography}}\n*[[Music of Austin]]\n*[[Outlaw country]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* ''In the Country of Country: A Journey to the Roots of American Music'', Nicholas Dawidoff, Vintage Books, 1998. {{ISBN|0-679-41567-X}}.\n* ''Fire in the Water, Earth in the Air: Legends of West Texas Music'', Chris Oglesby, University of Texas Press, 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-292-71419-9}}.\n\n==External links==\n* [http://jimmiegilmore.com Jimmie Dale Gilmore's home page]\n* [http://thisibelieve.org/dsp_ShowEssay.php?uid=22084 \"This I Believe\" Essay by Jimmie Dale Gilmore]\n* {{IMDb name|0319541}}\n* {{AllMusic | id= jimmie-dale-gilmore-mn0000351935 | label= Jimmie Dale Gilmore}}\n* {{discogs artist|537413-Jimmie-Dale-Gilmore|Jimmie Dale Gilmore}}\n*[https://swco-ir.tdl.org/handle/10605/359203 Interview with Jimmie Dale Gilmore], on p.22, Kerrville Kronikle, Issue 4, 1989\n\n{{Jimmie Dale Gilmore}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gilmore, Jimmie Dale}}\n[[Category:1945 births]]\n[[Category:American country guitarists]]\n[[Category:American male guitarists]]\n[[Category:American country singer-songwriters]]\n[[Category:American male singer-songwriters]]\n[[Category:Record producers from Texas]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Singers from Austin, Texas]]\n[[Category:Musicians from Amarillo, Texas]]\n[[Category:Musicians from Lubbock, Texas]]\n[[Category:Progressive country musicians]]\n[[Category:Texas Tech University alumni]]\n[[Category:Singer-songwriters from Texas]]\n[[Category:Guitarists from Texas]]\n[[Category:20th-century American guitarists]]\n[[Category:Country musicians from Texas]]\n[[Category:20th-century American male musicians]]"
