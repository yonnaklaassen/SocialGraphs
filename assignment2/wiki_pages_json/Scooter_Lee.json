There, she was labeled as 'the little lady with the big voice'; recording country blues for the label. She soon settled in on recording country music with a blues overtone.\n\nDuring the 1970s, Scooter Lee toured alongside major artists, including [[Linda Ronstadt]], [[Kris Kristofferson]], [[Tammy Wynette]] and [[Johnny Cash|Johnny]] & [[June Carter Cash]]. In the 1980s, Scooter Lee gained ground with her 5 piece band sponsored by the [[RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company]], working 10 months a year at every major state fair and other regional festivals. Performing 2-3 shows daily, 300 dates a year, taught her the art of fully commanding a stage. Spotted in Los Angeles in 1985, Scooter Lee was invited to join the [[Bob Hope]] [[United Service Organizations|USO Tours]] and gained experience on stages in war-torn countries.\n\nScooter Lee grabbed the attention of the country music dance community during the early 1990s when she was signed to [[Sony Records]] to follow in the footsteps of [[Billy Ray Cyrus]], [[Brooks & Dunn]], [[Tracy Byrd]] and [[Reba McEntire]] just as the '[[line dance]]' phenomenon emerged. She developed and perfected the formula of writing & recording a perfectly phrased song that was not only 'dancer friendly' but 'radio friendly' as well.<ref>{{cite web|title=Scooter Lee Biography|url=http://stompede.com/scooter_lee.html|website=Sundance Stompede|accessdate=4 April 2015}}</ref> Some of her most successful singles include J'ai du Boogie, Dizzy, Rose Garden, High-Test Love, Ribbon Of Highway, Roll Back The Rug, Honky Tonk Twist, OeeOeeO, Rock & Roll Waltz, Rompin' Stompin', Louisiana Hot Sauce, This Little Light Of Mine, Splish Splash and Break Away.\n\nIn [[Nashville, TN]], Scooter Lee is considered one of the hardest working artist on the road, performing more than 175 days a year worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hanson|first1=Eric|title=Recording Artist Scooter Lee to Perform at San Francisco Gay Rodeo & Festival|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2006/08/prweb427854.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925045603/http://www.prweb.com/releases/2006/08/prweb427854.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 25, 2008|website=PRWeb|accessdate=4 April 2015|location=San Francisco, CA|date=August 23, 2006}}</ref> She tours 27 countries, including: the USA, England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland, Denmark, France, Belgium, Netherlands, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Malaysia, Sweden, Japan, Canada, Finland, Norway, Germany, Switzerland and Belgium.\n\nCurrently, Scooter Lee resides in [[Atlanta, Georgia]] where she owns and operates her international distribution company for audio and video as well as founding a senior health [[501(c) organization|501(c)(3) charity organization]] that uses line dance as its chosen form of exercise.
