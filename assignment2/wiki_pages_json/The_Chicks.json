The band consists of [[Natalie Maines]] (lead vocals, guitar, bass guitar) and sisters [[Martie Maguire]] (vocals, fiddle, [[mandolin]], guitar) and [[Emily Strayer]] (vocals, guitar, banjo, [[Dobro]]). Maguire and Strayer, both née Erwin, founded the band in 1989, with bassist Laura Lynch and vocalist and guitarist Robin Lynn Macy. They performed [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] and [[country music]], [[busking]] and touring the bluegrass festival circuits and small venues for six years without attracting a [[major label]]. In 1992, Lynch replaced Macy as the lead vocalist.\n\nAfter releasing three independent albums, the Dixie Chicks signed to [[Monument Records|Monument Records Nashville]] in 1997, by which point Maines had joined. They achieved success with their albums ''[[Wide Open Spaces (album)|Wide Open Spaces]]'' (1998) and ''[[Fly (Dixie Chicks album)|Fly]]'' (1999). After Monument closed its Nashville branch, the Dixie Chicks moved to [[Columbia Records]] for ''[[Home (Dixie Chicks album)|Home]]'' (2002). These albums achieved [[multi-platinum]] sales in the United States, Canada, and Australia, along with several charting singles on the American ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts. Their successful US singles were \"[[There's Your Trouble]]\", \"[[Wide Open Spaces (song)|Wide Open Spaces]]\", \"[[You Were Mine]]\", \"[[Cowboy Take Me Away]]\", \"[[Without You (Dixie Chicks song)|Without You]]\", and a cover of [[Bruce Robison]]'s \"[[Travelin' Soldier]]\". The Dixie Chicks also reached number one on the [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]] chart with their 2002 cover of [[Fleetwood Mac]]'s \"[[Landslide (Fleetwood Mac song)|Landslide]]\".\n\nDays before the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], Maines [[Dixie Chicks comments on George W. Bush|told a London audience that the Dixie Chicks did not endorse the war]] and were ashamed of US President [[George W. Bush]] being from Texas. The remarks triggered boycotts in the US and a backlash from fans. After a hiatus, the Dixie Chicks recorded ''[[Taking the Long Way]]'' in 2006, an album informed by the backlash. \"[[Not Ready to Make Nice]]\" became their biggest crossover single, reaching number four on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. After a second hiatus, Maguire and Strayer recorded as a duo called [[Court Yard Hounds]]. The Dixie Chicks reunited to tour in the 2010s. In 2020, they removed \"[[Dixie]]\" from their name due to negative connotations, and released their first album in 14 years, ''[[Gaslighter (album)|Gaslighter]].''\n\nThe Chicks have won 13 [[Grammy Award]]s, including five in 2007 for ''Taking the Long Way,'' which received the [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]], and its single \"[[Not Ready to Make Nice]]\", which received the [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year]] and the [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year]].
