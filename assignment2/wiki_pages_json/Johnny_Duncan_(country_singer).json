In his career, he released 14 studio albums, including thirteen on [[Columbia Records]]. These albums produced more than 30 chart singles, with three of those reaching number one: \"[[Thinkin' of a Rendezvous]]\", \"[[It Couldn't Have Been Any Better]]\", and \"[[She Can Put Her Shoes Under my Bed (Anytime)]]\" from 1976, 1977, and 1978, respectively. Seven more of his singles were top-10 hits.\n\n==Biography==\nDuncan was born in [[Dublin, Texas]], United States.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Country Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1993|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-726-6|pages=125/6}}</ref> Before he went to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], Duncan attended [[Texas Christian University]] in [[Fort Worth, Texas]]. He then spent a few years in [[Clovis, New Mexico]].<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/>\n\n===Early life and influences===\nDuncan's early life was steeped in West Texas music. He picked this up naturally as a boy listening to his mother play rhythm guitar in his uncle's country band. Later, he began sharpening his vocal skills, influenced by his early idols [[Eddy Arnold]], [[Perry Como]], [[Jim Reeves]], and [[Frank Sinatra]]. He was born into a musical family. He was proud of his talented cousins, including Eddie Seals, [[Jimmy Seals]] of [[Seals & Crofts]], and country singer [[Dan Seals]].<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> \"He knew when he was 12 years old that playing music and singing songs was going to be his life\", said his wife, Connie Duncan.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/latestnews/stories/081606glduncanobit.24cdeed.html |title= Country singer Johnny Duncan dies |newspaper=[[The Dallas Morning News]] |date=August 15, 2006}}</ref>\n\n\"He grew up here in a small country town and loved music\", Jim Harrell said. \"His mother played herself and a lot of his cousins played with him.\" (Jim Harrell, owner and funeral director of Harrell Funeral Home in Dublin, which handled arrangements for his funeral)\n\nAfter playing and singing with his musically gifted family for a few years, he auditioned demos in April 1959 for [[Norman Petty]] in Clovis.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> Petty recognized his talent as a gifted songwriter, and Duncan was signed to Leader Records, a subsidiary of the Kapp Records label. After three US singles and one UK release between 1959 and 1962 saw little action, Duncan grew tired of the intent to market him as a pop vocalist, and he decided to pursue the country genre and moved to Nashville.\n\nDuncan wrote many songs recorded by artists such as [[Charley Pride]], [[Marty Robbins]], [[Chet Atkins]], [[Conway Twitty]], and [[Jim Ed Brown]].\n\n===Career===\nIn [[Franklin, Tennessee]], Duncan worked as a DJ and performed on local morning TV shows.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> He began to record for [[Columbia Records]] in the late 1960s.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> Between 1967 and 1973, Duncan's recordings never reached the top 20 until \"Sweet Country Woman\" entered at number six.\n\nIn the 1970s, Duncan performed duets with [[Janie Fricke]], many of which were successful. Their songs \"Stranger\" and \"Thinking of a Rendezvous\" (both 1976), \"It Couldn't Have Been Any Better\" (1977), and \"Come A Little Bit Closer\" (1978, a remake of the song first made popular by [[Jay and the Americans]]) were the most successful.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> \"Thinking of a Rendezvous\" and \"It Couldn't Have Been Any Better\" both went to No. 1 on the ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs|Hot Country Singles]] chart, as did Duncan's solo 1978 single \"She Can Put Her Shoes Under My Bed Anytime\".<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/>\n\nDuncan's string of top-10 hits continued into 1979 – most notably a cover of [[Johnny Rivers]]' \"Swayin' to the Music\" (released by Duncan as \"Slow Dancing\")<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> and \"The Lady in the Blue Mercedes\" – and he even enjoyed another top-20 hit with Fricke in 1980 with a duet version of [[Michael Jackson]]'s \"[[She's Out of My Life]]\". His star power faded in the early 1980s with changing musical tastes, although his biggest songs were popular on country radio through the late 1980s and early 1990s.\n\n===Personal life and death===\nDuncan died of a heart attack on August 14, 2006, at the age of 67. Duncan has three daughters: Angela, Lezlie and Lori with his first wife, Betty Deisher,<ref name=\"AMG\">[{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p1593/biography|pure_url=yes}} Johnny Duncan] at [[AllMusic]]</ref> and his son John “Ike” Duncan with wife Connie Duncan, who survived him.\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Year\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Album\n! colspan=\"2\"| Chart Positions\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Label\n|-\n! width=\"50\"| <small>[[Top Country Albums|US Country]]</small>\n! width=\"50\"| <small>CAN Country</small>\n|-\n| 1968\n| ''Johnny One Time''\n| align=\"center\"| 40\n| align=\"center\"| —\n| rowspan=\"4\"| Columbia\n|-\n| 1969\n| ''Back to Back'' <small>(w/ June Stearns)</small>\n| align=\"center\"| —\n| align=\"center\"| —\n|-\n| 1971\n| ''There's Something About a Lady''\n| align=\"center\"| —\n| align=\"center\"| —\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 1973\n| ''Sweet Country Woman''\n| align=\"center\"| 34\n| align=\"center\"| —\n|-\n| ''You're Gonna Need a Man''\n| align=\"center\"| —\n| align=\"center\"| —\n| Harmony\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 1977\n| ''Johnny Duncan''\n| align=\"center\"| 21\n| align=\"center\"| —\n| rowspan=\"8\"| Columbia\n|-\n| ''Come a Little Bit Closer''\n| align=\"center\"| 27\n| align=\"center\"| —\n|-\n| 1978\n| ''The Best Is Yet to Come''\n| align=\"center\"| 42\n| align=\"center\"| 8\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 1979\n| ''See You When the Sun Goes Down''\n| align=\"center\"| —\n| align=\"center\"| —\n|-\n| ''Straight from Texas''\n| align=\"center\"| —\n| align=\"center\"| —\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\"| 1980\n| ''In My Dreams''\n| align=\"center\"| 61\n| align=\"center\"| —\n|-\n| ''[[Nice 'n' Easy (Johnny Duncan and Janie Fricke album)|Nice 'n' Easy]]'' <small>(w/ [[Janie Fricke]])</small>\n| align=\"center\"| —\n| align=\"center\"| —\n|-\n| ''You're on My Mind''\n| align=\"center\"| —\n| align=\"center\"| —\n|-\n| 1986\n| ''Faraway Hideaway''\n| align=\"center\"| —\n| align=\"center\"| —\n| Pharaoh\n|-\n| 2005\n| ''The Thing To Do''\n| align=\"center\"| —\n| align=\"center\"| —\n| JRD Records\n|}\n\n===Compilation albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
