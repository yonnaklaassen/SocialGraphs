News reports conflict on the subject of where she lives.\n\n== Early life ==\nGentry was born Roberta Lee Streeter on July 27, 1942, near [[Woodland, Mississippi|Woodland]] in [[Chickasaw County, Mississippi]], to Ruby Lee (née Shipman; November 28, 1920 – April 2, 1989)<ref>{{cite news |title=Clipping from Reno Gazette-Journal |newspaper=Reno Gazette-Journal |date=April 4, 1989 |page=22 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/5582969/reno_gazettejournal/ |via=Newspapers.com |access-date=September 11, 2018}}</ref> and Robert Harrison Streeter. When her parents divorced shortly after her birth, her mother moved to California, leaving Gentry to be raised on a farm by her paternal grandparents. She grew up without electricity or plumbing. Her grandmother traded one of the family's milk cows for a neighbor's piano, and, at age seven, Gentry composed her first song, \"My Dog Sergeant Is a Good Dog\". Gentry lived in [[Greenwood, Mississippi]], with her father for a few years and learned to play the guitar and banjo.\n\nAt age 13, Gentry moved to [[Palm Springs, California]], to live with her then-remarried mother. They performed as a duo, Ruby and Bobbie Meyers, for a short time. Gentry took her stage name from the 1952 film ''[[Ruby Gentry]],'' which she had seen on television. In the film, Ruby (played by [[Jennifer Jones]]) was a poor but beautiful girl from the backwoods, who ended up marrying the town tycoon.\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Gentry moved to Los Angeles to enter [[UCLA]] as a philosophy major. She supported herself with clerical jobs, occasionally performing at nightclubs and country clubs, and when she appeared in a revue at Les Folies Bergeres nightclub in [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]], [[Bob Hope]] encouraged her to keep performing. She worked as a fashion model, and on June 29, 1962, [[United Press International]] circulated a [[wire photo]] of Gentry that included [[Cheryl Crane]], daughter of [[Lana Turner]].<ref>[http://333sound.com/2014/12/03/bobbie-gentry-week-day-3-behind-the-photograph-of-bobbie-gentry-and-cheryl-crane/ Photo dated 6/29/1962] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218193927/http://333sound.com/2014/12/03/bobbie-gentry-week-day-3-behind-the-photograph-of-bobbie-gentry-and-cheryl-crane/ |date=December 18, 2014 }}, [[United Press International]] (photographer uncredited). Reproduced on 333sound.com, December 3, 2014. Retrieved December 18, 2014</ref> Gentry transferred to the [[Los Angeles Conservatory of Music]], where she took classes in composition, music theory and arranging. While attending a [[Jody Reynolds]] concert at a club in Palm Springs in 1966, Gentry asked if she could sit in on one of Reynolds' recording sessions. This led to an invitation to sing on two duets with Reynolds: \"Stranger in the Mirror\" and \"Requiem for Love\". The two songs were released in September 1966 by Titan Records, but failed to chart.\n\n==Career==\n===1967: Debut===\nGentry recorded a demo at Whitney Recording Studio in Glendale, California, in February and March 1967. Her sole ambition originally was to write songs to sell to other artists, telling ''[[The Washington Post]]'' that she only sang on the recording of \"Ode to Billie Joe\" that she took to Capitol because it was cheaper than hiring someone to sing it.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Murtha |first1=Tara |title=Ode to Billie Joe |date=2015 |publisher=Blumsbury |location=New York |isbn=978-1-6235-6964-8 |page=58}}</ref>\n\nGentry signed with Capitol Records on June 23, 1967, where staff producer [[Kelly Gordon]] would produce ''[[Ode to Billie Joe (album)|Ode to Billie Joe]]'' as his first full-length album for the label. But it was \"Mississippi Delta\", intended as the A-side of her first single, that initially got Gentry signed. Her original demo of \"Mississippi Delta\" was the version issued, but \"Ode to Billie Joe\" acquired a string arrangement by [[Jimmie Haskell]], dubbed onto the original recording at Capitol. The day after the string session, Capitol's A&R team decided to make \"Ode to Billie Joe\" the A-side.<ref name=\"Ode To Billie Joe – Bobbie Gentry\">{{cite web |title=Ode To Billie Joe – Bobbie Gentry |url=http://bobbiegentry.org.uk/discography/ode-to-billie-joe/ |website=bobbiegentry.org.uk |access-date=June 12, 2018}}</ref> The single was released on July 10, 1967. It would spend four weeks at number one on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot 100]] and, on the year-end chart, place number three. The single reached number eight on the ''Billboard'' Black Singles chart and number 13 on the UK Top 40.<ref name=everyhit /> It sold more than 3,000,000 copies worldwide.<ref name=am /> In 2001, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine listed \"Ode to Billie Joe\" among ''[[the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]]''.\n\nFollowing the single's success, the producers quickly assembled the rest of the album from the 12 demos Gentry had recorded, completing overdubs in a matter of days. The result was a unique combination of blues, folk, and jazz elements that rounded out Gentry's recollections of her home, coming across more as a concept album than a hastily assembled collection of songs. Capitol pre-ordered 500,000 copies—the largest pressing of a debut album in the label's prior history. The album hit stores within a month of pressing, on August 21.<ref name=\"Ode To Billie Joe – Bobbie Gentry\"/> ''Ode to Billie Joe'' replaced [[the Beatles]]' ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' at the top of the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and reached No.&nbsp;5 on the ''Billboard'' Black Albums chart. Gentry won three [[Grammy Awards]] in 1967, including ''Best New Artist'' and ''Best Female Pop Vocal Performance''. She was also named the [[Academy of Country Music]]'s Most Promising Female Vocalist.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.acmcountry.com/winners|title=ACM Winners – Academy of Country Music|author=BubbleUp, LTD.|work=Academy of Country Music}}</ref>\n\n===1968: ''The Delta Sweete'', ''Local Gentry'' and Glen Campbell===\nIn February 1968, Gentry took part in the [[Festival della canzone italiana|Italian Song Festival in Sanremo]] competition, as one of two performers of \"La Siepe\" by [[Vito Pallavicini]] and Massara. Capitol released the song concurrently as a single, backed by another Italian tune also recorded by Gentry, \"La Città è Grande\" by Pallavicini and De Ponti.<ref>{{cite web |title=La Siepe (The Hedge) – Bobbie Gentry |url=http://bobbiegentry.org.uk/discography/la-siepe/ |website=bobbiegentry.org.uk |access-date=February 10, 2020}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bobbie Gentry in 1968.jpg|thumb|upright|Gentry in 1968]]\nGentry's second album, ''[[The Delta Sweete]]'', was released in February 1968. In its musical ambition, the album represented a decisive step beyond her debut. This concept album drew inspiration from Gentry's Mississippi Delta roots. Most of its sound comes from Gentry, who played almost every instrument on its tracks, including piano, guitar, banjo, bass, and vibes. Nonetheless, Capitol's Kelly Gordon, producer of Gentry's first work for the label, also received the entire producing credit for ''The Delta Sweete.'' The album earned Gentry two more entries on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. \"Okolona River Bottom Band\" peaked at number 54, while her cover of \"Louisiana Man\" made it to number 100. Although the album failed to match the success of its predecessor, only reaching number 132 on the ''Billboard'' 200, critics have called it one of the unacclaimed masterpieces of the 1960s.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Delta Sweete – Bobbie Gentry |url=http://bobbiegentry.org.uk/discography/the-delta-sweete/ |website=bobbiegentry.org.uk/ |access-date=February 10, 2020}}</ref>\n\nFollowing ''The Delta Sweete'', Capitol released Gentry's third album, ''[[Local Gentry]]'', in August 1968. It failed to appear on any of the ''Billboard'' album charts, but did peak at number 83 on the ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]]'' Top 100 Albums chart.<ref>{{cite web |title=Local Gentry – Bobbie Gentry |url=http://bobbiegentry.org.uk/discography/local-gentry/ |website=bobbiegentry.org.uk/ |access-date=February 10, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn September, one month after the release of ''Local Gentry,'' the artist's third album of 1968 came out. ''[[Bobbie Gentry and Glen Campbell]]'' features duets with label mate [[Glen Campbell]]. Their chemistry made the partnership a great success. The album peaked at number 11 on the ''Billboard'' [[Billboard 200|Top LP's]] chart and number one on the [[Top Country Albums|Top Country LP's]] chart. It was also certified Gold by the RIAA and earned Gentry and Campbell the [[Academy of Country Music]] award for Album of the Year.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bobbie Gentry and Glen Campbell – Bobbie Gentry |url=http://bobbiegentry.org.uk/discography/bobbie-gentry-and-glen-campbell/ |website=bobbiegentry.org.uk |access-date=February 10, 2020}}</ref> Gentry was also nominated for Top Female Vocalist.\n\n===''Bobbie Gentry'' (TV series)===\nIn 1968, Gentry was invited to host her own variety show on [[BBC Two]] in the UK, making her the first female songwriter to front a series on the channel. The initial six episodes of ''Bobbie Gentry'' were broadcast weekly from July 13 to August 17, 1968. It featured musicians from the Mississippi countryside, as well as guests such as [[Donovan]], [[the Hollies]], [[Glen Campbell]], [[James Taylor]], [[Randy Newman]], [[Elton John]], [[Alan Price]], [[Billy Preston]], and [[Pan's People]]. Two further, six-episode series were broadcast from June 18 to July 23 1969; and February 1 to March 15, 1971.\n\nThe series was produced and directed by [[Stanley Dorfman]], who was engaged to be married to Gentry in 1970,<ref name=\":0\" /> and credited Gentry as his co-director. Dorfman told author Tara Murtha, \"After a few episodes, she was pretty much co-directing the show because she had such great ideas. [But] the BBC wouldn't have it, wouldn't have an artist credited as a director or producer, so the credit went to me as producer and director. But she definitely contributed as much as I did creatively to the show. She was just full of ideas.\"<ref name=\"UKBio\">{{cite web |title=Biography – Bobbie Gentry |url=http://bobbiegentry.org.uk/biography/ |access-date=February 14, 2020 |website=bobbiegentry.org.uk}}</ref> [[John Cameron (musician)|John Cameron]], the [[Music Arranger|music arranger]] for her BBC shows noted, \"She was pretty much the alpha female in the group – [producer] Stanley Dorfman's assistant Kate and choreographer [[Flick Colby]] were the only other prominent females in the crew.

These included a one-hour special for the ''[[In Concert (British TV series)|In Concert]]'' series, broadcast on October 30, 1970; and Glen Campbell's own BBC Two special, broadcast May 6, 1970.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/search/0/20?order=first&filt=is_tv&q=%22Bobbie+Gentry%22#top|title=Bobbie Gentry|website=[[BBC Genome Project|BBC Genome]]|date=4 June 2024}}</ref>\n\n===1969: ''Touch 'Em with Love''===\nGentry's fifth album, ''[[Touch 'Em with Love]]'', came out in July 1969. It marked a transition in her career: In an attempt to re-brand Gentry as a blue-eyed soul singer, it featured fewer self-penned regional songs and more systematically chosen cover songs. Recorded in Nashville and produced by Kelso Herston, the album's 10 tracks included only two originals. The title track was released as the first single, but it failed to go above number 113 on ''Billboard'''s [[Bubbling Under the Hot 100]] chart and only reached number 164 on the ''Billboard'' 200. Gentry's cover of \"[[I'll Never Fall in Love Again]]\" was released as the second single in the UK, where it became a number one hit on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. The album reached number 21 on the [[UK Albums Chart]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Touch 'Em with Love – Bobbie Gentry |url=http://bobbiegentry.org.uk/discography/touch-em-with-love/ |website=bobbiegentry.org.uk |access-date=February 11, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 1969, Gentry taped four television specials for Canadian television station [[CFTO-DT|CFTO-TV]] [[Toronto]] for North American syndication.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/43253837/|title=The Ottawa Journal from Ottawa, · Page 82|date=May 30, 1970 |via=Newspapers.com|access-date=October 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===1970: ''Fancy''===\nApril 1970 saw the release of ''[[Fancy (Bobbie Gentry album)|Fancy]]'', Gentry's sixth album in three years. Like 1969's ''Touch 'Em with Love'', it contains only covers, except for the artist's self-penned title track. Most of the album was recorded at [[FAME Studios|Fame Recording Studios]] in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, with producer [[Rick Hall]]. \"[[Fancy (Bobbie Gentry song)|Fancy]]\", released as the album's first single, became Gentry's biggest hit since \"Ode to Billie Joe\", peaking within the top 40 in the US, Canada, and Australia. Of the song Gentry herself said, \"Fancy is my strongest statement for women's lib, if you really listen to it. I agree wholeheartedly with that movement and all the serious issues that [it stands] for—equality, equal pay, day care centers, and abortion rights,\" she explained to ''[[After Dark (magazine)|After Dark]]'' magazine in 1974.<ref>{{cite web |title=Fancy – Bobbie Gentry |url=http://bobbiegentry.org.uk/discography/fancy/ |website=bobbiegentry.org.uk |access-date=February 11, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe album's first European single, a cover of \"[[Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head]]\", peaked at number 40. The album's second North American single, \"He Made a Woman Out of Me\", did not reach the same heights as \"Fancy\", reaching only number 71 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100.\n\nGentry would be nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance|Best Contemporary Vocal Performance, Female]] at the [[13th Annual Grammy Awards]].\n\n===1971–1974: ''Patchwork'' and departure from Capitol===\n[[File:Patchwork - Billboard ad 1971.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' advertisement, May 8, 1971]]\n\nGentry released ''[[Patchwork (Bobbie Gentry album)|Patchwork]]'' in April 1971. It has been described as a collection of short stories in song, ranging from country and pop to blues, stitched together with cinematic interludes to form a cohesive whole. ''Patchwork'' was Gentry's first entirely self-written and -produced album. Its first single: \"But I Can't Get Back\", was a small hit, peaking at number 37 on the ''Billboard'' [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Top 40 Easy Listening]] chart and number 93 in Canada.<ref>{{cite web |title=Patchwork – Bobbie Gentry |url=http://bobbiegentry.org.uk/discography/patchwork/ |website=bobbiegentry.org.uk |access-date=February 10, 2020}}</ref> Gentry would release one more single for Capitol in August 1972, \"The Girl from Cincinnati\".\n\nAround the time ''Patchwork'' was released, the entire executive board that had been at Capitol throughout Gentry's career was fired. A major restructuring at Capitol took place as parent company EMI tried to seize back control and rekindle the label's dwindling profits. This saw the artist roster slashed from 247 to 81 alongside extensive cuts to production and marketing budgets. With none of the executive board left that had known and worked with her, negotiations stalled over the renewal terms of Gentry's contract, and this failure to reach an agreement with Capitol created a stalemate. Since Gentry was unwilling to release an album with Capitol on the terms offered, she found herself unable to release an album on another label, meaning she was left with no choice but to wait out the remaining option period of her contract.\n\nIn 1974, she hosted a summer replacement variety show on [[CBS]] called ''The Bobbie Gentry Happiness Hour''. The show, which was her version of Glen Campbell's hit series ''[[The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour]]'', was not renewed for a full season.\n\n===1975–1977: Post-Capitol recordings===\nIn 1975, Gentry wrote and performed \"Another Place, Another Time\" for writer-director [[Max Baer, Jr.]]'s film ''[[Macon County Line]]''. Following the film's success the song was released on a promotional [[7-inch single]]. In 1976, Baer directed the feature film ''[[Ode to Billy Joe (film)|Ode to Billy Joe]]'', based on Gentry's hit song and starring [[Robby Benson]] and [[Glynnis O'Connor]]. In the movie, the mystery of the title character's suicide is revealed as a part of the conflict between his love for Bobbie Lee Hartley and a drunken homosexual experience.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/ode-to-billy-joe-1976|title=Ode to Billy Joe movie review (1976) &#124; Roger Ebert|first=Roger|last=Ebert|website=Rogerebert.com|access-date=October 11, 2019}}</ref> [[Warner Bros. Records]] released a soundtrack of the score by Michel Legrand, including a re-recorded version of \"Ode to Billie Joe\", re-titled \"Ode to Billy Joe\" to match the film's title, with Gentry stating that the original spelling was an error. Warner Bros. released the new version as a single and Capitol re-released the original version, which gave Gentry two concurrent chart placings with the same song. The re-recording would go on to be Gentry's last single to chart, meaning that her first and last chart entries are the same song.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ode to Billy Joe (Soundtrack re-recording) – Bobbie Gentry |url=http://bobbiegentry.org.uk/discography/ode-to-billy-joe-soundtrack-re-recording/ |website=bobbiegentry.org.uk |access-date=February 11, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 1977 Gentry reunited with producer Rick Hall in Muscle Shoals to record an album for the [[Curb Records]] division of Warner Bros. Records (unlike Gentry's 1969 ''Fancy'' album, Gentry's 1977 recording sessions with Hall were not at his FAME Studios but at the nearby Music Mill Studio). After an advance single: \"[[Steal Away (Jimmy Hughes song)|Steal Away]]\", had an unsuccessful February 1978 release, the album was shelved. \"Steal Away\" - a remake of the 1964 [[Jimmy Hughes (singer)|Jimmy Hughes]] hit which had inaugurated FAME Studios’ hit streak - had as its B-side: the [[Patti Dahlstrom]] composition \"He Did Me Wrong, But He Did It Right\": these tracks plus three additional tracks from Gentry's 1977 recording sessions: \"Slow Cookin'\" (written by Abby Marable), \"Sweet Country\" (written by Gentry), and \"Thunder in the Afternoon\" (written by [[Mac Davis]], Rita Grimm and Yvonne Norman), would be released on the 1992 European compilation album ''Ode to Billie Joe''.\n\n===1978–1982: Final  projects before retirement===\nGentry appeared as a guest on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' on Christmas Day 1978. She attended the Best of Vegas Awards on March 21, 1980.\n\nOn May 10, 1981, Gentry was one of many celebrity guests to take part in ''An All-Star Salute to Mother's Day''. During the television special she performed \"Mama, a Rainbow\" from the musical ''[[Minnie's Boys]]'' for her mother who was seated in the audience. This would prove to be Gentry's final public performance.\n\nThe last time Gentry appeared in public was when she attended the [[Academy of Country Music Awards]] on April 30, 1982.
