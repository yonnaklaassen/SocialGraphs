They earned national recognition and a guest spot on [[Ernest Tubb]]'s radio show for their humorous song \"Looking Back To See\", which hit the top ten and stayed on the charts through the summer of 1954.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web | url = http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/browns/bio.jhtml | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20040604024139/http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/browns/bio.jhtml | url-status = dead | archive-date = June 4, 2004 | title = The Browns Biography | publisher = Country Music Television, Inc. |author1=Brennan, Sandra |author2=Manheim, James| access-date = March 24, 2009}}</ref>\n\n===The Browns===\nJim Ed and Maxine were joined in 1955 by 18-year-old Bonnie, and The Browns began performing on ''[[Louisiana Hayride]]'' in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]].
