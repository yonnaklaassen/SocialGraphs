The band, which is based in Tallahassee, Florida, consists of lead singer and songwriter Eric Durrance, lead guitarist Ben Castro, bass player Dale Shumate and drummer Joe Markham.\n\n==History==\nTobacco Rd Band was founded in 2010 by Eric Durrance, who had previously been the lead singer with the acclaimed Christian rock band [[Big Dismal]], which ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' once named one of \"Five Christian Bands on the Rise.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.strummagazine.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=49:eric&catid=34:music |accessdate=2013-09-17 |title=VUGA Enterprises Media Group }}</ref>\n\nAfter Big Dismal broke up, Durrance began performing solo, and was selected to tour with [[Jason Aldean]] and [[Lady Antebellum]] as part of [[Country Music Television]]'s \"CMT on Tour\" in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|title=Eric Durrance To Open CMT ON TOUR 2008|url=http://www.countryhound.com/Eric-Durrance-To-Open-CMT-ON-TOUR-2008|publisher=Countryhound.com|accessdate=17 January 2015}}</ref>  Durrance later formed TRB with his friend, lead guitarist Lex Vance. With its hard-driving sound coupled with Durrance's reputation from his years with Big Dismal, TRB quickly amassed a fan base throughout the South.\n\nIn early 2012, TRB released its debut EP titled \"Where the Girls Are,\" which consisted of six tracks: \"Where the Girls Are,\" \"Jesus & Guns,\" \"All About Me Today,\" \"There's No Such Thing as Goodbye\" and \"Dear Life.\" Shortly thereafter, the band released the single \"That's Country,\" featuring a guest performance by [[Colt Ford]], who also appears in the accompanying music video.<ref>{{cite web|title=615 Spotlight: Tobacco Rd Band Team Up With Colt Ford on 'That's Country'|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-615/1538509/615-spotlight-tobacco-rd-band-team-up-with-colt-ford-on-thats|publisher=Billboard.com|accessdate=17 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 2013, Durrance became the first artist to sign with Silvercreek Records, a new label in Nashville, which was founded by two Nashville music industry veterans—songwriter Stafond Seago and songwriter, producer and plugger Steve Pope.<ref>{{cite web|title=Silvercreek Records Opens on Music Row|date=13 August 2013 |url=http://www.musicrow.com/2013/08/silvercreek-records-opens-on-music-row/|publisher=Musicrow.com|accessdate=17 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Nashville Business Journal|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/nashville/news/2013/08/13/silvercreek-records-label-launches-on.html|publisher=Bizjournals.com|accessdate=17 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicnewsnashville.com/eric-durrance-and-tobacco-rd-band-sign-with-silvercreek-records|title=Eric Durrance and Tobacco Rd Band Sign with Silvercreek Records|work=Music News Nashville|accessdate=17 January 2015}}</ref> However, due to creative differences, Durrance negotiated a severance from Silvercreek and resumed recording under his own independent label, Big Southern Entertainment.\n\nDurrance and Tobacco Rd Band continued writing songs and performing to sell-out crowds, primarily in the South, throughout 2014 and 2015.\n\nIn January 2016, Tobacco Rd Band released their song \"Jesus & Guns\" to country radio stations in response to President [[Barack Obama]]'s executive action on gun control. The pro-[[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] ballad, which advocates the use of guns to protect one's family, had previously appeared on the band's 2012 album \"Where the Girls Are.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Tobacco Rd Band Releases JESUS & GUNS to Radio|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwmusic/article/Tobacco-Rd-Band-Releases-JESUS-GUNS-to-Radio-20160115|publisher=Broadway World|accessdate=21 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Members==\n*Eric Durrance - Lead Vocals / Guitar\n*Ben Castro - Lead Guitar\n*Dale Shumate - Bass Guitar\n*Joe Markham - Drums\n\n==Discography==\n*Where the Girls Are (EP) -  Released: January 6, 2012, Big Southern Entertainment\n\n==Track listing==\n{{tracklist   \n| title1          = Where the Girls Are | length1         = 3:11\n| title2          = Jesus & Guns| length2         = 4:07\n| title3          = Energy Craze | length3         = 2:56\n| title4          = All About Me Today| length4         = 3:40\n| title5          = There's No Such Thing As Goodbye| length5         = 3:46\n| title6          = Dear Life | length6         = 3:09\n}}\n\n*That's Country (single) ft.
