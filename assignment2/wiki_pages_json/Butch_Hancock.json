Hancock continued to write songs and in 1978 he founded a recording company, Rainlight Records and released his first solo album, ''West Texas Waltzes and Dust-Blown Tractor Tunes.''<ref name=\"LarkinGE\" /> He continued to bring out albums with folk tunes, first with only guitar and harmonica and subsequently with expanded use of instruments and arrangements. From the late 1990s he has reappeared with the Flatlanders, with whom he was to release a series of albums in 2004.\n\nHancock lived in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], a place congenial to his [[progressive country]] style, for a couple of decades until he moved to the ghosttown region of [[Terlingua]], Texas in the 1990s, preferring more rural environs.\n\n== Music ==\nButch Hancock has been called \"one of the finest songwriters of our time\"<ref>Steve Pick: [https://web.archive.org/web/20010411064828/http://www.geocities.com/Nashville/1928/pick2.html  Butch Hancock Bests Them All With Exquisite Lyrics, Melodies] ''St. Louis Post-Dispatch'' November 27, 1994.</ref> and is acknowledged by his peers as one of the premier Texas singer-songwriters.<ref name=Buchholz /> His lyrics are ingenious, excelling in metaphor and irony and displaying a world-weary trait, just as he is a master of seeing the miracle in the ordinary.
