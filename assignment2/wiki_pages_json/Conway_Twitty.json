Initially a part of the 1950s [[rockabilly]] scene, Twitty was best known as a [[country music]] performer. From 1971 to 1976, Twitty received a string of [[Country Music Association]] awards for duets with [[Loretta Lynn]]. He was inducted into both the [[Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum|Country Music]] and [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame|Rockabilly]] Halls of Fame.\n\nTwitty was known for his frequent use of romantic and sentimental themes in his songs. Due to his following being compared to a religious revival, comedian [[Jerry Clower]] nicknamed Twitty \"The High Priest of Country Music\", the eventual title of [[The High Priest of Country Music|his 33rd studio album]]. Twitty achieved stardom with hit songs like \"[[Hello Darlin' (song)|Hello Darlin']]\", \"[[You've Never Been This Far Before]]\" and \"[[Linda on My Mind (song)|Linda on My Mind]]\". Twitty topped ''[[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']]''{{'s}} [[Hot Country Songs]] chart 40 times in his career, a record that stood for two decades until it was surpassed by [[George Strait]], and topped the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart once with \"It's Only Make Believe\". He wrote eleven of his [[Hot Country Songs|''Billboard'' Hot Country Songs]] chart-topping hits.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Conway Twitty |url=https://countrymusichalloffame.org/artist/conway-twitty/ |access-date=8 March 2022 |website=Country Music Hall of Fame}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nTwitty was born Harold Lloyd Jenkins on September 1, 1933, in [[Friars Point, Mississippi]]. The Jenkins family were of [[Welsh people|Welsh]] descent.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Breverton |first=Terry |title=Wales: A Historical Companion |date=2009 |publisher=Amberley |isbn=978-1848683266}}</ref> He was named by his great-uncle, after his favorite [[silent movie]] actor [[Harold Lloyd]]. The Jenkins family moved to [[Helena, Arkansas]], when Jenkins was 10 years old. In Helena, Jenkins performed on radio when he was 10, and he formed his first singing group, the [[Phillips County, Arkansas|Phillips County]] Ramblers when he was 12,<ref>{{cite magazine |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=4AoEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA7|title=Conway Twitty: Magnolia Stater|magazine=Billboard |page=7 |date=October 20, 1958 }}</ref> and they had their own show on the local radio station KFFA every Saturday morning.<ref name=bronson>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RVFLAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA44 |title=The Billboard Book of Number One Hits |first= Fred |last=Bronson |date= 1997|isbn=9780823076413 |publisher=Billboard Books|page=44}}</ref> He preached at church revivals when he was a teenager.<ref name=bronson />\n\nTwitty was a baseball player with a [[batting average]] of .450 when he graduated from high school, and he was offered a contract with the [[Philadelphia Phillies]].<ref name=bronson /> He worked for a few months for [[International Harvester]] before accepting the Phillies offer.<ref name=bronson />  However, he was drafted into the [[U.S. Army]] and served in the [[Far East]], during which time he organized a group called the Cimmarons to entertain his fellow soldiers.<ref name=\"Billboard p. 58\">{{Cite magazine |date=October 20, 1958 |title=Conway Twitty Magnolia Stater |page=58 |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}</ref> The Phillies renewed their offer when he returned home, but Twitty had by now become more interested in pursuing a music career.<ref name=bronson />\n\nSoon after hearing [[Elvis Presley]]'s song \"[[Mystery Train]]\", Jenkins began writing rock & roll material. Elvis was a strong influence and Jenkins tried to sound like him. He formed a band called The Rockhousers and wrote a song called \"Rockhouse\".<ref name=mcdowell /> He went to the [[Sun Records|Sun Studios]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], a few times to record with [[Sam Phillips]], the owner and founder.<ref name=mcdowell /> Although he performed alongside Presley and other rock & roll pioneers throughout this period in a regional club scene situated within a 300-mile radius of [[Memphis, Tennessee]], Twitty expressed a fundamental ambivalence toward Phillips' [[rhythm and blues]]-based house production style in an interview for [[Tony Palmer (director)|Tony Palmer]]'s ''[[All You Need Is Love: The Story of Popular Music]]'' (1976), noting that the producer's musical instincts subordinated many elements of Twitty's [[bluegrass music]]-influenced style.\n\nNone of Jenkins's Sun recordings were released at the time, but [[Roy Orbison]] did record his composition \"Rockhouse\" (given to Orbison by Phillips without Jenkins' approval), which was issued on SUN 251 (flipside \"You're My Baby\") in 1956.<ref name=mcdowell />\n\n==Career==\n===Stage name===\nA member of Cimmarons suggested Don Seat as a manager for Jenkins, and Seat indicated to Jenkins that he needed a name with star quality. Jenkins then adopted a [[stage name]] in 1957.<ref name=bronson /> In ''The Billboard Book of Number One Hits'', [[Fred Bronson]] states that the singer named himself after two towns on a map; [[Conway, Arkansas]], and [[Twitty, Texas]], and chose the name Conway Twitty.<ref name=bronson /><ref name=\"Larkin\">{{Cite book |last=Larkin |first=Colin |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_NNmFiUnSmUC |title=The Encyclopedia of Popular Music |date=May 27, 2011 |publisher=Omnibus Press |isbn=9780857125958 |edition=5th |page=3571 |chapter=Twitty, Conway |access-date=April 15, 2017 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_NNmFiUnSmUC&pg=PA3571}}</ref> Twitty himself confirmed this while appearing on the [[Late Night with David Letterman|''David Letterman Show'']] on March 30, 1989.<ref>[https://mix941kmxj.com/is-it-true-conway-twitty-really-got-his-name-from-two-texas-towns/ Is It True Conway Twitty Really Got His Name From two Texas Towns?

Although he recorded three more songs with Mercury, his contract was soon terminated.<ref name=mcdowell />\n\n===Rock and roll career===\nIn 1958, Twitty's fortunes improved when an Ohio radio station had an inspiration, refraining from playing \"I'll Try\" (an MGM single that went nowhere in terms of sales, radio play, and [[jukebox]] play), instead playing the B-side, \"[[It's Only Make Believe]]\", a song written between sets by Twitty and drummer Jack Nance when they were in Hamilton, Ontario, playing at the Flamingo Lounge.<ref name=\"MEMPROJ44\">{{Cite press release |title=The Hamilton Memory Project |date=June 10, 2006 |publisher=Hamilton Spectator Newspaper, Souvenir Edition |page=MP44}}</ref> The record took several months to reach and stay at the [[List of Billboard number-one singles of 1958|top spot]] on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' pop music charts in the United States and number 1 in 21 other countries, becoming the first of nine top-40 hits for Twitty.

Twitty would go on to enjoy rock-and-roll success with songs including \"[[Danny Boy]]\" (Pop number 10) and \"[[Lonely Blue Boy (song)|Lonely Blue Boy]]\" (Pop number 6). \"Lonely Blue Boy\", originally titled \"Danny\", was recorded by Presley for the film ''[[King Creole]]'' but was not used in the soundtrack. This song led to him naming his band the Lonely Blue Boys. They subsequently became the Twitty Birds.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> As his recording career continued, Twitty's music shifted from rockabilly to [[rock and roll]], and Twitty also recorded some [[rhythm and blues|R&B]] and [[blues]] singles.<ref name=Koda/>\n\nBy 1965, Twitty had become disillusioned with rock & roll, particularly with the behavior of the fans,<ref name=ellison /> and walked out of a show in the middle of a performance in New Jersey.<ref name=bronson/> He sued his manager to be released from his contract, and moved to perform country music in [[Oklahoma City]].<ref name=ellison>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P1qyHCmpT7EC&pg=PA248 |title=Country Music Culture: From Hard Times to Heaven|first= Curtis W. |last=Ellison |date= 1995|isbn=9781604739343 |publisher=University Press of Mississippi|page=248}}</ref>\n\n===Country music career===\nTwitty always wanted to record country music, and, beginning in 1965, he did just that. Disc jockeys on some country-music radio stations refused to play his first few country albums, because he was known as a rock and roll singer. However, he had his first top-five country hit, \"The Image of Me\", in July 1968, followed by his first number one country song, \"[[Next in Line (Conway Twitty song)|Next in Line]]\", in November 1968. Few of his singles beginning in 1968 ranked below the top five.\n\nIn 1970, Twitty recorded and released his biggest country hit, \"[[Hello Darlin' (song)|Hello Darlin']]\", which spent four weeks at the top of the country chart and is one of Twitty's most recognized songs. In 1971, he released his first hit duet with [[Loretta Lynn]], \"[[After the Fire Is Gone]]\". It was a success, and many more followed, including \"[[Lead Me On (Conway Twitty and Loretta Lynn song)|Lead Me On]]\" (1971), \"[[Louisiana Woman, Mississippi Man (song)|Louisiana Woman, Mississippi Man]]\" (1973), \"[[As Soon As I Hang Up the Phone]]\" (1974), \"[[Feelins']]\" (1975), \"I Still Believe in Waltzes\", \"[[I Can't Love You Enough]]\", and many others. Together, Conway and Loretta (as they were known in their act) won four consecutive [[Country Music Association]] awards for vocal duo (1972–1975) and a host of other duo and duet awards from other organizations throughout the 1970s.\n\nIn 1973, Twitty released \"[[You've Never Been This Far Before]]\", which was number 1 in country for three weeks that September and also reached number 22 on the pop charts. Some more conservative disc jockeys refused to play the song, believing that some of the lyrics were too sexually suggestive.\n\nIn 1978, Twitty issued the single \"The Grandest Lady of Them All\" honoring the ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]''. (Somewhat ironically, Twitty was never inducted into the ''Opry'' during his lifetime; he remains one of the more prominent [[Nashville]] country artists never to have been an Opry member.) The single reached the top 20, peaking at number 16, but it was well below expectations; it was the first time since 1967 that a single of his failed to reach the top ten, as some radio stations refused to play a song honoring the property of a competitor (broadcast by [[WSM-AM]]).\n\nTwitty soon renewed his image with a new hairstyle, changing from the slicked-back [[pompadour (hairstyle)|pompadour]] style to the curlier style he would keep for the rest of his life; by the late 1970s, Twitty had shifted his musical arrangements into a [[country pop]] style he would maintain for the rest of his career.<ref name=Kamau>{{cite web |url=https://www.classicrockhistory.com/top-10-conway-twitty-songs/ |title=Top 10 Conway Twitty Songs |last=Kamau |first=Eric |date=January 2022 |publisher=Classic Rock History |access-date=2022-11-18}}</ref> His next 23 consecutive singles all made it into the top 10, with 13 reaching number one, including \"[[Don't Take It Away]]\", \"[[I May Never Get to Heaven]]\", \"[[Happy Birthday Darlin']]\", and remakes of major pop hits such as \"[[The Rose (song)|The Rose]]\", \"[[Slow Hand]]\" and \"Tight Fittin' Jeans\", a song written by Michael Huffman, released in June 1981 as the first single from the album ''Mr. T''. The song was Twitty's 26th number one on the country chart. The single stayed at number one for one week and spent a total of 10 weeks on the country chart. In 1985, going by all weekly music trade charts, the song \"[[Don't Call Him a Cowboy]]\" became the 50th single of his career to achieve a number-one ranking. He would have five more through 1990, giving him a total of 55 number-one hits. [[George Strait]] matched the feat of 50 number-one hits in 2002 with his single \"[[She'll Leave You with a Smile]]\" and then reached number 1 for the 56th time in 2007, when the single \"[[Wrapped (Bruce Robison song)|Wrapped]]\" hit the top on the Media Base 24/7 list.\n\nThroughout much of Twitty's country music career his recording home was Decca Records, later renamed [[MCA Records|MCA]]. He signed with the label in late 1965 but left in 1981, when it appeared MCA was marketing and promoting newer acts; management at the label had changed, in addition to other factors that brought on the decision. He joined Elektra/Asylum in 1982. That label's country music unit merged with sister label [[Warner Bros. Records]] in 1983. He stayed with Warner Bros. through early 1987 but then went back to MCA to finish his career. In 1993, shortly before he died, he recorded a new album, ''[[Final Touches]]''.\n\n===Films===\nTwitty had a short career in films, appearing in a few [[B-movies]] in 1960 in which he acted and sang, starting with ''[[Platinum High School]]'', followed by ''[[College Confidential (film)|College Confidential]]'' and ''[[Sex Kittens Go to College]]''.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZjrAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA409 |title=Country Music: A Biographical Dictionary|first= Richard |last=Carlin |date= 2014|isbn=9781135361044 |publisher=Taylor & Francis|page=409}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RT4UAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA204 |title=All Roots Lead to Rock: Legends of Early Rock 'n' Roll : a Bear Family Reader |author= Bear Family Records |date= 1999 |publisher=Schirmer Books|page=204|isbn=9780028648668 }}</ref>\n\n===Baseball===\n[[File:Conway Twitty Nashville Sounds first pitch April 26, 1978.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Twitty throwing out the first pitch at the first [[Nashville Sounds]] game on April 26, 1978]]\nTwitty also played baseball, his second passion. He received an offer to play with the Philadelphia Phillies after high school, but he was drafted into the [[U.S. Army]] before he could sign the contract.

The complex was auctioned off and bought by the Trinity Broadcasting Network in June 1994.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Pinsky |first=Mark I |date=June 9, 1994 |title=Trinity Broadcasting Plans Entertainment Complex in Tennessee |work=[[The Los Angeles Times]] |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1994-06-09-ca-2370-story.html |access-date=November 9, 2021}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nTwitty was married four times, to three different women. His first marriage, to Ellen Matthews, lasted from 1953 to 1954. They had married because Ellen was pregnant with their son, Michael. His second, and longest, marriage was to Temple \"Mickey\" Medley. They were married in 1956 and had three children: Kathy, Joni Lee, and Jimmy Twitty. The couple were divorced in early 1970, but they remarried quietly by the end of 1970. By 1984, after 28 years of marriage on and off, the stress of Twitty's frequent absences took its toll on Mickey, and she and Conway divorced. Mickey Twitty died in 2021. In 1987, Twitty married his 36-year-old office secretary, Delores \"Dee\" Henry, who became his widow in June 1993.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Hevesi |first=Dennis |date=June 6, 1993 |title=Conway Twitty, 59, Dies on Tour; Country Star Had 50 No. 1 Songs |language=en-US |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/06/obituaries/conway-twitty-59-dies-on-tour-country-star-had-50-no-1-songs.html |access-date=2021-11-09 |issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nTwitty made [[Oklahoma City]] his home during most of his recording career, from 1963 to 1972.

[[John Hughey]], who was Twitty's steel guitar player, found him on the ground. Many people, including family members, said that Twitty underwent a change in personality after the accident.\n\nTwitty served on the board of directors of [[CMT (American TV channel)|CMT]] (Country Music Television) from 1984 to 1988, after Music Village Group (Nyhl Henson, Gilbert Biggers, Hall Hardaway Jr. and Benny and Dean Jaggers) acquired CMTV from Glen Daniels. (Inheriting a copyright infringement suit from Viacom, owner of MTV, settled for an undisclosed sum.) The Music Village Group, built Music Village USA adjacent to Twitty City including a state-of-the-art 1,776-seat theatre where CMT uplinked its 24-hour programming and produced live concerts. When Music Village and Twitty was sold in 1989 and CMT in 1990, Conway turned his attention to the burgeoning [[Branson, Missouri|Branson]] market playing to sell-out crowds.

Five years after his death, The Tennessee Appeals Court referred to that case in its opening sentence with, \"This is yet another chapter in the administration of the estate of Harold L. Jenkins, a popular entertainer whose stage name was 'Conway Twitty.'\" The court sided with the daughters finding that the accountants and controllers of Twitty's books while he was alive, who later became the executors of the estate, kept \"limited and sketchy information\" when it came to the family members.<ref>{{Cite web |title=ESTATE OF HAROLD JENKINS v.

The court found Twitty rarely, if ever, memorialized contracts with family members, contractors and employees in writing. Oral promises included bonuses of $1000 per year of employment. The estate attempted to reduce that to $100 per year.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Claim of BILLY R.

Conway's most recent appearance on the country charts was a duet with [[Anita Cochran]], \"(I Want to Hear) A Cheating Song\" (2004), which was made possible by splicing Twitty's vocal from old recordings and interviews, recorded over the years. As a result, Twitty's isolated vocal track was transferred to a digital multitrack and digitally reassembled into the new performance. Like the electronic duets of [[Patsy Cline]] and [[Jim Reeves]], [[Hank Williams]] and [[Hank Williams Jr.]], or [[Nat King Cole]] and [[Natalie Cole]], Cochran added her vocal to backing tracks that had already been produced along with Twitty's reconstructed vocals.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\nCurrently, Bear Family Records offers the single-disc collection ''Conway Rocks'', featuring 30 songs, and ''The Rock 'n' Roll Years'', a comprehensive eight-disc box set showcasing his complete early recordings as a rock artist.<ref>[https://www.bear-family.com/twitty-conway/ Who was/is Twitty, Conway?] Bear Family Records.</ref>\n\n==Legal issues==\n===Taxes===\nTwitty's success in country music was a key factor in his winning the 1983 case ''Harold L. Jenkins (a/k/a Conway Twitty) v. Commissioner'' in United States Tax Court. The Internal Revenue Service allowed Twitty to deduct from his taxes, as an \"ordinary and necessary\" business expense, payments that he had made to repay investors in a defunct fast-food chain called Twitty Burger; the chain disestablished in 1971. The general rule is that the payment of someone else's debts is not deductible. Twitty alleged that his primary motive was \"protecting his personal business reputation.\" The court opinion contained testimony from Twitty about his bond with country music fans.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Google Scholar |url=https://scholar.google.ca/scholar_case?case=10329305433284389410&q=%22memo+1983-667%22 |access-date=August 17, 2015 |publisher=Scholar.google.ca}}</ref> The Tax Court ruled in Twitty's favor and allowed him to deduct these repayments.\n\n===Estate===\nTwitty married four times (twice to Mickey). His widow in 1993, Delores \"Dee\" Henry Jenkins, and his four grown children from the previous marriages, Michael, [[Joni Lee|Joni]], Kathy and Jimmy Jenkins, engaged in a public dispute over the estate. Twitty's will had not been updated to account for the fourth marriage, but Tennessee law reserves one third of any estate to the widow. After years of probate, the four children received the rights to Twitty's music, name and image. The rest of the estate went to public auction, where much of the property and memorabilia was sold after his widow rejected the appraised value.\n\nIn 2008, controversy again erupted in his family when the four remaining children sued [[Sony/ATV Music Publishing]] over an agreement that Twitty and his family signed in 1990. The suit alleged that the terms of the agreement were not fully understood by the children, although they were all adults at the time. It sought to recover copyrights and royalty revenue that the document assigned to the company.<ref>{{Cite web |date=March 1, 2008 |title=Twitty's children sue Sony for royalties |url=http://new.music.yahoo.com/conway-twitty/news/twittys-children-sue-sony-for-royalties--57964316 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120712082622/http://new.music.yahoo.com/conway-twitty/news/twittys-children-sue-sony-for-royalties--57964316 |archive-date=July 12, 2012 |publisher=[[Yahoo!
