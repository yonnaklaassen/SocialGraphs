Reed's grandparents lived in [[Rockmart, Georgia|Rockmart]] and he would visit them from time to time. As a small child running around strumming his guitar he is quoted as saying \"I am gonna be a star. I'm gonna go to [[Nashville]] and be a star.\" Reed's parents separated four months after his birth; he and his sister spent seven years in [[foster home]]s or [[orphanage]]s growing up. Reed was reunited with his mother and stepfather in 1944.\n\nReed graduated from O'Keefe High School, an Atlanta city school. The O'Keefe building still exists today; it was sold to [[Georgia Tech]] and is now part of the university's campus. By high school, Reed was already writing and singing music, having learned to play the guitar as a child. At age 18, he was signed by publisher and record producer [[Bill Lowery (record producer)|Bill Lowery]] to cut his first record, \"[[If the Good Lord's Willing and the Creek Don't Rise]]\".\n\nAt [[Capitol Records]] Reed was promoted as a new \"teen-age sensation\" after recording his own [[rockabilly]] composition \"When I Found You\" in 1956. He recorded both country and rockabilly singles and found success as a songwriter when label mate [[Gene Vincent]] covered his song \"Crazy Legs\" in 1958.<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/>\n\nBy 1958, [[Bill Lowery (record producer)|Bill Lowery]] signed Reed to his company, [[National Recording Corporation]]. He recorded for NRC as both an artist and as a member of the staff band which included [[Joe South]] and [[Ray Stevens]], other NRC artists.\n\nReed married [[Priscilla Mitchell|Priscilla \"Prissy\" Mitchell]] in 1959. They had two daughters, Seidina Ann Hubbard, born April 2, 1960, and Charlotte Elaine (Lottie) Zavala, born October 19, 1970. Mitchell was a member of folk group The Appalachians (\"Bony Moronie\", 1963), and with [[Roy Drusky]] was co-credited on the 1965 country No. 1 \"[[Yes, Mr. Peters]]\".\n\n==Career==\nIn 1959, Reed hit the Billboard \"Bubbling Under the Top 100\", also known as the Roar and Cashbox Country chart with the single \"Soldier's Joy\". After serving two years in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]], Reed moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] in 1961 to continue his songwriting career, which had continued to gather steam while he was in the Army, thanks to [[Brenda Lee]]'s 1960 cover of his song \"That's All You Got to Do\".<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> He also became a popular session and tour guitarist.<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> In 1962, he scored some success with two singles \"[[Goodnight Irene]]\" (as by Jerry Reed & the Hully Girlies, featuring a female vocal group) and \"Hully Gully Guitar\",<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> which found their way to [[Chet Atkins]] at [[RCA Victor]], who produced Reed's 1965 \"If I Don't Live Up to It\".\n\n===\"Guitar Man\"===\nIn July 1967, Reed had his best showing on the country chart (No. 53) with his self-penned \"[[Guitar Man (Jerry Reed song)|Guitar Man]]\", which [[Elvis Presley]] soon covered.<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> Reed's next single was \"Tupelo Mississippi Flash\", a comic tribute to Presley. Recorded on September 1, the song became his first [[Top 20]] hit, going to No. 15 on the chart. Coincidentally Presley came to Nashville to record nine days later on September 10, 1967, and one of the songs he became especially excited about was \"Guitar Man\".\n\nReed recalled how he was tracked down to play on the Presley session: \"I was out on the [[Cumberland River]] fishing, and I got a call from [[Felton Jarvis]] (then Presley's producer at [[RCA Records|RCA Victor]]) He said, 'Elvis is down here. We've been trying to cut \"Guitar Man\" all day long. He wants it to sound like it sounded on your album.' I finally told him, 'Well, if you want it to sound like that, you're going have to get me in there to play guitar, because these guys [you're using in the studio] are [[Flatpicking|straight pickers]]. I [[fingerpicking|pick with my fingers]] and tune that guitar up all weird kind of ways.'\"<ref name=\"tennessean\">{{cite news|url=http://www.tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080902/TUNEIN/80902039|title='Bandit' star Reed dies at 71|newspaper=[[The Tennessean]]|date=September 2, 2008}}</ref>\n\nJarvis hired Reed to play on the session. \"I hit that intro, and [Elvis's] face lit up and here we went. Then after he got through that, he cut [my] \"[[U.S. Male]]\" at the same session. I was toppin' cotton, son.\" Reed also played the guitar for Elvis Presley's [[Big Boss Man (song)|\"Big Boss Man\"]] (1967), recorded in the same session.<ref>Ernst Jorgensen, ''Elvis Presley: A Life in Music'' (St. Martin's Press, 1998), pp. 234–236</ref>\n\nOn January 15 and 16, 1968, Reed worked on a second Presley session, during which he played guitar on a cover of [[Chuck Berry]]'s \"[[Too Much Monkey Business]]\", \"Stay Away\", and \"Goin' Home\" (two songs revolving around Presley's film ''[[Stay Away, Joe]]''), as well as another Reed composition, \"U.S. Male\" (Reed's quoted recollection of \"U.S. Male\" being recorded at the same session as \"Guitar Man\" being incorrect).<ref>Jorgensen, pp. 241–242</ref>\n\nPresley also recorded two other Reed compositions: \"[[A Thing Called Love (song)|A Thing Called Love]]\" in May 1971 for his [[He Touched Me (Elvis Presley album)|''He Touched Me'']] album, and \"Talk About The Good Times\" in December 1973, for a total of four.\n\n[[Johnny Cash]] also released \"[[A Thing Called Love (song)|A Thing Called Love]]\" as a single in 1971.<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> It  reached No. 2 on the [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] Country Singles Chart for North America and was also successful in Europe. It became the title track for a studio [[A Thing Called Love|album]] that he released the following spring.\n\n===1970s===\nAfter releasing the 1970 crossover hit \"[[Amos Moses]]\", a hybrid of rock, country, funk, and Cajun styles which reached No. 8 on the U.S. pop chart,<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> Reed teamed with Atkins for the duet LP ''[[Me & Jerry]]'', which earned the pair the [[Grammy Award for Best Country Instrumental Performance]]. During the 1970 television season, he was a regular on ''[[The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour]]'', and in 1971 he released his biggest hit, the chart-topper \"[[When You're Hot, You're Hot]]\",<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/>KO buddy of the singer, who nevertheless sends him up the river for gambling. Aside from being a major crossover hit, \"When You're Hot, You're Hot\" earned Reed the [[Grammy Award for Best Male Country Vocal Performance|Grammy Award for Best Country Vocal Performance, Male]].\n\n\"When You're Hot, You're Hot\" was the title track of Reed's first solo album, reaching No. 9 Pop and No. 6 on Billboard's Easy Listening chart.

A year later he scored his second number one single with \"Lord, Mr. Ford\" (written by [[Deena Kaye Rose]]), from the album of the same name.<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/>\n\nAtkins, who frequently produced Reed's music, remarked that he had to encourage Reed to put instrumental numbers on his own albums, as Reed always considered himself more of a songwriter than a player. Atkins, however, thought Reed was a better [[fingerstyle]] player than he was himself; Reed, according to Atkins, helped him work out the fingerpicking for one of Atkins's biggest hits, \"[[Yakety Sax]]\".\n\nReed was featured in animated form in a December 9, 1972, episode of [[Hanna–Barbera]]'s ''[[The New Scooby-Doo Movies]]'', \"The Phantom of the Country Music Hall\" (prod. No. 61-10). He sang and played the song \"Pretty Mary Sunlight\". The song is played throughout the episode as Scooby and the gang search for Reed's missing guitar.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, Reed's recording career began to take a back seat to his acting aspirations.<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> In 1974, he co-starred with his close friend [[Burt Reynolds]] in the film ''[[W.W. and the Dixie Dancekings]]''.<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> While he continued to record throughout the decade, his greatest visibility was as a motion picture star and almost always in tandem with headliner Reynolds; after 1976's ''[[Gator (film)|Gator]]'',<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> Reed appeared in 1978's ''[[High-Ballin']]'' and 1979's ''[[Hot Stuff (1979 film)|Hot Stuff]]''. He also co-starred in all three of the ''[[Smokey and the Bandit (franchise)|Smokey and the Bandit]]'' films; the [[Smokey and the Bandit|first]], which premiered in 1977, landed Reed a No. 2 hit with the soundtrack's \"East Bound and Down\".<ref>{{Cite web |last=Tassler |first=Mark|date=2016-08-25 |title=Story Behind the Song: 'Eastbound and Down' by Jerry Reed |url=https://kxrb.com/story-behind-the-song-eastbound-and-down-by-jerry-reed/ |access-date=2023-10-14 |website=KXRB 1140 AM/100.1 FM |language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn 1977, Reed joined entrepreneur [[Larry Schmittou]] and other country music stars including [[Conway Twitty]], [[Cal Smith]], [[Larry Gatlin]], and [[Richard Sterban]], as investors in the [[Nashville Sounds]], a [[minor league baseball]] team of the [[Double-A (baseball)|Double-A]] [[Southern League (1964–2020)|Southern League]] that began play in 1978.<ref>{{citation|first=Larry|last=Woody|title=Schmittou: A Grand Slam in Baseball, Business, And Life|publisher=Eggmann Publishing Company|location=Nashville|year=1996|isbn=1886371334|pages=64–65}}</ref>\n\nHe made two guest appearances on the sitcom ''[[Alice (American TV series)|Alice]]'', in 1978 and 1981.\n\nReed also took a stab at hosting a TV variety show, filming two episodes of ''The Jerry Reed Show'' in 1976.\n\nScottish rockers [[The Sensational Alex Harvey Band]] released a version of \"Amos Moses\" in 1976.\n\nIn 1979, he released a record comprising both vocal and instrumental selections titled, appropriately enough, ''Half & Half''. It was followed one year later by ''Jerry Reed Sings [[Jim Croce]]'', a tribute to the late singer/songwriter. He also starred in a TV movie in that year entitled ''[[Concrete Cowboys (1979 film)|Concrete Cowboys]]''.\n\n===1980s and 1990s===\nIn January 1980, Reed began work on the \"Guitar Man\" re-recording being produced by Presley's producer Felton Jarvis. With a new \"hopped up\" guitar line and Presley on lead vocals, the song reached number one on the country chart.\n\nIn 1982, Reed's career as a singles artist was revitalized by the chart-topping hit \"[[She Got the Goldmine (I Got the Shaft)]]\",<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> followed by \"[[The Bird (Jerry Reed song)|The Bird]]\", which peaked at No. 2.

In the same year he co-starred with [[Robin Williams]] and [[Walter Matthau]] in the [[Michael Ritchie (film director)|Michael Ritchie]] comedy ''[[The Survivors (1983 film)|The Survivors]]''. Reed guest-starred in the October 13, 1983, episode of ''[[Mama's Family]]'', \"The Return of Leonard Oates\" (Episode 13, Season 2), as Naomi Harper's ex-husband.\n\nHe accepted an invitation to open for the British group [[Dexys Midnight Runners]] in the US in 1984, yet left the tour early to appear on the country music comedy TV show ''[[Hee-Haw]]''.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/04/usa |title=Jerry Reed |first=Garth |last=Cartwright |date=September 3, 2008 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref>\n\nAfter an unsuccessful 1986 LP, ''Lookin' at You'', Reed focused on touring until 1992 when he and Atkins reunited for the album ''[[Sneakin' Around]]'' before he again returned to the road. In the meantime, Reed appeared in several interviews and commercial spots for [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Bill Watts)|Mid-South Wrestling]].\n\nReed had a role as a commander/Huey pilot for [[Danny Glover]]'s character in the 1988 movie ''[[Bat*21]]'' starring [[Gene Hackman]]. He also acted as executive producer and screenwriter on this film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/bat-21-film |title=The Most Trusted Place for Answering Life's Questions |publisher=Answers |access-date=August 25, 2015}}</ref>\n\nReed starred in the 1998 [[Adam Sandler]] film ''[[The Waterboy]]'' as Red Beaulieu, the movie's chief antagonist and the head coach for the University of Louisiana Cougars football team. Actor [[Henry Winkler]] recounts that Reed taught him how to bass fish while on location for this movie.<ref> https://x.com/hwinkler4real/status/1774928469346169097 </ref>\n\nHe teamed up with country superstars [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Mel Tillis]], and [[Bobby Bare]] in the group [[Old Dogs (group)|Old Dogs]]. They recorded one album in 1998, entitled ''[[Old Dogs (album)|Old Dogs]]'', with songs written by [[Shel Silverstein]]. Reed sang lead on \"Young Man's Job\" and \"Elvis Has Left The Building\", the latter possibly in deference to Elvis helping launch his career.\n\nIn 1998, the American rock band [[Primus (band)|Primus]] covered the Reed song \"Amos Moses\" on the EP titled ''[[Rhinoplasty (album)|Rhinoplasty]]''.\n\n===2000s===\nIn October 2004, \"Amos Moses\" was featured on the ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas#Soundtrack|Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'' soundtrack which played on the fictional radio station [[K-Rose]]. In 2007, the British band [[Alabama 3]] (known as A3 in the U.S.) covered his hit \"Amos Moses\" on their album, ''[[M.O.R. (album)|M.O.R.]]''\n\nIn June 2005, American guitarist [[Eric Johnson (guitarist, born 1954)|Eric Johnson]] released his album ''[[Bloom (Eric Johnson album)|Bloom]]'' which contained a track titled \"Tribute to Jerry Reed\" in commemoration of his works.\n\nReed appeared as a guest on the fishing television series ''[[Bill Dance Outdoors]]''. In one memorable appearance, Reed caught a particularly big [[largemouth bass]] and planned to have it preserved and mounted by a [[taxidermist]]. Host [[Bill Dance (television host)|Bill Dance]] objected to this plan and freed the fish when Reed was not looking. Reed became enraged when he discovered what had happened and chased Dance off the boat and to shore. This incident was mentioned in one of [[Jeff Foxworthy]]'s stand-up comedy routines.\n\n\"She Got the Goldmine (I Got the Shaft)\" was used in the 2010 film, ''[[The Bounty Hunter (2010 film)|The Bounty Hunter]]''. It plays during the scene where Milo ([[Gerard Butler]]) searches Nicole's ([[Jennifer Aniston]]) apartment.\n\n\"[[You Took All the Ramblin' Out of Me]]\" was used in the 2013 video game ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'', on the radio station [[Grand Theft Auto V soundtrack#Rebel Radio|Rebel Radio]].\n\n\"Talk About the Good Times\" was used as the opening theme for the 2022 streaming TV series ''[[Sprung (TV series)|Sprung]]'' in all but the first episode.
