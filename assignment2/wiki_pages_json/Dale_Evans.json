She spent a lot of time living with her uncle, Dr. L.D. Massey MD FACP, an internal medicine physician, in [[Osceola, Arkansas]]. At age 14, she eloped with and married Thomas F. Fox, with whom she had one son, Thomas F. Fox Jr., when she was 15.

Divorced in 1929, she took the name Dale Evans while working at radio station [[WHAS (AM)|WHAS]] ([[Louisville, Kentucky]]) in the early 1930s after the station manager suggested it because he believed she could promote her singing career with a short pleasant sounding name that announcers and disc jockeys could easily pronounce.<ref name=\"bio\">[http://www.royrogers.com/dale_evans_bio.html Dale Evans' biography] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080217214053/http://www.royrogers.com/dale_evans_bio.html |date=February 17, 2008 }}, royrogers.com; accessed May 16, 2014.</ref>\n\n==Early career==\n[[File:Dale Evans embroidered gauntlets.jpg|thumb|Evans' embroidered white leather gauntlets]]\n[[File:Dale Evans pink sparkly cowboy boots.jpg|thumb|Evans' pink rhinestone cowboy boots]]\nAfter beginning her career singing at the radio station where she was employed as a secretary, Evans had a productive career as a [[jazz]], [[swing music|swing]], and [[big band]] singer that led to a screen test and contract with [[20th Century Fox]] studios. She gained exposure on radio as the featured singer for a time on the [[Edgar Bergen]]/[[Charlie McCarthy]] show.\n\nThroughout this early period, Evans went through two additional failed marriages, first with August Wayne Johns from 1929 to 1935; then with accompanist and arranger Robert Dale Butts from 1937 to 1946. Neither marriage produced children. During her time at [[20th Century Fox]], the studio promoted her as the unmarried supporter of her teenage \"brother\" Tommy (actually her son Tom Fox, Jr.), a deception that continued through her divorce from Butts in 1946 and her development as a cowgirl co-star to [[Roy Rogers]] at [[Republic Studios]].<ref name=\"biodata\"/>\n\n==Joint efforts==\nEvans married [[Roy Rogers]] on [[New Year's Eve]] 1947 at the Flying L Ranch in [[Davis, Oklahoma]], where they had earlier filmed the movie ''[[Home in Oklahoma]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.happytrailsforever.com/view/?pageID=151254 |title=Happy Trails Forever – Honoring the *King of the Cowboys* & *Queen of the West*, Roy Rogers & Dale Evans – Their Story<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=February 6, 2008 |archive-date=March 6, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306031242/http://www.happytrailsforever.com/view/?pageID=151254 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The successful marriage was Rogers' third and Evans' fourth; the two were a team on- and off-screen from 1946 until Rogers' death in 1998. Shortly after the wedding, Evans ended the deception regarding her son Tommy. Roy had an adopted daughter, Cheryl, and two biological children, Linda and Roy Jr. (Dusty), from his second marriage. Together they had one child, Robin Elizabeth, who died of complications of [[Down syndrome]] shortly before her second birthday. Her life inspired Evans to write her bestseller ''Angel Unaware''. Evans was very influential in changing public perceptions of children with developmental disabilities and served as a role model for many parents. After she wrote ''Angel Unaware'', a group then known as the “Oklahoma County Council for Mentally Retarded Children” adopted its better-known name [[Dale Rogers Training Center]] in her honor. She went on to write a number of religious and inspirational books, and she and Roy appeared many times with [[Billy Graham]] in Crusades all over the country, singing gospel songs and giving their testimony.<ref name=\"biodata\">{{cite web|url=http://www.royrogers.com/dale_evans_bio.html|title=Dale Evans Biography|publisher=The Roy Rogers – Dale Evans Museum|access-date=2008-02-05|archive-date=February 17, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080217214053/http://www.royrogers.com/dale_evans_bio.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> Evans and Rogers adopted four other children: Mimi, Dodie, Sandy, and Debbie.<ref name=Roy>{{cite news|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|title=Roy Rogers, 'King of the Cowboys' Dies|date=July 7, 1998|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1998-jul-07-mn-1427-story.html|author=Staff}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1951 to 1957, Evans and Rogers starred in the highly-successful television series ''[[The Roy Rogers Show]]'', in which they continued their cowboy and cowgirl roles, with her riding her trusty [[buckskin (horse)|buckskin]] horse, [[Buttermilk (horse)|Buttermilk]].
