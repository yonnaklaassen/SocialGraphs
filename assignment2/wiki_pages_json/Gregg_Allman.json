He was known for performing in [[the Allman Brothers Band]]. Allman grew up with an interest in [[rhythm and blues]] music, and the Allman Brothers Band fused it with rock music, [[jazz]], and [[country music|country]] at times. He wrote several of the band's most popular songs, including \"[[Whipping Post (song)|Whipping Post]]\", \"[[Melissa (The Allman Brothers Band song)|Melissa]]\", and \"[[Midnight Rider]]\". Allman also had a successful solo career, releasing seven studio albums. He was born and spent much of his childhood in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], before relocating to [[Daytona Beach, Florida]] and then [[Macon, Georgia]].\n\nHe and his brother [[Duane Allman]] formed the Allman Brothers Band in 1969, which reached mainstream success with their 1971 live album ''[[At Fillmore East]]'', but shortly thereafter, Duane was killed in a motorcycle crash. The band continued, and released  ''[[Brothers and Sisters (album)|Brothers and Sisters]]'', which became their most successful album, in 1973. Allman began a solo career with ''[[Laid Back (album)|Laid Back]]'' the same year. He gained some additional fame for his 1975 to 1978 marriage to pop star [[Cher]]. He had an unexpected late-career hit with his cover of the song \"[[I'm No Angel (Bill Medley song)|I'm No Angel]]\" in 1987, and his seventh solo album, ''[[Low Country Blues]]'' (2011), saw the highest chart positions of his career. Throughout his life, Allman struggled with alcohol and substance use, which formed the basis of his memoir ''[[My Cross to Bear]]'' (2012). His final album, ''[[Southern Blood (album)|Southern Blood]]'', was released posthumously on September 8, 2017.\n\nAllman performed with a [[Hammond organ]] and guitar, and was recognized for his soulful voice. For his work in music, Allman was referred to as a [[Southern rock]] pioneer<ref>Sources:\n* {{Cite news |last=Lewis |first=Andy |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/my-cross-bear-318317 |title=My Cross to Bear |date=April 30, 2012 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |access-date=May 27, 2024}}\n* {{Cite news |last=Morris |first=Chris |url=https://variety.com/2017/music/people-news/gregg-allman-dies-dead-69-southern-rock-1202446640/ |title=Gregg Allman, Southern Rock Pioneer, Dies at 69 |date=May 27, 2024 |work=Variety |access-date=May 27, 2017}}\n* {{Cite magazine |last=Gehr |first=Richard |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/gregg-allman-southern-rock-legend-dead-at-69-w433068 |title=Gregg Allman, Southern Rock Pioneer, Dead at 69 |date=May 27, 2017 |magazine=Rolling Stone |access-date=May 27, 2017}}</ref> and received numerous awards, including one [[Grammy Award]]; he was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] and the [[Georgia Music Hall of Fame]].

They met a man named [[Floyd Miles]], and they began to jam with his band, the Houserockers. \"I would just sit there and study Floyd ... I studied how he phrased his songs, how he got the words out, and how the other guys sang along with him\", Gregg would later recall.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=46}} They later formed their first \"real\" band, the Escorts, which performed a mix of [[top 40]] and R&B music at clubs around town.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=49}} Duane, who took the lead vocal role on early demos, encouraged his younger brother to sing instead.{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=21}} He and Duane often spent all of their money on records, as they attempted to learn songs from them. The group performed constantly as music became their entire focus; Gregg missed his high school graduation because he was performing that evening.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=50}} In his autobiography, Gregg recalls listening to Nashville R&B station [[WLAC]] at night and discovering artists such as [[Muddy Waters]], who later became central to his musical evolution.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=63}} He avoided being drafted into the [[Vietnam War]] by intentionally shooting himself in the foot.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=61}}\n\nThe Escorts evolved into [[the Allman Joys]], the brothers' first successful band.

These recordings were later released as ''Early Allman'' in 1973, to Allman's dismay.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=72}} He soon grew tired of performing covers and began writing original compositions.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=73}} They settled in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]] for a time, where in the spring of 1967 they began performing alongside Johnny Sandlin and [[Paul Hornsby]], among others, under various names. They considered disbanding, but Bill McEuen, manager of the [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]], convinced the band to relocate to Los Angeles, giving them the funds to do so.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=77}}\n{{listen|filename=The Allman Brothers Band - Melissa.ogg |title=\"Melissa\"|description=\"[[Melissa (The Allman Brothers Band song)|Melissa]]\" was the first original song Allman completed, and followed over 200 attempts.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://americansongwriter.com/2017/05/behind-song-melissa-allman-brothers/|title=The Allman Brothers Band, \"Melissa\"|date=May 30, 2017|author= Jim Beviglia |work=[[American Songwriter]]|access-date=July 14, 2017}}</ref>|format=[[Ogg]]}}\nHe arranged a recording contract with [[Liberty Records]] in June 1967,{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=41}} and they began to record an album under the new name the [[Hour Glass (band)|Hour Glass]], suggested by their producer, Dallas Smith. Recording was a difficult experience; \"the music had no life to it—it was poppy, preprogrammed shit\", Allman felt.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=81}} Though they considered themselves [[sellouts]], they needed money to live.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=81}} At concerts, they declined to play anything off their [[Hour Glass (Hour Glass album)|debut album]], released that October, instead opting to play the blues.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=91}} Such gigs were sparse, however, as Liberty only allowed one performance per month.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=83}} After some personnel changes, they recorded their second album, ''[[Power of Love (Hour Glass album)|Power of Love]]'', released in March 1968. It contained more original songs by Allman, though they still felt constricted by its process. The band broke up when Duane explicitly told off executives at Liberty. They threatened to [[Non-compete clause|freeze the band]], so they would be unable to record for any other label for seven years.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=96}} Allman stayed behind to appease the label, giving them the rights to a solo album. The rest of the band mocked Allman, viewing him as too scared to leave and return to the South.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=96}} Meanwhile, Duane began doing session work at [[FAME Studios]] in [[Muscle Shoals, Alabama]], where he began putting together a new band. He phoned his brother with the proposition of joining the new band—which would have two guitarists and two drummers. With his deal at Liberty fulfilled, he drove to [[Jacksonville, Florida]], in March 1969 to jam with the new band.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=109}} He called the birth of the group \"one of the finer days in my life ...

A lightbulb finally went off; we needed to make a live album\", said Gregg.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=117}} ''At Fillmore East'', recorded at the [[Fillmore East]] in New York City, was released in July 1971.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=124}} ''At Fillmore East'' peaked at number thirteen on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'s}} [[Billboard 200|Top Pop Albums]] chart, and was certified [[RIAA certification|gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] that October, becoming their commercial and artistic breakthrough.{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=187}} Although suddenly very wealthy and successful, much of the band and its entourage now struggled with addiction to numerous drugs; they all agreed to quit heroin, but [[cocaine]] remained a problem.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=147}} His last conversation with Duane was an argument over cocaine: Gregg took some of his brother's supply, and later denied it when accused. In his memoir, ''My Cross to Bear'', Gregg wrote: \"I have thought of that lie every day of my life ... told him that lie, and he told me that he was sorry and that he loved me.\"{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=193}}\n\nDuane was killed in a motorcycle accident on October 29, 1971, in Macon.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=156}} At his funeral, Gregg performed \"Melissa\", which was his brother's favorite song.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=196}} \"I tried to play and I tried to sing, but I didn't do too much writing. In the days and weeks that followed, ... I wondered if I'd ever find the passion, the energy, the love of making music\", he remembered.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=197}} As the band took some time apart to process their loss, ''At Fillmore East'' became a major success domestically. \"What we had been trying to do for all those years finally happened, and he was gone,\" Gregg remembered.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=198}} He later expanded upon his brother's passing in his memoir:\n\n{{blockquote|When I got over being angry, I prayed to him to forgive me, and I realized that my brother had a blast. ... Not that I got over it—I still ain't gotten over it. I don't know what getting over it means, really. I don't stand around crying anymore, but I think about him every day of my life. ... Maybe a lot of learning how to grieve was that I had to grow up a little bit and realize that death is part of life. Now I can talk to my brother in the morning, and he answers me at night.
