His idiosyncratic style combined elements of [[Folk music|cowboy folk]], [[jazz]], [[Country music|country]], [[swing music|swing]], [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]], [[Popular music|pop]], and [[gypsy style|gypsy]] music. He is perhaps best known for the songs \"I Scare Myself\" and \"Canned Music\". His songs are frequently infused with humor, as evidenced by the title of his tune \"How Can I Miss You When You Won't Go Away?\" His album ''Live at Davies'' (2013) capped over forty years of music.\n\nWriting about Hicks for ''[[Oxford American]]'' in 2007, critic David Smay said, \"[T]here was a time from the ’20s through the ’40s when swing—'hot rhythm'—rippled through every form of popular music. That’s the music Dan Hicks plays, and there’s no single word for it because it wasn’t limited to any one genre. [[Django Reinhardt]] and [[the Mills Brothers]] and [[Spade Cooley]] and [[Hank Garland]] and the [[Boswell Sisters]] and [[Stuff Smith]] and [[Bing Crosby]] all swing. You can make yourself nutty trying to define what Dan Hicks is. Then again, you could just say: Dan Hicks swings.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.danhicks.net/oxford_american_article.pdf|title=Dan Hicks & His Hot Licks|website=Danhicks.net|access-date=August 19, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n{{More citations needed|section|date=July 2023}}\nHicks was born in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]] on December 9, 1941.<ref name=\"Cancer\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://imdb.com/name/nm0382831/|title=Dan Hicks|work=[[Internet Movie Database|IMDb]]|access-date=February 6, 2016|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]}}</ref> the only child of Ivan L. Hicks (a career [[United States Army]] and [[United States Air Force]] [[non-commissioned officer]]) and the former Evelyn Kehl. At age five, Hicks moved with his family to California. Following brief stints in [[Lomita, California|Lomita]], [[Cambria, California|Cambria]], and [[Vallejo, California|Vallejo]], the family settled in [[Santa Rosa, California|Santa Rosa]], the largest city in the [[North Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|North Bay]] subregion of the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], where he was a drummer in grade school and played the snare drum in his school marching band.\n\nAt 14, he was performing with area dance bands. While in high school, he had a rotating spot on ''Time Out for Teens'', a daily 15-minute local radio program. After receiving an [[Associate of Arts|A.A.]] in general education from [[Santa Rosa Junior College]], he went on to earn a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in broadcasting from [[San Francisco State College]] in 1965. Taking up the guitar in 1959, he became part of the [[American folk music revival]] scene during his undergraduate studies, often dropping out intermittently to perform at venues across the United States. Strongly influenced by the [[Jim Kweskin]] [[jug band|Jug Band]], he would cultivate friendships with several of the group's members (most notably [[Maria Muldaur]]) later in life.\n\nAlthough he maintained an equivocal stance toward [[rock music]] (lauding the early recordings of [[Elvis Presley]] and [[The Byrds]] while retrospectively maintaining that \"rock has never really been my thing\"), Hicks joined seminal [[San Francisco Sound|San Francisco]] [[psychedelic rock]] band [[The Charlatans (American band)|The Charlatans]] on [[drum kit|drums]] in 1965.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''I Scare Myself: A Memoir''. Dan Hicks with Kristine McKenna. Jawbone Press, 2017.</ref>\n\nIn this capacity, he participated in the group's celebrated summer 1965 engagement at the [[Red Dog Saloon (Virginia City, Nevada)|Red Dog Saloon]] in [[Virginia City, Nevada]]. After the band failed to secure a long-term recording contract, he switched to [[rhythm guitar]] in 1967 and briefly performed his original material as the group's frontman before leaving in 1968.\n\n==Bandleader==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=July 2023}}\nIn 1967, Hicks formed Dan Hicks and His Hot Licks with violinist [[David LaFlamme]] as a vehicle for new songs rooted in his longstanding appreciation for acoustic-based forms of pre-rock popular music. In one of their earliest engagements, the group opened for The Charlatans; members of the latter band were surprised to see Hicks performing with a different ensemble.\n\nIn 1968, LaFlamme left to form [[It's a Beautiful Day]] and was replaced by jazz violinist and fellow Santa Rosan \"Symphony\" [[Sid Page]]. Following several lineup changes, vocalists Sherry Snow and Christine Gancher, guitarist Jon Weber, and bassist Jaime Leopold filled out the band, which had no drummer. This line-up was signed to [[Epic Records|Epic]] and in 1969 issued the album ''Original Recordings'', produced by [[Bob Johnston]]. The first major Hot Licks lineup lasted until 1971 and then broke up.\n\n{{quote box|quote=\"If Hicks's acoustic stylings react against the excesses of [[1960s counterculture|counterculture]] [[futurism|futurists]], then the key moment on this live album [''Where's the Money?''] comes when he corrects 'his wife' with 'I should say old lady' and no one laughs. Hicks is delicate, tuneful, and droll, with an ear for [[colloquial]] history in words and music both, but he's so diffident about focus that his mock nostalgia is too easy to mistake for the right thing.\"|source=—''[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies]]'' (1981)<ref>{{cite book|last=Christgau|first=Robert|author-link=Robert Christgau|year=1981|title=[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies]]|publisher=[[Ticknor & Fields]]|isbn=089919026X|chapter=Consumer Guide '70s: H|chapter-url=https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_chap.php?k=H&bk=70|access-date=February 26, 2019|via=Robertchristgau.com}}</ref>|width=20%|align=right|style=padding:8px;}}\n\nWhen Hicks reformed the band, Page and Leopold remained, and vocalists Naomi Ruth Eisenberg and Maryann Price joined, followed later by guitarist John Girton and drummer Bob Scott. This group recorded three albums, culminating in 1973's ''Last Train to Hicksville''. Following years of critical success, the album gained the group wider acclaim, peaking at #67 during an eighteen-week stay on the ''Billboard'' album chart; during this period, the group headlined at [[Carnegie Hall]] and appeared on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' and ''[[The Flip Wilson Show]]''. Nevertheless, Hicks dissolved the group by the end of the year, a decision that inspired a [[Charles Perry (food writer)|Charles Perry]]-penned ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' cover story.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/enigmas-on-thin-ice-dan-hicks-breaks-up-his-hot-licks-72492/|title=Enigmas on Thin Ice: Dan Hicks Breaks Up His Hot Licks|first1=Charles|last1=Perry|date=August 30, 1973|publisher=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=October 10, 2019}}</ref> In 1997, he reflected on the decision: “It was getting old. We became less compatible as friends. I was pretty disillusioned, had some money, and didn’t want to do it any more.”<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/08/arts/music/dan-hicks-bandleader-of-the-hot-licks-dies-at-74.html|title=Dan Hicks, of the Hot Licks, Dies at 74; Countered the '60s Sound|first=Peter|last=Keepnews|date=February 7, 2016|website=Nytimes.comaccessdate=October 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\nOver the next decade, Hicks seldom recorded while subsisting on Hot Licks royalties in his adopted hometown of [[Mill Valley, California]]. Envisaged as the soundtrack for an early iteration of [[Ralph Bakshi]]'s ''[[Hey Good Lookin' (film)|Hey Good Lookin']]'' (1982), the acclaimed ''It Happened One Bite'' was released as Hicks' first solo album by [[Warner Bros. Records]] in 1978; however, it only managed to peak at #155 in ''Billboard''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/dan-hicks|title=Dan Hicks|website=Billboard.com|access-date=October 10, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.richieunterberger.com/hicks.html|title=Liner Notes for Dan Hicks's \"It Happened One Bite\"|website=Richieunterberger.com|access-date=October 10, 2019}}</ref> Often performing under the influence of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], [[opioids]] and [[cocaine]], his reputation was sullied by a series of belligerent solo concerts. Following rehabilitation, he appeared with [[Asleep at the Wheel]] at [[Farm Aid]] II in 1986, auguring his return to the popular consciousness. Although he briefly resumed using alcohol and [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] in the mid-1990s (a period that culminated in arrests for public intoxication and driving under the influence), Hicks would credit [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] with maintaining his sobriety.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe classic Hot Licks lineup reunited for an appearance on ''[[Austin City Limits]]'' in 1991. The program also featured Hicks' new group, [[The Acoustic Warriors]], a combination of folk, swing, jazz and country which included Brian Godchaux on violin and mandolin, Paul \"Pazzo\" Mehling on guitar, and Richard Saunders on bass.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://musiclinernotes.wordpress.com/category/blues/page/2/|access-date=February 6, 2016|work=Music Liner Notes|title=Dan Hicks}}</ref> In 1993, the Acoustic Warriors continued to perform locally around San Francisco and on the road, but this edition placed Paul Robinson on guitar, Nils Molin or Alex Baum on [[string bass]], [[Stevie Blacke]] on [[mandolin]] and Josh Riskin on drums. Hicks recorded one CD with the Acoustic Warriors. ''[[Shootin' Straight]]'' was released by [[Private Music]] in 1996. Recorded live at McCabe's in [[Santa Monica]], it featured [[Jim Boggio]] on accordion/piano, Stevie Blacke on mandolin/violin, Paul Robinson on guitar, Alex Baum on bass and former Hot Lick Bob Scott on drums.\n\nBeginning with ''Beatin’ the Heat'' (featuring [[Elvis Costello]], [[Tom Waits]], [[Bette Midler]], [[Ricki Lee Jones]] and [[Brian Setzer]]) in 2000, Hicks returned to releasing albums with a reconstituted lineup of the Hot Licks on Surfdog Records. ''Alive and Lickin’'', a live album with the Hot Licks, followed in 2001. In 2003, Surfdog released ''Dan Hicks and The Hot Licks: Featuring an All-Star Cast of Friends'', a live CD/DVD package. These albums reinvigorated Hicks, and the guests reflected their longtime admiration for the Hot Licks. Dan Hicks and The Hot Licks' comeback was met with widespread critical acclaim and led to several more albums under the Surfdog label. ''Selected Shorts'' featuring [[Jimmy Buffett]], [[Willie Nelson]] and [[Gibby Haynes]] was released in 2004, then a downloadable compilation of Hicks's previously released duets in 2007, ''Tangled Tales'' in 2009, ''Crazy For Christmas'' in 2010, and ''Live at Davies'' in 2013. To honor Dan on the first anniversary of Dan Hicks passing, Surfdog Records released ''Greatest Licks – I Feel Like Singin’'', a compilation album paying tribute and celebrating Dan's life and legacy, in February 2017.\n\nIn his later years, Hicks occasionally played jazz standards at intimate venues in the San Francisco Bay Area with Bayside Jazz.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baysidejazz.com/|title=Bayside Jazz with Dan Hicks|website=Baysidejazz.com|date=September 11, 2010|access-date=February 6, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160211173116/http://www.baysidejazz.com/|archive-date=February 11, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn the film  ''[[Class Action (film)|Class Action]]'' (1991), Hicks is seen performing with Eisenberg and Price at Rosatti's in San Francisco. He also can be seen in several documentary films, including ''[[Revolution (1968 film)|Revolution]]'' (1968) and ''Rockin at the Red Dog'' (1996).\n\nFrom its founding in 1977 until late in his life, Hicks played with the San Francisco Bay Area's Christmas Jug Band.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://christmasjugband.com/story.html|title=The Christmas Jug Band: Media Kit: The CJB Story|website=Christmasjugband.com|access-date=October 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[Thomas Dolby]] covered his song \"I Scare Myself\".<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\">{{cite book | first= David | last= Roberts | year= 2006 | title= [[British Hit Singles & Albums]] | edition= 19th | publisher= Guinness World Records Limited | location= London | isbn= 1-904994-10-5 | page= 163}}</ref>\n\n==Musical style==\n''Billboard'' called Hicks an eccentric whose music contained elements of country, folk, jazz, and comedy.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/300146/dan-hicks/biography|access-date=February 6, 2016|title=Dan Hicks Biography|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]}}</ref> Hicks called his music \"folk swing\".<ref>{{YouTube|id=0pAi2vpO-7k#t=1m20s|title=Dan Hicks Describing His Musical Style 7-3-07 at Riverwalk Center, Breckenridge, CO.}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nFollowing an on-and-off relationship spanning two decades, Hicks married concert promoter Clare \"CT\" Wasserman (a protege of [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]] and the former wife of bassist [[Rob Wasserman]]) in February 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcall.com/2004/08/21/singer-songwriter-dan-hicks-gets-in-his-licks-about-music-and-modern-culture/|access-date=February 6, 2016|date=August 21, 2004|first=Len|last=Righi|work=[[The Morning Call]]|title=Singer-songwriter Dan Hicks gets in his licks about music and modern culture|publisher=[[Tribune Media]]}}</ref> He was diagnosed with [[throat cancer|throat]] and [[liver cancer]] in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/wife-singer-band-leader-dan-hicks-dies-age-36762023|access-date=February 6, 2016|date=February 6, 2016|author=The Associated Press|author-link=The Associated Press|work=[[ABC News (United States)|ABC News]]|title=Wife Says Singer and Band Leader Dan Hicks Dies at Age 74|publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]}}</ref> In March 2015, Hicks announced that he had been diagnosed with liver cancer.<ref name=\"Cancer\">{{cite web|url=http://www.danhicks.net|title=Welcome to Hicksville!|publisher=Danhicks.net |date=December 9, 1941|access-date=February 6, 2016}}</ref> On February 6, 2016, at age 74, he died from cancer at his home in Mill Valley.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wral.com/wife-says-singer-and-band-leader-dan-hicks-dies-at-age-74/15330491/ |access-date=February 6, 2016 |date=February 6, 2016 |work=[[WRAL-TV]] |title=Wife says singer and band leader Dan Hicks dies at age 74 |publisher=[[Capitol Broadcasting Company]] |author=WRAL Staff |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160207103037/http://www.wral.com/wife-says-singer-and-band-leader-dan-hicks-dies-at-age-74/15330491/ |archive-date=February 7, 2016 |df=mdy }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ww2.kqed.org/arts/2016/02/06/dan-hicks-san-francisco-folk-jazz-pioneer-dead-at-74/|access-date=February 6, 2016|date=February 6, 2016|title=Dan Hicks, San Francisco Folk Jazz Pioneer, Dead at 74|last=Jones|first=Kevin L.}}</ref>\n\nHis posthumous memoir, ''I Scare Myself'', was published in 2017.
