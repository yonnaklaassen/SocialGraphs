Having performed together locally in their native [[Lookout Mountain, Georgia]],  since the 1970s, the four sisters began singing full-time in the 1980s and signed to [[Warner Records]] Nashville in 1984. Their greatest commercial success came between then and 1991, when they charted fifteen top-ten hits on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] chart, five of which went to number one: \"[[I Fell in Love Again Last Night]]\", \"[[Just in Case (The Forester Sisters song)|Just in Case]]\", \"[[Mama's Never Seen Those Eyes]]\", \"[[Too Much Is Not Enough]]\" (with [[The Bellamy Brothers]]), and \"[[You Again (Forester Sisters song)|You Again]]\". They won the [[Academy of Country Music]] Group of the Year award in 1986 and were nominated three times for a [[Grammy Award]]. In addition to their country music albums, they released multiple albums of [[gospel music]] and one of [[Christmas music]].\n\nThe group's sound is defined primarily by four-part vocal harmonies, most often with Kim or Kathy singing lead vocals. Their style has been compared to other contemporary family-based country music groups such as [[The Judds]] and [[The Whites]], while critical reception to their body of work has generally been mixed. The sisters retired from the music industry in 1996 and found work in other fields.\n\n==Early life==\nThe Forester Sisters are four sisters who were born and raised in [[Lookout Mountain, Georgia]]: Kathy (born January 4, 1955), June (born September 22, 1956), Kim (born November 4, 1960), and Christy (born December 21, 1962).<ref name=\"whitburn\">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2017|publisher=Record Research, Inc|year=2017|pages=130|isbn=978-0-89820-229-8}}</ref><ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-forester-sisters-mn0000067814/biography | title=The Forester Sisters biography | publisher=Allmusic | access-date=April 20, 2019}}</ref> The sisters' parents, Vonnie Geneva (née Gray; 1932–2018) and Clyde D. \"Bunk\" Forester,<ref name=\"fabulous\"/> would encourage the four to rehearse music for church choir every week, something which Christy later observed would help the sisters learn how to sing in harmony.<ref name=\"chapter\"/>\n\nIn addition to their church work, Kathy and June performed in local bands during the late 1970s while also holding jobs as schoolteachers.

Christy described the album as \"roots that we returned to\", a reference to the sisters' upbringing as singers in their churches. Norman, Beckett, and Stroud co-produced the album.<ref name=\"fair\"/> Later in 1989 came a ''Greatest Hits'' package. Included on it were two new songs: \"[[Don't You (song)|Don't You]]\" and \"[[Leave It Alone (The Forester Sisters song)|Leave It Alone]]\", both of which reached top ten on Hot Country Songs that year.

Kim highlighted the title track in particular, stating that she was going through a divorce at the time of recording and felt that at the age of 31, she was \"too old to start dating again\".<ref name=\"sassy\"/> Tom Roland of AllMusic wrote that the album was \"wide-ranging stylistically, with a strong dose of wit, particularly in the title track and 'Redneck Romeo.'\"<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/i-got-a-date-mw0000072894 | title=''I Got a Date'' | publisher=AllMusic | access-date=March 24, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe sisters took a hiatus from recording for much of the mid-1990s, but continued to tour regionally, though primarily on weekends in order to tend to their children the rest of the week. They returned to the studio for a new album called ''More Than I Am'' in 1996. Warner marketed the album as \"positive country\", featuring positive and spiritual messages without being explicitly [[contemporary Christian music]] in nature, and taking inspiration from similar releases by [[Ricky Van Shelton]] and [[Susie Luchsinger]]. Christy's husband, Gary Smith, produced the album and played keyboards on it. Among the contributing songwriters were [[Karen Staley]] and [[Paul Overstreet]], the latter of whom had previously co-written the group's \"I Fell in Love Again Last Night\".<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/113187201/ | title=Get the message: The Forester Sisters puts positive spin on country | work=The Tennessean | date=September 2, 1995 | access-date=March 24, 2020 | author=Bonna M. de la Cruz | pages=1, 2}}</ref> After this album, the sisters decided to retire from the music business, citing both a desire to spend more time with their families and the genre's increasing focus on male artists.
