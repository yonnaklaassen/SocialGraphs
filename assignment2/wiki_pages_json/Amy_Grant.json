She recorded a demo tape for her parents with church youth-leader [[Brown Bannister]]. While Bannister was dubbing a copy of the tape, [[Chris Christian]], the owner of the recording studio heard the demo and called [[Word Records]]. He played it over the phone and she was offered a recording contract, five weeks before her 16th birthday.\n\nIn 1977, she recorded her first album, ''[[Amy Grant (album)|Amy Grant]]'', produced by [[Brown Bannister]], who would also produce her next 11 albums. It was released in early 1978, one month before her high-school graduation. Toward the end of 1978 she performed her first ticketed concert after beginning her first year at [[Furman University]].\n\nIn May 1979, while at the album-release party for her second album, ''[[My Father's Eyes (album)|My Father's Eyes]]'', Grant met [[Gary Chapman (musician)|Gary Chapman]], who had written the title track and would become her first husband.

The album contains the signature track, \"[[El Shaddai (song)|El Shaddai]]\" (written by [[Michael Card]]) and the Grant-Chapman penned song, \"In a Little While\". \"El Shaddai\" was later awarded one of the \"[[Songs of the Century]]\" by the [[RIAA]] in 2001. Grant received her first [[Grammy Award]] for Best Contemporary Gospel Performance, as well as two [[GMA Dove Awards]] for Gospel Artist of the Year and Pop/Contemporary Album of the Year. ''Age to Age'' became the first Christian album by a solo artist to be certified gold (1983) and the first Christian album to be certified platinum (1985).<ref name=\"cnn\"/>\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Grant began touring and recording with young up-and-coming songwriter [[Michael W. Smith]]. Grant and Smith continue to have a strong friendship and creative relationship, often writing songs for or contributing vocals to each other's albums, and as of 2019, often touring together annually during November and December putting on Christmas concerts.

The mainstream song \"Saved by Love\" was a minor hit, receiving airplay on radio stations featuring the newly emerging Adult Contemporary format. The album's title song received some pop radio airplay and [[Crossover (music)|crossed over]] to No. 96 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, and \"1974 (We Were Young)\" and \"Saved By Love\" also charted as Adult Contemporary songs.
