Prior to the group's foundation, Kimball recorded as a solo artist. The original lineup recorded one [[Gloriana (album)|self-titled album]] for Emblem/[[Reprise Records]] in 2009, which included their first chart hit, \"[[Wild at Heart (Gloriana song)|Wild at Heart]]\". Kimball left before the release of the band's second album ''[[A Thousand Miles Left Behind]]'', which produced their highest-charting single, \"[[(Kissed You) Good Night]]\", along with the top 20 \"[[Can't Shake You]]\". After a third album, ''[[Three (Gloriana album)|Three]]'', Reinert left as well, effectively disbanding the group.\n\n==History==\nBrothers Tom and Mike Gossin were born in [[Utica, New York]].<ref name=\"cmt\"/> They both took [[classical piano]] lessons from age 5.  At 10, Tom began studying jazz with a local [[jazz music|jazz]] musician and at 12, he began to play the guitar. Tom, along with third Gossin brother Stephen, founded their own band \"Oblique\" in high school. Stephen and Tom later moved to [[Wilmington, North Carolina]] together, where they attended [[University of North Carolina at Wilmington]], with Tom majoring in guitar. After a professor suggested that he pursue songwriting and performing, Tom dropped out of the university and started playing music and selling independent records at gigs he played.  Mike learned drums at age 8 and, like Tom, started playing guitar at 12.  He moved to Wilmington after high school to join Tom there.  He joined a group with Tom and Stephen during which time they filmed a reality series that did not last long. Tom and Mike moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], where they began performing as a duo.<ref name=\"cmt\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/gloriana/bio.jhtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090307034708/http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/gloriana/bio.jhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=March 7, 2009|title=Gloriana biography|work=[[Country Music Television|CMT]]|access-date=2009-04-07}}</ref><ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p1110916/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Gloriana biography|last=Leggett|first=Steve|work=[[Allmusic]]|access-date=2009-06-15}}</ref>\n\n[[Rachel Reinert]] was born in [[Sarasota, Florida]], and lived in [[Marietta, Georgia]] before moving to [[Santa Ana, California]] with her family at age 6.
