Both Firebaugh and Scruggs later left the band as well; Mark Miller has become the band's third bassist. The name of the band is taken from a mangled phone number from ''[[Hee Haw]]'' comedian [[Junior Samples]]' car salesman skit.<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ygsEAAAAMBAJ&q=BR-549|title=Dial BR5-49 For Alternate Country|magazine=Billboard|last=Bessman |first=Jim|date=15 July 1995|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|language=en|page=1}}</ref>\n\nBR549 released six albums and two EPs, including three albums on [[Arista Nashville]] and two on [[Dualtone Records]]. The band's self-titled [[BR5-49 (album)|debut album]] produced three singles on the ''Billboard'' country charts in 1996. The band was nominated three times for the [[Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]], in 1996 (\"Cherokee Boogie\"), 1997 (\"Wild One\") and 1999 (\"Honky Tonk Song\").<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/br5-49/8344 |title=BR5-49 |publisher=[[Grammy Awards]]}}</ref> As well as a nomination for the Top New Vocal Duo or Group award from the [[Academy of Country Music Awards]] in 1997.<ref name=\"Past winners and nominees\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.acmcountry.com/winners |title=Winners database |work=ACM Country |access-date=December 29, 2022}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Expand section|More info on each album, critical reception, sound|date=January 2009}}\nBefore moving to Nashville and forming BR5-49, Chuck Mead played in a band called Homestead Grays, a roots-rock outfit based in his hometown of [[Lawrence, Kansas]].<ref name=\"Larkin90\"/> Gary Bennett, meanwhile fronted an informal band that played at [[Robert's Western World|Robert's Western Wear]], a clothing store in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], when he met Mead at a nearby bar.<ref name=Huey/> The two then decided to form a band officially, and completing the lineup were electric bassist Jim \"Bones\" Becker, then [[upright bass]]ist \"Smilin'\" Jay McDowell (formerly of another band called Hellbilly), multi-instrumentalist Don Herron, and drummer \"Hawk\" Shaw Wilson. They assumed the name BR5-49 (from the telephone number of a used car dealer in a running [[Junior Samples]] comedy sketch on the television series ''[[Hee Haw]]''),<ref name=Huey/> and began playing for tips at Robert's.\n\n===1995–2000: Arista Nashville===\nThey were signed by [[Arista Nashville]] in September 1995.<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ag4EAAAAMBAJ&q=BR-549&pg=PA30|title=Twain Dominates Canadian Awards; BR-549 Signed To Arista, Finally|magazine=Billboard|last=Flippo |first=Chet|date=30 September 1995|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|language=en|page=30}}</ref> The band's first release for the label was an [[extended play]] entitled ''Live at Robert's'', which comprised originals and cover songs.<ref name=\"Larkin90\"/> Following it in 1996 was their full-length debut album, also titled ''[[BR5-49 (album)|BR5-49]]''.<ref name=\"Larkin90\"/> Despite minimal support from country radio,<ref name=Huey/> the album's lead-off single \"Cherokee Boogie\" (a cover of a [[Moon Mullican]] song) reached No.&nbsp;44 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country singles charts in the US, and No.&nbsp;21 on the ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' country charts in Canada. Following this song were \"Even If It's Wrong\" and \"Little Ramona (Gone Hillbilly Nuts)\",<ref name=\"Larkin90\"/> which respectively reached No.&nbsp;68 and No.&nbsp;61 in the US. The album itself was a No.&nbsp;33 on the [[Top Country Albums]] chart. The band also toured with [[The Mavericks]], [[Junior Brown]], and [[The Black Crowes]] and played on the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] music program ''[[Austin City Limits]]'' in 1997.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/klru/austin/artists/program78.html Mary Chapin Carpenter followed by BR5-49], Austin City Limits, 1997</ref>   According to the All Music Guide to Country, BR5-49's recording of \"Honky Tonk Song\" on the BR5-49 album should be considered an essential country song, although it does not consider either the album itself, or the group essential.<ref>Vladimir Bogdanov, et al, editors ''All Music Guide to Country'', 2nd Edition, Ann Arbor: AMG, 2003</ref>\n\nBR5-49's second album, ''[[Big Backyard Beat Show]]'', was released in 1998.<ref name=\"Larkin90\"/> Despite not producing a chart single, this album reached No.&nbsp;38 on the Top Country Albums chart. After touring with [[Brian Setzer]], the band issued a live album, ''Coast to Coast'', in 1999 on Arista as well. The band left Arista in 2000 after the label was merged with [[Sony BMG]].\n\n===2001–present===\nAfter being dropped from Arista, they signed to Lucky Dog Records, a subsidiary of [[Epic Records]]. Their first release for the label, 2001's ''This Is BR549'', also eliminated the [[hyphen]] from the band's name.<ref name=Huey/> Its only single, \"Too Lazy to Work, Too Nervous to Steal\", peaked at No.&nbsp;11 on Country Singles Sales but did not enter the country singles charts proper. After this album, both Bennett and McDowell left the band, with Geoff Firebaugh succeeding McDowell as upright bassist, and [[Chris Scruggs]] taking over on guitar and vocals. The new lineup made its first appearance in 2003 on their self released album ''Temporarily Disconnected''. In 2004, they signed with [[Dualtone Records]] and released ''Tangled in the Pines''. Scruggs left the band to tour solo in 2005. Firebaugh also left to start his own band, Hillbilly Casino. Mark Miller replaced Firebaugh. A second album for Dualtone, ''Dog Days'', was released in early 2006.\n\nSince 2013 the band has been on hiatus, with Chuck Mead working solo with Mark Miller playing bass, and Don Herron touring with [[Bob Dylan]].  On July 12, 2012, Jay McDowell announced on his personal Facebook page that the original line-up of BR5-49 would open for [[Old Crow Medicine Show]] at Woods Amphitheater in Nashville, TN on July 28. On July 27, 2012, the (reunited) original lineup recorded an original Gary Bennett song called \"A Truck Stop Christmas\" at the East Nashville Studio of Phil Harris, which was released on the 2012 Christmas compilation ''An East Nashville Christmas''.  On May 9, 2013, it was announced that the original lineup would play together live once again, this time at the Havelock Country Jamboree in Canada on August 17, 2013.\n\n==Status of former members==\nOriginal co-frontman Gary Bennett released his solo debut, ''Human Condition'', in February 2006. In October 2010 [[Raucous Records]] released Bennett's follow up album ''My Ol' Guitar'' co-produced by [[Kenny Vaughan]] and including several BR549 re-recordings.\n\nSmilin' Jay McDowell has gone on to work in post production in the music video world. He is now in charge of the video department for the [[Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum]] in Nashville. He directed a DVD project for Gary Bennett titled ''Inside and Out''.\n\nFormer bassist Geoff Firebaugh founded a [[rockabilly]] band named Hillbilly Casino that are a crowd favorite in downtown Nashville on lower Broadway.\n\nChris Scruggs released a solo album titled ''Anthem'' in 2009. As of 2015, he is the bassist and multi-instrumentalist in [[Marty Stuart]]’s backing band, The Fabulous Superlatives.\n\nChuck Mead released ''Journeyman's Wager'' in 2009 and toured with his Grassy Knoll Boys in support of the release; this was followed by the classic-country covers album ''Back at the Quonset Hut'' in 2012 and ''Free State Serenade'' in 2014.  In 2006 Chuck began his association with the hit Broadway Musical ''[[Million Dollar Quartet (musical)|Million Dollar Quartet]]'' beginning in Florida as the Musical Arranger and Musical Director; he has also worked with the cast at The [[Village Theatre]] near Seattle, Washington, The [[Goodman Theatre]] in Chicago and The [[Nederlander Theatre]] on Broadway in New York City.  He is currently{{when|date=June 2017}} working with the new cast in England as they prepare to open at The [[Noël Coward Theatre]] in  [[City of Westminster]].\n\nMark Miller was a founding member of The Ex-Husbands, formed in New York City in 1993 with lead singer Anders Thomsen and drummer Michael Smith. The band released two critically acclaimed albums on Tar Hut Records – a self-titled debut and the follow-up, ''All Gussied Up''.  Both made the Gavin Americana top 20 and the latter reached that chart's top 10. Miller released the solo record ''Dodsen Chapel'' in 2005.\n\nOriginal bass picker Jim \"Bones\" Becker is now retired and says, \"I'm not doing anything now, and I'm getting damn good at it!\"\n\n==Musical style and influences==\n{{Expand section|date=July 2023}}\nAccording to ''[[Trouser Press]]'', while [[alternative country]] bands typically try to emulate the sound of pre-[[rock and roll]] era country music, BR549's sound draws from post-rock and roll styles, \"when honky tonk, [[rockabilly]], [[Western swing]], bittersweet storyteller swill and [[Sheb Wooley]] all commingled in search of proper homes in the evolving [[country music|country]] landscape.\"<ref name=TrouserPress>{{cite web |url=https://trouserpress.com/reviews/br549/ |title=BR549 |last= |first= |publisher=Trouser Press |access-date=2022-11-09}}</ref> BR549's sound  encompasses alternative country,<ref name=Huey>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/br5-49-mn0000071958/biography |title=BR5-49 Biography |last=Huey |first=Steve |publisher=AllMusic|access-date=2022-11-09}}</ref><ref name=TrouserPress/> Western swing,<ref name=Huey/> [[Bakersfield sound]],<ref name=Huey/> rockabilly<ref name=Huey/><ref name=TrouserPress/> and [[country rock]].<ref name=Huey/><ref name=TrouserPress/> According to ''Trouser Press'', the band \"poised themselves as authentic defenders of the faith, but a name taken from a recurring ''Hee Haw'' skit and a predilection for campy vintage clothing threatened to make them alt-country’s answer to [[Sha Na Na]].\"<ref name=TrouserPress/> Steve Huey of [[AllMusic]] described their sound and appearance as \"unabashedly retro\", as the band's members dressed in \"old, budget-friendly clothes\".<ref name=Huey/>\n\n==Members==\n* Chuck Mead – [[guitar]], vocals\n* Gary Bennett – guitar, vocals\n* Shaw Wilson – [[Drum kit|drums]], backing vocals\n* Don Herron – [[fiddle]], [[steel guitar]], [[mandolin]], [[Dobro]], [[banjo]]\n* Smilin' Jay McDowell – upright bass\n\n===Former members===\n* \"Bones\" Jim Becker – electric bass\n* \"Buggs\" Tex Austin (Mark Ude) – saxophone\n* Chris Scruggs – guitar, vocals\n* Geoff Firebaugh – upright bass\n* Mark Miller – [[upright bass]], vocals\n\n==Discography==\n===Albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!
