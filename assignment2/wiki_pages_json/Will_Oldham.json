Regarding the name changes during this period (1993–1997), Oldham said:\n{{cquote|I guess the idea is that when you have a name of a group or an artist, then you expect that the next record, if it has the same name, should be the same group of people playing on it. And I just thought we were making a different kind of record each time, with different people, and different themes, and different sounds. So I thought it was important to call it something different so that people would be aware of the differences.<ref name=\"phoenix\"/>}}\n\nWill stated in a 1995 interview with [[KCRW]] that the name Palace Flophouse was inspired by reading [[John Steinbeck]]'s ''[[Cannery Row (novel)|Cannery Row]]''. Beginning in 1998, Oldham has primarily used the moniker Bonnie 'Prince' Billy, which draws inspiration from several sources:\n{{cquote|[T]he name has so many different references that it could almost have a life of its own.
