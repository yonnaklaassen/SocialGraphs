Rodman's parents moved often. After living in so many places, Rodman's musical tastes included eclectic sounds like [[Cajun]] and [[Calypso music]]. When Rodman was 17 years old, she began singing advertising [[jingle]]s. Her voice was heard nationally on a [[Totino's|Jeno's Pizza]] commercial. Rodman left for college at eighteen to study music. Her college roommate was future female Country vocalist [[Janie Fricke]]. The two became fast friends and were hired as jingle singers for the [[Tanner Agency]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], Tennessee. Rodman also sang with a local nightclub band called Phase II.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nIn the mid-1970s, Rodman worked primarily as a background vocalist. In 1980, Judy married drummer and professional fisherman, John Rodman and the couple moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], Tennessee. Rodman continued to record radio and TV jingles for mainstream companies while trying to break into the country music business.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\n==Country music stardom in the 1980s==\nSoon, Rodman switched occupations and went back to singing background vocals. She backed Country stars [[Johnny Cash]], [[Tammy Wynette]] and more. She also sang back up for legendary Blues performer [[Ray Charles]]. Rodman soon decided she wanted to become a Country singer. Success came when she was soon signed to [[MTM Records]].<ref name=\"auto1\"/> She was the first artist to be signed to the fledgling record label.<ref name=\"auto3\"/>\n\nHer debut single, \"I've Been Had By Love Before,\" entered the Top forty of the Country singles chart (#40). Her next single, \"You're Gonna Miss Me When I'm Gone,\" did as well (#33). By the end of 1985, she peaked at number thirty with her self-penned song \"I Sure Need Your Lovin\". Also that year, Rodman won the coveted [[Academy of Country Music]]'s \"Top New Female Vocalist\" award.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nJudy Rodman released her first album in 1986. It was simply titled ''[[Judy (Judy Rodman album)|Judy]]'', and it contained the three previously released singles from 1985 as well as new material. One of the new songs, \"[[Until I Met You]],\" became a number one Country hit. The song spent the week of July 19 at the top of the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs|Hot Country Singles]] chart list.\nRodman had continuing chart success that year. \"[[She Thinks That She'll Marry]]\" was the next single released off of the ''[[Judy (Judy Rodman album)|Judy]]'' album. It became a top ten Country hit as well; peaking at number nine.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nIn 1987, Rodman's second album entitled ''[[A Place Called Love (Judy Rodman album)|A Place Called Love]]'' was released. The album spawned two top ten Country hits: \"[[Girls Ride Horses Too]]\" and a cover of [[Bob Dylan]]'s \"[[I'll Be Your Baby Tonight]]\".<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nSeveral singles from Rodman's forthcoming third album proved modestly successful with radio, but the MTM Records label folded. Subsequently, the album was never released. The same proved true with her record labelmates, [[Girls Next Door|The Girls Next Door]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/girls-next-door-mn0000663648|title=Girls Next Door &#124; Biography & History|website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref>\n\nAfter MTM records [[liquidation|liquidated]], Rodman eventually faded away from the country music spotlight, but not out of the business altogether.\n\n==New horizons==\nSoon, Rodman faded off ''Billboard''<nowiki/>'s Country Music charts. This around the same time Neo-Traditional Country singers were entering Nashville and the Country market's taking up spots on the country music charts, and finding their way on the Top 10 and Top 20 on the charts. Singers like, [[George Strait]], [[Randy Travis]], [[Kathy Mattea]], [[Patty Loveless]], [[Ricky Van Shelton]], [[Lyle Lovett]], and [[Dwight Yoakam]] all found their way to making hits on the Country charts around this time. Country-Pop-styled vocalists, like Rodman, and her friend [[Janie Fricke]] to name a few, were soon finding less and less success on the Country charts.\n\nHowever, Rodman found different ways to keep herself busy in the music industry. Around this time, Rodman worked in the recording studio as a track producer, vocal producer and background singer once again. As a new decade approached, she re-found success as a songwriter as well. She wrote songs for [[Warner-Chappell]] music, [[Chrysalis Music]], and her own publishing company, [[Favorable Wind Songs]]. One of many successful compositions were [[LeAnn Rimes]] No.&nbsp;1 hit, \"One Way Ticket\" and the [[Tammy Wynette]]/[[Wynonna Judd]] duet, \"Girl Thang\". She also developed her own vocal training method and began working with all kinds of genres of singers, including singer-songwriter [[Radney Foster]], new pop artists [[Mat Kearney]] and [[Emil Bishaw]] and country artists [[Bryan White]] and Australian star [[Shea Fisher]] and musical theater projects like her own [[Runaway Home]] and We the People.<ref name=\"auto2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.judyrodman.com/index.htm|title=Judy Rodman – All Things Vocal|website=Judyrodman.com}}</ref>\n\nToday, Rodman is a busy professional vocal coach, recording studio producer and songwriter, as well as continuing her recording session singing and live performances. Her trademarked vocal training method is called \"Power, Path, and Performance\". Rodman currently sells CD vocal training products available on her official website.<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\n==Discography==\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:14em;\"| Title\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:14em;\"| Album details\n! colspan=\"1\"| Peak positions\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n! width=\"65\"| [[Top Country Albums|US Country]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[Judy (Judy Rodman album)|Judy]]''\n|\n* Release date: 1986\n* Label: MTM\n| 23\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[A Place Called Love (Judy Rodman album)|A Place Called Love]]''\n|\n* Release date: 1987\n* Label: MTM\n| 29\n|-\n|}\n\n===Singles===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Year\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:22em;\"| Single\n! colspan=\"2\"| Peak chart<br />positions\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Album\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n! width=\"45\"| [[Hot Country Songs|US Country]]\n! width=\"45\"| [[RPM (magazine)|CAN Country]]\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\"| 1985\n! scope=\"row\"| \"I've Been Had by Love Before\"\n| 40\n| —\n| align=\"left\" rowspan=\"5\"| ''Judy''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"You're Gonna Miss Me When I'm Gone\"\n| 33\n| —\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"I Sure Need Your Lovin'\"\n| 30\n| —\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 1986\n! scope=\"row\"| \"[[Until I Met You]]\"\n| 1\n| —\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"[[She Thinks That She'll Marry]]\"\n| 9\n| —\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\"| 1987\n! scope=\"row\"| \"[[Girls Ride Horses Too]]\"\n| 7\n| 10\n| align=\"left\" rowspan=\"3\"| ''A Place Called Love''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"[[I'll Be Your Baby Tonight]]\"\n| 5\n| 9\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"I Want a Love Like That\"\n| 18\n| 41\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 1988\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Goin' to Work\"\n| 43\n| —\n| align=\"left\" rowspan=\"2\"| ''Goin' to Work'' <small>(unreleased)</small>\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"I Can Love You\"\n| 45\n| 64\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" style=\"font-size: 8pt\"| \"—\" denotes releases that did not chart.\n|-\n|}\n\n===Music videos===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!
