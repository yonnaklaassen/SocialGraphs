They recorded for [[RCA Records Nashville|RCA Nashville]] in the 1990s, releasing one album, an extended play, and two singles.\n\n==History==\nThe Thompson Brothers were raised in [[Norwell, Massachusetts]].<ref name=\"whitburn\"/> Andy Thompson told ''[[Country Standard Time]]'' that he gained an interest in country music after moving to an area of Massachusetts that had a country station. He, along with his brother Matt and bassist Mike Whitty, then formed a band which played at venues throughout [[New England]]. Many of the venues that they played had also hosted [[Jo Dee Messina]]. After moving to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], the band attended [[Belmont University]]. They attended a listening party held by [[RCA Records Nashville|RCA Nashville]] for [[Jon Randall]], where a friend put a demo tape of theirs in to test a [[public address]] system. After an RCA representative heard the tape, he helped them sign with the label. RCA released a six-song [[extended play]] titled ''Cows on Mainstreet'' in 1996. The album featured four studio tracks and two live recordings.<ref name=\"cst\">{{cite web|url=http://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/article.asp?xid=802|title=Thompson Brothers overcome handicap|last=Loy|first=Robert|date=September 1996|work=Country Standard Time|accessdate=11 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n''Blame It on the Dog'', the band's first full album, followed in 1998.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/1998/03/20/the-crazy-antics-of-the-thompson-brothers/|title=The Crazy Antics Of The Thompson Brothers|last=Hurst|first=Jack|date=March 20, 1998|work=[[The Chicago Tribune]]|access-date=11 November 2012}}</ref> RCA promoted the album to radio stations by shipping out a \"cool disc\" containing four songs from it.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Price|first=Deborah Evans|date=December 20, 1997|title=RCA's Thompson Brothers Have Drive to Score at Radio|magazine=Billboard|volume=109|issue=51|pages=25, 27|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4wkEAAAAMBAJ&dq=%22thompson+brothers+band%22&pg=PA25}}</ref> ''Blame It on the Dog'' produced the singles \"Drive Me Crazy\" and \"Back on the Farm\".<ref name=\"whitburn\">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2008|publisher=Record Research, Inc|date=2008|page=419|isbn=978-0-89820-177-2}}</ref> The band produced the album with [[Bill Lloyd (country musician)|Bill Lloyd]] of [[Foster & Lloyd]].
