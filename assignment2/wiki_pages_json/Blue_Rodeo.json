They put together several bands without commercial success in the late 1970s, releasing a single as Hi-Fi's in 1980.\n\nCuddy and Keelor moved to [[New York City]] in the early 1980s to further their music careers. There, they met keyboardist and fellow Canadian [[Bob Wiseman]], who, at that time, was working as a producer. Upon returning to [[Toronto]] in the summer of 1984, the trio decided to form a band. The name \"Blue Rodeo\" had already been chosen for the new group when they met former [[David Wilcox (Canadian musician)|David Wilcox]] drummer [[Cleave Anderson]] and asked him to join. Anderson, in turn, recommended his former bandmate in The Sharks, bassist Bazil Donovan, and the new band's lineup was essentially set.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.bluerodeo.com/people/biography/JimCuddy.aspx| title=Jim Cuddy Biography| work=Official Community of Blue Rodeo| access-date=May 14, 2008| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512092840/http://www.bluerodeo.com/people/biography/JimCuddy.aspx| archive-date=May 12, 2008| df=mdy-all}}</ref> On February 7, 1985, Blue Rodeo played their first show together at [[The Rivoli]] in Toronto;<ref>Schneider, Jason [http://www.exclaim.ca/articles/multiarticlesub.aspx?csid1=139&csid2=9&fid1=42671 Timeline: Blue Rodeo: Better Off as We Are]{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} at ''[[Exclaim!]]'' December 2009.</ref> one week later, they performed at [[Handsome Ned]]'s \"Honky Tonk Heart.\"<ref>\"The birth of Blue Rodeo.\" ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', November 16, 2004.</ref>\n\nThe band quickly earned a following in Toronto and was subsequently signed to Canadian independent record label Risque Disque. They entered the studio in 1986 with [[Rush (band)|Rush]] producer [[Terry Brown (record producer)|Terry Brown]] and recorded several songs that would comprise Blue Rodeo's debut album, ''[[Outskirts (album)|Outskirts]]''. Released in March 1987, ''Outskirts'' met with moderate success in Canada until \"[[Try (Blue Rodeo song)|Try]]\" was released as a single in October of that year. The single was an immediate hit, going to number one on the ''RPM Country Tracks'' chart and number six on the ''RPM Top Singles'' chart, establishing Blue Rodeo as one of Canada's top new bands and carrying ''Outskirts'' to 4× Platinum status in sales. The music video for the single featured Keelor's then-girlfriend [[Michelle McAdorey]], who soon had success with her own band, [[Crash Vegas]].\n\nIn 1992, the band's song \"After the Rain,\" written by Cuddy and Keelor, was the most-performed song in Canada.<ref name=\"Inc.1992\">{{cite magazine|author=Larry LeBlanc|title='Do it for you' does it at the SOCAN Awards|magazine=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QhAEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA48|date=14 November 1992|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|pages=48–|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> By 1999 the band had sold more than two million albums in Canada.<ref name=\"Inc.1999\">{{cite magazine|author=Bettsy Powell|title=There's no place like home|magazine=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TQ0EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA58|date=January 16, 1999|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|pages=50 and 58|issn=0006-2510}}</ref>\n\nCuddy, Keelor, Donovan, Boguski and Cripps have all released solo albums.
