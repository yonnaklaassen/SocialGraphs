He initially recorded as a member of the band [[The Wrays]] between 1983 and 1987. He made his solo debut in 1991 as Collin Raye with the album ''[[All I Can Be]]'', which produced his first Number One hit in \"[[Love, Me]]\". ''All I Can Be'' was the first of four consecutive albums released by Raye to achieve platinum [[certification]] in the United States for sales of one million copies each. Raye maintained several Top Ten hits throughout the rest of the decade and into 2000. 2001's ''Can't Back Down'' was his first album that did not produce a Top 40 country hit, and he was dropped by his record label soon afterward. He did not record another studio album until 2005's ''Twenty Years and Change'', released on an independent label.\n\nBetween 1991 and 2007, Raye charted 30 singles on the U.S. country charts; he has also charted twice on the Adult Contemporary format as a duet partner on two [[Jim Brickman]] songs. Four of Raye's singles have reached Number One on the ''Billboard'' country music charts: 1992's \"Love, Me\" and \"In This Life\", 1995's \"My Kind of Girl\", and 1998's \"I Can Still Feel You\". He has also recorded a total of 11 studio albums, counting a Christmas album and a compilation of lullabies, in addition to releasing a Greatest Hits compilation, a live album, and a live CD/DVD package.\n\n==Early years==\nFloyd Elliot Wray was born in [[De Queen, Arkansas]].
