By 2007 they had enough of a following to pursue music full-time. During this period, the Rupp brothers and Atwood formed the core of the group, with Atwood singing lead tenor. Other members of the group came and went. Current member Rob Lundquist, another Minnesotan, joined in 2008.<ref name=vitug>{{cite web | last=Vitug | first=Joseph | url=http://josephvitug.wordpress.com/2013/12/29/the-sing-off-season-4-champions-home-free-country-tonix-part-1-evolution/ | title=Country-Tonix, Part 1, Evolution | date=December 29, 2013 | access-date=January 16, 2013 | archive-date=January 28, 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140128031744/http://josephvitug.wordpress.com/2013/12/29/the-sing-off-season-4-champions-home-free-country-tonix-part-1-evolution/ | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nFor much of the group's history they worked with many talented bass singers, but did not have a full-time committed bass voice. In 2007 Chris Foss sang with them. Elliott Robinson was added as bass in September 2008, and was replaced in June 2009 by Troy Horne. Later that year, Horne left to rejoin [[the House Jacks]]. To replace Horne they turned to Tim Foust, who first sang with them as a guest on their 2010 tour. A Texas native, Foust was then pursuing a career as a singer/songwriter of country music and had recently released a solo album, but was not ready to sign on full-time. Matthew Tuey sang with the group in the interim of 2011, until Foust joined them full-time in January 2012.<ref name=vitug />\n\nIn 2012, Austin Brown was working on a [[Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.|Royal Caribbean]] cruise ship as a featured singer in their production shows. When Home Free joined the cruise as a guest performing group, they met and became close. Brown, who was born in [[Tifton, Georgia]], let Home Free know that he would be interested in joining the group if they ever had an opening. At the end of 2012 lead singer Matt Atwood and his wife, who had married the previous year, were expecting their first child. Finding the group's touring schedule incompatible with family life, and having an opportunity to take over his family's real estate business in Mankato, Atwood made the decision to retire from the group. Home Free then invited Brown to join as lead tenor. He sang his first show with the group in October 2012, and became full-time in January 2013.<ref name=ginger>{{cite AV media | title=T-Time with Ginger | medium=interview with Austin Brown | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oz1vVztUGl0 | date=December 23, 2013 | access-date=January 16, 2014 | archive-date=January 14, 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140114124028/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oz1vVztUGl0&gl=US&hl=en | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe group, made up of Chris and Adam Rupp, Lundquist, Foust and Brown, competed in and won the fourth season of ''The Sing-Off'', recording their performances in September 2013.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news |last=Bream |first=Jon |date=March 16, 2014 |title=Harmonic convergence: Minnesota vocal group Home Free makes bid for national stardom |work=Minneapolis [[Star Tribune]] |url=https://www.startribune.com/minn-vocal-group-home-free-makes-bid-for-national-stardom/250244011/?refresh=true |access-date=November 6, 2022}}</ref> During that time, the group arranged for substitute performers to fulfill their previously-scheduled concert commitments.<ref name=\":1\" /> The series was televised in December 2013, and the group headlined the Sing-Off tour across 32 cities in 2014.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nOn March 18, 2016, it was announced that, after sixteen years of performing with the group, co-founder Chris Rupp would be leaving to pursue a solo career.

Lundquist and the Rupp brothers all have bachelor's degrees in music. Adam Rupp's primary instrument is trumpet, but he also plays drums, keyboard, and bass guitar. Since joining, Foust and Brown have also become very active in writing and arranging.\n\nIn terms of musical roles, Home Free includes a lead tenor (Lundquist), a high tenor (Bell-Bastien), a [[baritone]] (Chance), a [[Bass (voice type)|bass]] (Foust), and a [[beatboxer]] (Rupp), who provides percussive sounds. Lundquist and Chance sing traditional tenor and baritone harmony, respectively, and Foust sings bass with the range of a [[basso profundo]]. Former high tenor Austin Brown is commonly known by his high notes, being compared with singers like [[Mitch Grassi]] from [[Pentatonix]], as he has a light-lyric tenor range. Foust is known for his extensive five-octave vocal range and his usage of the [[Death growl|growl technique]]. Occasionally, Foust and Chance switch roles, as Chance was the former bass of [[Street Corner Symphony (group)|Street Corner Symphony]]. All of the singers occasionally sing solos supported by the harmonies of the other singers.\n\nHome Free's styling as a country group is relatively recent. Before Foust joined the group, Home Free was an all-purpose a cappella group, singing in a wide variety of styles, of which country was only a minor one. With the additions of Foust and Brown, the group moved more in the direction of country and found that audiences responded well to it. Home Free had auditioned three times for ''The Sing-Off'' (without Foust and Brown) and not been accepted. When auditioning for the [[The Sing-Off (season 4)|fourth season]], they made a conscious decision to style themselves as a country group. In an interview Brown said this identity is what grabbed the attention of ''The Sing-Off''’s casting director, who said, “You guys really fit something we don’t have.”<ref name=ginger />\n\n==Collaborations==\nHome Free has collaborated with many notable artists.
