In the 1970s, he played bass in a local band called Freddy Morrison & the Bandana Blues, and had a minor songwriting success with [[Randy Cornor]]'s hit \"Heart Don't Fail Me Now\".<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> By 1986, Jones had also written \"[[Living in the Promiseland]]\", a No.&nbsp;1 single on the [[Hot Country Songs]] charts for [[Willie Nelson]]. He also recorded the song's demo and played all but one instrument on it.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> Nelson also recorded another one of Jones's songs, \"When Times Were Good\", with [[Merle Haggard]] on their 1987 duet album ''Seashores of Old Mexico''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.outlawmagazine.com/2013/09/19/a-conversation-with-david-lynn-jones/|title=A Conversation With David Lynn Jones|date=March 19, 2013|work=Outlaw Magazine|accessdate=May 26, 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[Mercury Records]] signed Jones in 1987 and released his debut album ''[[Hard Times on Easy Street]]'' that year. The album included ten tracks, all written by Jones. Lead single \"[[Bonnie Jean (Little Sister)]]\" charted at No.&nbsp;10 on Hot Country Songs. Three more singles made the charts: \"High Ridin' Heroes\" (a duet with [[Waylon Jennings]]), \"The Rogue\", and \"Tonight in America\".<ref name=\"whitburn\"/> Jones wrote all ten of the songs on the album, including his own rendition of \"Living in the Promiseland\", and co-produced it with Richie Albright and [[Mick Ronson]].<ref name=\"liner\">{{Cite AV media notes |title=Hard Times on Easy Street |others=David Lynn Jones |year=1987 |type=LP jacket |publisher=Mercury Records |id=832 518 1}}</ref>\n\nA second album, ''Wood, Wind and Stone'', followed in 1990. This album featured a more pop music oriented sound than its predecessor.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> He also recorded two albums for [[Liberty Records]]: ''Mixed Emotions'' in 1992 and ''Play by Ear'' two years later.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> By the end of the decade, he worked as a writer for Blue Water Music, in addition to running a recording studio in Bexar.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/>\n\nJones was the victim of a case of [[identity theft]] in the early 2000s, which made releasing additional albums difficult for fear that any royalty checks would be stolen by the perpetrators.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gypsyscholarship.blogspot.com/2009/03/david-lynn-jones-real-one.html|title=David Lynn Jones . . . the real one|date=March 21, 2009|work=Batesville Daily Guard |accessdate=December 12, 2017}}</ref> In 2017 Jones won a $2.1&nbsp;million judgment against a local bank after the jury found that the bank had sold the master tapes to over 100 of his songs and recording equipment \"without permission or cause\" at a public auction.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ozarkradionews.com/local-news/musician-wins-2-million-judgement-against-local-bank|title=Musician wins $2 million judgement against local bank|date=April 4, 2017|work=Ozark Radio News|accessdate=December 12, 2017|archive-date=April 13, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190413185734/https://www.ozarkradionews.com/local-news/musician-wins-2-million-judgement-against-local-bank|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Musical styles and reception==\nJones cited [[Waylon Jennings]] and [[Kris Kristofferson]] as his main musical influences.
