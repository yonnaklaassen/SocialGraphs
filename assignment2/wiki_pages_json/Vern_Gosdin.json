Gosdin and two brothers sang gospel on [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]] radio station [[WJOX (AM)|WVOK]].<ref name=\"jw1-575\"/> Gosdin later moved to [[Chicago, Illinois]], where he operated the D&G Tap. He idolized [[The Louvin Brothers]] and [[The Blue Sky Boys]] as a young man.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\n===1960s: West Coast Country music movement===\nIn 1961, Gosdin moved to California, where he joined the West Coast Country music movement, first as a member of the Golden State Boys,<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> which became [[The Hillmen]], and included [[Chris Hillman]].<ref name=\"jw1-575\"/> Gosdin then formed The Gosdin Brothers with brother Rex. The duo appeared on the charts in the late 1960s with a song titled \"Hangin' On\" on the Bakersfield International label, then with \"Till The End\" on Capitol Records. During the same time period, the Gosdin Brothers were featured on Hillman's former [[Byrds]] mate [[Gene Clark]]'s first solo album, the 1967 well-regarded ''[[Gene Clark with the Gosdin Brothers]]'',<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\" /> singing backing vocals on all of the tracks behind the lead vocals of Clark and lead guitars of Clarence White, Glen Campbell, and Bill Rinehart (later of the Merry-Go-Round).\n\n===1970s: Retirement and comeback===\nGosdin retired from performing during the 1970s and moved to Cartersville, Georgia, where he operated a glass company.<ref name=\"jw1-575\"/> In 1976, he signed with [[Elektra Records]] and his first hit was a remake of \"Hangin' On\", which featured [[Emmylou Harris]] on harmony vocals and peaked at No.&nbsp;16.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> His next single, \"Yesterday's Gone\" written by Wayne Hinsen Bradford who also wrote for Emmylou Harris, which also featured Harris, became his first Top 10 hit in 1977.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> Several more hits followed between 1977 and 1979 with the biggest of these hits being a remake of \"Till the End\" and a cover of [[The Association]]'s \"[[Never My Love]]\" which also featured harmony vocals from [[Janie Frickie]].<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/>\n\n===1981–1983: \"Today My World Slipped Away\"===\nIn 1981, Gosdin signed with [[Ovation Records]] and scored a Top 10 hit with \"Dream of Me\". After Ovation Records closed their doors later in 1981, Gosdin signed with A.M.I. Records where he scored a Top 10 hit in 1982 with \"Today My World Slipped Away\". (This song later became a number-three hit for [[George Strait]]).\n\nIn January 1982, during a trial that examined the attempted assassination of music producer [[Gary S. Paxton]], Darryl C. Langley claimed under oath that he and his cohort were hired attackers employed by Gosdin, who worked closely with Paxton and was alleged to be disgruntled in their working relationship. Gosdin was never arrested or charged and repeatedly refused to confirm or deny involvement for the remainder of his life.\n\nGosdin signed with Complete Records in the early 1980s, and, in 1984, released ''There Is A Season'', picked by the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' as best country album of the year.\nThe early 1980s also found a great combination of talent as Gosdin traveled from coast to coast opening shows for George Jones.\n\n===1983–1985: \"If You're Gonna Do Me Wrong (Do It Right)\"' and ''There Is a Season''===\nGosdin made the top 10 consistently in the early 1980s, really hitting his stride when he teamed with Barnes as a songwriting collaborator. The pair specialized in songs of cheating and barroom romance, often delivering an over-the-top emotionalism that got Gosdin compared to [[George Jones]].<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> In 1983, Gosdin had two top 5 hits — \"If You're Gonna Do Me Wrong (Do It Right)\" and \"Way Down Deep\" with the former earning him a nomination for the [[Grammy Award for Best Male Country Vocal Performance|Grammy Award for Best Country Vocal Performance, Male.]] The following year, he had his first No.&nbsp;1 single with \"I Can Tell by the Way You Dance (You're Gonna Love Me Tonight)\",<ref name=\"jw40\"/> which had previously been recorded by [[Gary Morris]].<ref name=\"jw1-575\"/> On September 22, 1985, Gosdin appeared at the original Farm Aid concert at the University of Illinois' Memorial Stadium.\n\n===1987–1989: \"Chiseled in Stone\"===\nAfter Compleat Records went bankrupt, Gosdin signed with Columbia in 1987. He immediately had success with \"Do You Believe Me Now\", and scored another No.&nbsp;1 hit with a tribute to [[Ernest Tubb]] called \"Set 'Em Up Joe\".<ref name=\"jw40\"/> Gosdin's \"[[Chiseled in Stone]]\", co-written with Barnes, won the Country Music Association's Song of the Year award in 1989 and earned them a nomination for the [[Grammy Award for Best Country Song]].\n\n===1989–1990: ''Alone''===\nGosdin's 1989 album, ''Alone'', was a concept album in a traditional country style. It chronicled the dissolution of Gosdin's marriage and included his final number-one hit: \"I'm Still Crazy\".<ref name=\"jw40\"/> From 1989 to 1991, he released a number of songs and three more made the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' top 10: \"Right in the Wrong Direction\", \"That Just About Does It\" and \"Is It Raining at Your House\". \"Raining\" has been covered by [[Brad Paisley]] and [[Lorrie Morgan]], and \"That Just About Does It\" by [[Willie Nelson]].\n\n===Later years===\nGosdin suffered a stroke in 1998, but he continued writing and singing up until his death. In 2009, Gosdin collaborated with Joe Sins of the country music duo The Sins to write and record his final four songs.\n\n==Death==\nGosdin suffered another stroke in early April 2009, and died at a Nashville hospital on the evening of April 28 at the age of 74.<ref name=\"Obit\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/1610248/singer-songwriter-vern-gosdin-dies-in-nashville-at-age-74/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150510233623/http://www.cmt.com/news/1610248/singer-songwriter-vern-gosdin-dies-in-nashville-at-age-74/|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 10, 2015|title=Singer-Songwriter Vern Gosdin Dies in Nashville at Age 74|first=Calvin|last=Gilbert|website=CMT News|access-date=August 7, 2021}}</ref> His remains were buried at [[Mount Olivet Cemetery (Nashville)|Mount Olivet Cemetery]] in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\n==Discography==\n{{main|Vern Gosdin discography}}\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n=== Grammy Awards ===\n\n{{awards table}}\n|-\n|[[26th Grammy Awards|1984]]\n|\"[[If You're Gonna Do Me Wrong (Do It Right)]]\"\n|[[Grammy Award for Best Male Country Vocal Performance|Best Male Country Vocal Performance]]\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|[[31st Grammy Awards|1989]]\n|\"[[Chiseled in Stone]]\"\n|[[Grammy Award for Best Country Song|Best Country Song]]\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|}\n\n=== Academy of Country Music Awards ===\n\n{{awards table}}\n|-\n|[[13th Academy of Country Music Awards|1978]]\n|Vern Gosdin\n|[[Academy of Country Music Award for New Male Artist of the Year|Top New Male Vocalist]]\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|rowspan=2| [[24th Academy of Country Music Awards|1989]]\n|\"[[Set 'Em Up Joe]]\"\n|Song of the Year\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|''[[Chiseled in Stone (album)|Chiseled in Stone]]''\n|[[Academy of Country Music Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]]\n|{{nom}}\n|}\n\n=== Country Music Association Awards ===\n\n{{awards table}}\n|-\n|rowspan=2| [[1983 Country Music Association Awards|1983]]\n|Vern Gosdin\n|[[Country Music Association Award for New Artist of the Year|Horizon Award]]\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|\"[[If You're Gonna Do Me Wrong (Do It Right)]]\"\n|[[Country Music Association Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]]\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|[[1984 Country Music Association Awards|1984]]\n|rowspan=2| Vern Gosdin\n|Horizon Award\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|rowspan=2| [[1988 Country Music Association Awards|1988]]\n|[[Country Music Association Award for Male Vocalist of the Year|Male Vocalist of the Year]]\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|''[[Chiseled in Stone (album)|Chiseled in Stone]]''\n|Album of the Year\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|rowspan=2| [[1989 Country Music Association Awards|1989]]\n|rowspan=2| \"[[Chiseled in Stone]]\"\n|[[Country Music Association Award for Single of the Year|Single of the Year]]\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|Song of the Year\n|{{won}}\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Hines, Geoffrey (1998). \"Vern Gosdin\".
