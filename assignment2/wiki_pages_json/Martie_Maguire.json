She won awards in national fiddle championships while still a teenager. Maguire is accomplished on several other instruments, including the mandolin, viola, double bass and guitar. She has written and co-written a number of the band's songs, some of which have become chart-topping hits. She also contributes her skills in vocal harmony and backing vocals, as well as orchestrating string arrangements for the band.\n\nMaguire learned several instruments at a young age, honing her skills with her younger sister, [[Emily Strayer]] (born Emily Erwin) and two schoolmates (a brother and sister team, Troy and [[Sharon Gilchrist]]) for over five years as a part of a touring bluegrass quartet while in high school. After graduation, the sisters forged an alliance with two other women they had met through the Dallas music scene, [[Laura Lynch (musician)|Laura Lynch]] and Robin Lynn Macy, forming a bluegrass and country music band, [[busking]] and touring the bluegrass festival circuits for six years. After the departure of Macy, and the replacement of Lynch with singer [[Natalie Maines]], the band widened their musical repertoire and appearance. The result was a trio so commercially successful that it took the country music industry by surprise, with 19 singles hitting the [[Hot Country Songs|Billboard Country Charts]], 2 Diamond Albums, 2 Platinum albums, and 13 [[Grammy Awards]].  Maguire subsequently stood by her bandmates as they were engulfed in a 2003 controversy for [[Dixie Chicks controversy|criticizing George W. Bush]], which led to the Chicks being [[blacklisted]] by many country radio stations.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Tyrangiel |first1=Josh |title=Chicks in the Line of Fire |url=https://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,1196419,00.html |access-date=October 5, 2022 |publisher=Time Magazine |date=May 21, 2006}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nMartha Elenor Erwin, nicknamed Martie, was born October 12, 1969, in [[York, Pennsylvania]].<ref name=\"TV guide\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/martie-maguire/256027 |title=Martie Maguire News, Martie Maguire Bio and Photos |publisher=TVGuide.com |access-date=2014-07-15}}</ref>\n\nEncouraged by her parents &ndash; educators at private schools &ndash; Maguire began playing violin at age five, and by age 12, started to learn to play \"[[fiddle]] style\" after receiving a birthday gift of fiddle lessons.<ref name=\"Ladies Home Journal\">[http://www.lhj.com/lhj/story.jhtml?storyid=/templatedata/lhj/story/data/martiemaguirecelebprofile_01132003.xml]{{dead link|date=July 2014}}</ref> She also was active in her school orchestra.<ref name=\"Gilchriest\">[http://www.freewebs.com/originalchicks/newsarchive.htm]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219045902/http://www.freewebs.com/originalchicks/newsarchive.htm|date=December 19, 2007}}</ref>\n\nHer sister Emily shared her love and interest in music, and displayed early talent herself.
