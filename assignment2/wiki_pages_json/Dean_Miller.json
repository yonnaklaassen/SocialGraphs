Another single, \"Wake Up and Smell the Whiskey\", was co-written and previously recorded by [[Brett James]], who would later become a popular Nashville songwriter in the 2000s. Miller parted ways with Capitol not long afterward.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> In 2000, two country artists charted with singles that Miller co-wrote: [[Terri Clark]]'s \"[[A Little Gasoline]]\" and [[Trace Adkins]]'s \"I'm Gonna Love You Anyway\".\n\nIn 2002, Miller signed to the newly formed [[Universal South Records]], where he recorded his second album, ''Just Me''.
