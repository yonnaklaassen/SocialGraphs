From 1992 to 1998, he was a member of the country band [[Lonestar]], in which he played bass guitar and alternated with [[Richie McDonald]] as lead vocalist.

In 2001, he self-released ''Rescue Me'', an album he was inspired to record by a cancer patient named Katie Darnell.  By 2003, he joined [[Big Kenny]] to form the duo [[Big & Rich]], who released three albums on [[Warner Bros. Records]] as well as ten singles, including the Number One \"[[Lost in This Moment]]\". After Big & Rich went on hiatus in 2007, Rich began work on a third solo album, ''[[Son of a Preacher Man (John Rich album)|Son of a Preacher Man]]'', which has produced two more chart singles. In 2011, Rich released two extended plays, ''[[Rich Rocks]]'' and ''[[For the Kids (EP)|For the Kids]]'', before re-establishing Big & Rich in 2012.\n\n==Music career==\n\n===Lonestar===\n{{Main|Lonestar}}\nJohn Rich was born on January 7, 1974, in [[Amarillo, Texas]],<ref>{{Cite web |title=John Rich Biography, Songs, & Albums |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/john-rich-mn0000233467/biography |access-date=August 22, 2023 |website=AllMusic |language=en}}</ref> the son of Jim, a Baptist preacher, and Judy Overton Rich.
