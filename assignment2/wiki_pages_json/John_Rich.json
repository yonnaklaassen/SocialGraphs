In 2001, he self-released ''Rescue Me'', an album he was inspired to record by a cancer patient named Katie Darnell.  By 2003, he joined [[Big Kenny]] to form the duo [[Big & Rich]], who released three albums on [[Warner Bros. Records]] as well as ten singles, including the Number One \"[[Lost in This Moment]]\". After Big & Rich went on hiatus in 2007, Rich began work on a third solo album, ''[[Son of a Preacher Man (John Rich album)|Son of a Preacher Man]]'', which has produced two more chart singles.
