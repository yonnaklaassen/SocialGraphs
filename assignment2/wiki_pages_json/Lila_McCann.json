She signed to the independent [[Broken Bow Records]] label in 2005, releasing five singles for the label before being dropped in 2008. Overall, she has charted twelve singles on the ''Billboard'' country charts, with the highest-peaking being 1998's \"I Wanna Fall in Love\" at No.&nbsp;3. Her second-highest peaking single, 1999's \"With You\", which reached No.&nbsp;9 on the country charts and No.&nbsp;41 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], her only entry on the latter chart.\n\n==Biography==\nLila Elaine McCann was born in [[Puyallup, Washington]]. She gave her first public performance at age four, when she sang \"[[You Are My Sunshine]]\" in her father's country music band. Later on, she became a local performer in her own right, singing in small venues around her hometown.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> By the time she was in her early teens, McCann recorded \"Down Came a Blackbird\", a song which was given to her by her manager, Kasey Walker. McCann's version of the song was sent to Seymour Stein, president of the [[Asylum Records]] label, who signed her to a recording contract in 1997.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/>\n\n==Career==\n{{Moresources|date=April 2024}}\n===1997-1998: ''Lila''===\n\"Down Came a Blackbird\" was issued in mid-1997 as the first single from her debut album, ''[[Lila (album)|Lila]]''; the song went on to peak at No.&nbsp;28 on the ''Billboard'' country charts. Released in June 1997, ''Lila'' drew critical acclaim and comparisons to [[LeAnn Rimes]]. These comparisons stemmed from the fact that both singers, who were teenagers at the time, were recording material that was considered mature for their age.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/><ref name=\"closer\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1444821/20010627/lila_mccann.jhtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116054206/http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1444821/20010627/lila_mccann.jhtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 16, 2009 |title=Lila McCann \"Comes a Little Closer\" to Adulthood |accessdate=2007-12-10 |date=2001-06-28 |work=CMT.com}}</ref> ''Lila'' was also the highest-selling album for a new country music act that year,<ref name=\"highest\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1474080/20030717/lila_mccann.jhtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116053623/http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1474080/20030717/lila_mccann.jhtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 16, 2009 |title= Lila Big Seller For '97 |accessdate=2007-12-10 |date=1998-01-04 |work=CMT.com}}</ref> earning platinum certification in the United States for shipments of one million copies. \"I Wanna Fall in Love\", the album's second single, became McCann's highest-charting single at No.&nbsp;3 on the US country charts and No.&nbsp;1 on the Canadian country charts. However, the third and fourth singles (a cover of [[Sheena Easton]]'s \"Almost Over You\" and the [[Mark Spiro]]-[[Andrew Gold]] collaboration \"Yippy Ky Yay\", respectively) failed to make Top 40 in the US, although the former was a No.&nbsp;38 in Canada. Later in 1998, McCann recorded a song titled \"To Get Me to You\" for the [[Hope Floats (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] to the movie ''[[Hope Floats]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1475332/20030804/lila_mccann.jhtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116054209/http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1475332/20030804/lila_mccann.jhtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 16, 2009 |title=Lila Floats On |accessdate=2007-12-10 |date=1998-08-11 |work=CMT.com}}</ref> This song was released to radio, although it did not chart.\n\n===1999-2000: ''Something in the Air'' and ''Complete''===\nMcCann's second album, ''[[Something in the Air (album)|Something in the Air]]'', was issued in 1999.

This song entered Top Ten on the country music charts, and peaked at No.&nbsp;41 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], giving McCann her only entry on the latter chart. ''Something in the Air'' was certified gold in the United States; although three additional singles were released from it, none reached higher than No.&nbsp;41 on the country music charts.\n\nMcCann's third album, 2001's ''[[Complete (Lila McCann album)|Complete]]'', was issued on [[Warner Bros. Records]], due to the closure of Asylum Records's Nashville division which resulted in the transfer of Asylum's roster to the Warner Bros. label. Nineteen years old at the time of its release, McCann felt that the album marked an increased level of maturity in her work.<ref name=\"closer\"/> The first single from ''Complete'', \"Come a Little Closer\", reached a peak of No.&nbsp;43 on the country music charts. After it came \"Because of You\", which failed to chart. McCann was dropped from Warner Bros.' roster in 2002, following the release of a ''Super Hits'' compilation which was composed of material from her previous albums.\n\n===2005-2008: Switch to Broken Bow===\nOn November 20, 2005, McCann married her boyfriend Mike Wolofsky in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1517563/20051206/lila_mccann.jhtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116054214/http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1517563/20051206/lila_mccann.jhtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 16, 2009 |title=Lila McCann Marries |accessdate=2007-12-10 |date=2005-12-06 |work=CMT.com}}</ref> Later that same year McCann signed to a new recording contract with [[Broken Bow Records]], an independent record label. Although four singles were issued on the label between 2005 and early 2006, no album was released on Broken Bow during that timespan. A fifth single for Broken Bow, titled \"That's What Angels Do\", was shipped to radio in December 2007, and entered the country music charts at No.&nbsp;60. McCann left Broken Bow Records in early 2008 and announced in October of the same year that she was expecting her and her husband's first child, Abraham Elliot (born December 15, 2008). In 2011, Lila and Mike had their second son Benjamin (born December 6, 2011), while she worked as a successful photographer, operating a photography business in the Nashville area.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.lilamccannphotography.com/ |title=Lila Mccann Photography |access-date=2014-10-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020002737/http://www.lilamccannphotography.com/ |archive-date=2014-10-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===2016-present: ''Paint This Town''===\nAt the end of 2016, she started working on a new album through a PledgeMusic campaign.
