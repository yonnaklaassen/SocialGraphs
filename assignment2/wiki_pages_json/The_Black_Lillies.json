They toured actively from 2009 until their last show on New Year's Eve 2019. Their lineup for their 2018 ''Stranger to Me'' studio album included [[Cruz Contreras]] on lead vocals, guitar, and keys, Sam Quinn (formerly of [[The Everybodyfields]]) on bass and vocals, Bowman Townsend on drums, and Dustin Schaefer on electric guitar and vocals.\n\n==Background==\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2018}}\nThe band's debut album, ''Whiskey Angel'', was recorded in Cruz's living room and released in April 2009.  It featured [[Billy Contreras]] on fiddle, [[Taylor Coker]] on bass, and [[Leah Gardner]] on backing vocals. Contreras wrote and arranged all of the songs on the album.  It is personal material, covering the fallout of his [[divorce]] from [[Robinella]] and the break up of the band they shared.  The album resonated strongly with listeners, and ''Whiskey Angel'' was ranked in several 'Best of 2009' lists in publications across the country. After ''Whiskey Angel'', they released their album, ''Black Lillies''.\n\nThe Black Lillies made an immediate impact on Knoxville's growing music scene and the band was selected to play the [[Bonnaroo Music & Arts Festival]] within weeks of releasing the album.  They quickly signed a management and booking deal with Chyna Brackeen of Attack Monkey Productions and in October of that year, they launched their first national tour.  The tour kicked off at the [[Ryman Auditorium]] and the band played 38 shows in 40 days. Two additional national tours took place in 2010 and included appearances at festivals including Bristol's [[Rhythm & Roots Reunion]], [[Pickathon]], [[Four Corners Folk Festival]], [[Pagosa Folk & Bluegrass]], and [[Rhythm & Blooms]].  The band has been ranked as the \"Best Americana Band\" in the [[Metro Pulse]] Best of Knoxville poll every year since their inception.<ref name=hodges>{{cite web|author=Carey Hodges |url=http://www.metropulse.com/news/2010/may/12/best-americana-band-black-lillies/ |title=Best Americana Band: The Black Lillies |publisher=Metro Pulse |date=2010-05-12 |accessdate=2014-07-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715104245/http://www.metropulse.com/news/2010/may/12/best-americana-band-black-lillies/ |archivedate=July 15, 2014 }}</ref>  They have appeared multiple times on live radio shows including The [[Grand Ole Opry]], NPR's [[Mountain Stage]], [[WDVX]]'s Tennessee Shines and Music City Roots.  In 2010, they were the first band selected and announced to participate in the [[Americana Music Festival & Conference|Americana Music Association's Festival & Conference]] - their selection was announced  two months prior to the rest of the line up.  They have since returned several times.\n\nIn January 2010, their album ''Whiskey Angel'' was nominated for The 10th Annual Independent Music Awards for the Americana Album Category. The album was selected to receive the IMA Vox Pop award.<ref name=hodges />  \"Two Hearts Down\" was awarded the 2012 Independent Music Award for Best Story Song.<ref>[http://www.independentmusicawards.com/ima/2012/11th-annual-independent-music-awards-winners-announced/ \"11th Annual Independent Music Awards Winners Announced!\"] Independent Music Awards, 2 May 2012.

The project was entirely fan-funded via [[sponsorship]] packages sold through the band website.  The final funds needed were raised through a [[house concert]] that drew more than 300 people.  The national radio release of the album ''100 Miles Of Wreckage'' was on April 4, 2011. ''100 Miles of Wreckage'' gained national attention and peaked at No. 11 on the Americana radio charts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.americanaradio.org/ama/displaychart_beforetracks.asp?mode=lw&dtkey= |title=Last Week AMA Chart |publisher=Americanaradio.org |date=2014-07-07 |accessdate=2014-07-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140731182008/http://americanaradio.org/AMA/displaychart_beforetracks.asp?mode=lw&dtkey= |archivedate=2014-07-31 }}</ref> David McClister  selected the album's first track, \"Two Hearts Down,\" as his project. The video was filmed in June 2011 in Nashville. The video made its world premiere on CMT in October 2011 and immediately became a viewer favorite, spending multiple weeks in the \"CMT Pure 12 Pack Countdown\" including several weeks in the number 2 spot. It was a contender for the top 30 videos of the year on CMT.  Additionally, the video aired on networks worldwide including international MTV and VH-1 affiliates, TCN, and PBC.\n\nAdditionally, the band was selected to perform at the Country Music Association's Festival & Fan Fair that year.  The Black Lillies made their debut performance on the [[Grand Ole Opry]] on June 17, 2011.  The band was the first independent artist from the Knoxville area to be featured on the Grand Ole Opry, and made history again by being invited back multiple times, appearing five times in just four months. They have since appeared on the show more than 35 times, a record for an independent act.\n\nThe Black Lillies' third album, ''Runaway Freeway Blues'', was released in March 2013 to widespread critical acclaim. That album debuted at #21 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart and #43 on the Billboard Top 200 Country chart. It spent more than five months in the Americana Music Association's top five, ending the year as the #18 album of the year overall, based on radio airplay.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://e2.ma/message/tn5pf/1hqo2f |title=Americana Music Association Top 100 of 2013 |access-date=2014-12-28 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20141228204010/http://e2.ma/message/tn5pf/1hqo2f |archive-date=2014-12-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref> ''Runaway Freeway Blues'' was selected by more than two dozen publications (including American Songwriter magazine) as one of the best albums of the year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americansongwriter.com/2013/12/american-songwriters-top-50-albums-2013/ |title=American Songwriter: Top 50 Albums of 2013|date=4 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn June 13, 2013, the band announced via their website and Facebook page that Jamie Cook, who had been on leave from the band for several weeks already due to a family health matter, would not be returning and that Bowman Townsend, who had been filling in for Cook on tour, would be taking his place full-time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theblacklillies.com/2013/06/13/farewell-jamie/ |title=Farewell, Jamie |publisher=The Black Lillies |date=2013-06-13 |accessdate=2014-07-12}}</ref>\n\nThe band continued to tour in support of ''Runaway Freeway Blues'' throughout 2014, including stops at [[Stagecoach: California's Country Music Festival]], [[Old Settler's Music Festival]], [[Braun Brothers Reunion]], [[Bonnaroo Music & Arts Festival]], and more. In summer 2014, [[Rolling Stone Magazine]] selected them as one of the hottest up-and-coming acts in country music, calling them \"buzzworthy\" and describing their style as \"genre-mashing roots music with an Appalachian anchor.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/10-new-artists-you-need-to-know-summer-2014-20140601/the-black-lillies-0770928 |title=Rolling Stone: 10 Artists You Need to Know|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=June 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn November 2014, The Black Lillies launched a fan funding campaign via PledgeMusic for their fourth studio album, to be recorded in February 2015.

The departure was amicable and both stayed on to complete the winter tour. The remaining Black Lillies (Cruz Contreras, Bowman Townsend, and [[Trisha Gene Brady]]) headed into Nashville's House of Blues Studios in February to record their fourth album with Hewitt. They were joined by bass player Bill Reynolds from Band of Horses, pedal steel player Matt Smith (Amy Ray, [[The Honeycutters]]) and then-19-year-old Nashville guitar phenom Daniel Donato, whom Cruz had discovered playing at Robert's Western World on Nashville's Lower Broadway.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/premieres/hear-the-black-lillies-funky-hard-to-please-20150722|title=Rolling Stone: Hear The Black Lillies' funky new 'Hard to Please'|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=22 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n\"Hard to Please\" was released October 2, 2015 to immediate critical and fan acclaim.

American Songwriter summed it up as \"a soulful mix of upbeat Americana and tender ballads,\" while Vanity Fair noted that \"their sound continues to cross generations and musical genres â€“ country, folk, blues and add in a touch of the Dead, for good measure.\"\n\nBeginning with the release tour for \"Hard to Please\" the touring band was expanded to a six piece, with players Mike Seal (Jeff Sipe Trio, Larkin Poe), Megan McCormick (Jenny Lewis, Maren Morris, the everybodyfields) and Dustin Schaefer trading parts on electric guitar; Sam Quinn (the everybodyfields) on bass; and Jonathan Keeney (Robinella) on pedal steel.\n\nIn October 2016, vocalist Trisha Gene Brady announced that she would be leaving the band to pursue other musical opportunities. Her last show with the band was on Dec 31, 2016 at Knoxville, Tennessee's Mill & Mine.\n\n==Current==\n\nThe quartet spent the majority of 2017 working on new material that builds upon their foundation of strong roots rock and redefines the group's sound, with lush, layered three-part harmonies floating over the funky edge of double electric guitar and keys. Contreras and Quinn, with an occasional assist from Schaefer, have debuted rough sketches of the new material via weekly Facebook Live broadcasts from the road while on tour, dubbed \"The Sprinter Sessions.\"\n\nIn January 2018, the group began work with producer Jamie Candiloro (R.E.M., Ryan Adams and the Cardinals, The Eagles) on a new album. Recording took place at Echo Mountain Studios in Asheville, North Carolina. The album, entitled ''Stranger to Me,'' will be released fall 2018 on Thirty Tigers. \n                                                                                                                                                                                 \nOn January 26, 2020, this was on the Black Lillies website. \"After eleven years, five albums, approximately 2000 shows, and countless relationships built along the way, the time has come for us to take a step back from The Black Lillies.
