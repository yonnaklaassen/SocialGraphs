Ruttan''' (born January 27, 1972) is a Canadian [[country music]] singer, songwriter and record producer from [[Bracebridge, Ontario]], [[Canada]].  A [[Nashville, Tennessee]] resident, he has released four studio albums and has written or co-written more than 60 songs that have been recorded by other recording artists.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dericruttan.net/website/the-songwriter/ |title=The Songwriter &#124; Deric Ruttan |website=dericruttan.net |access-date=15 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531211225/http://dericruttan.net/website/the-songwriter/ |archive-date=31 May 2014 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Breakthrough==\nDeric moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] in 1994 to pursue his music career, spending his days writing songs and his nights scouring the city getting ideas and learning from local singer-songwriters. He got his break in 1999 when producer Steve Bogard heard one of Deric's tapes and liked it. Steve signed Deric to a songwriting deal and immediately began recording his first demos. After Doug Howard at [[Lyric Street Records]] heard his demo and Deric played five songs live for Randy Goodman, Deric entered a record deal with the label. In 2003, he released his debut album, ''Deric Ruttan''.<ref>\"Canadians in Nashville\", ''Words and Music'', Fall 2010</ref>\n\n==Songwriting==\nIn 2003, just as his first single \"When You Come Around,\" was released, he celebrated his first No.&nbsp;1 as a songwriter when friend and collaborator [[Dierks Bentley]] took the Ruttan/Bentley/Brett Beavers co-write \"[[What Was I Thinkin']]\" to the top of the charts in the US. The song helped set Bentley on the path to country stardom. (To date, Bentley has recorded six Ruttan co-writes, including the 2005 chart-topper Lot of Leavin' Left To Do.) In 2004 Ruttan's \"My Way\", recorded by [[Aaron Pritchett]], was the most-played Canadian country song of that year. Capitol Nashville's [[Eric Church]] had an American Billboard hit with his and Ruttan's \"[[Guys Like Me]]\" in 2007, and cuts on other acts followed, on artists like [[Gary Allan]], [[Paul Brandt]], [[Doc Walker]], [[Jason Blaine]], and [[The Higgins]].<ref name=\"derric\">work={{cite web |url=http://www.dericruttan.net/biography.php |title=Deric Ruttan - Biography |access-date=July 22, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718144852/http://dericruttan.net/biography.php |archive-date=July 18, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nIn September 2007, Ruttan was awarded his first [[Canadian Country Music Award]] (CCMA) for Songwriter of the Year (along with co-writers [[Aaron Pritchett]] and [[Mitch Merrett]]), for \"Hold My Beer\", recorded by Pritchett.<ref name=\"cmt\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cmt.ca/cmthitlisttour/deric-ruttan/ |title=Deric Ruttan |location=CA |publisher=CMT.ca |access-date=April 10, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504114821/http://www.cmt.ca/cmthitlisttour/deric-ruttan/ |archive-date=May 4, 2012 }}</ref> He won the CCMA for songwriter of the year once again in 2014 for \"[[Mine Would Be You]],\" recorded by [[Blake Shelton]].\n\nRuttan has written and co-written songs for prominent country musicians including [[Dierks Bentley]] (\"[[What Was I Thinkin']]\" and \"[[Lot of Leavin' Left to Do]]\"), [[Aaron Pritchett]] (\"[[Hold My Beer (Aaron Pritchett song)|Hold My Beer]]\" and \"My Way\"), [[Jason Aldean]] (\"Any Ol' Barstool\"), [[Eric Church]] (\"[[Guys Like Me]]\" and \"[[Hell on the Heart]]\"), and [[Blake Shelton]] (\"[[Mine Would Be You]]\" and \"[[Came Here to Forget]]\").\n\nSince 2011, Deric has written for Nashville-based publishing company THiS Music. He renewed his deal with THiS Music in 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://musicrow.com/2016/03/this-music-renews-publishing-deal-with-songwriter-deric-ruttan/|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180228041648/https://musicrow.com/2016/03/this-music-renews-publishing-deal-with-songwriter-deric-ruttan/|archive-date = February 28, 2018|title = THiS Music Renews Publishing Deal with Songwriter Deric Ruttan|date = March 25, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==As a recording artist==\nIt took over four years for Ruttan to follow up his 2003 self-titled release. In 2008 he released his second album, aptly titled First Time in a Long Time, which yielded four hit radio singles at Canadian country radio: the title track, \"Lovin' You Is Killin' Me\", \"California Plates\" (co-written with members of Manitoba country band Doc Walker), and \"Good Time\", a duet with Bentley. (The video for \"Good Time\" reached No.&nbsp;1 on CMT Canada's video countdown).<ref name=\"cmt\"/>\n\n\"It wasn't just that writing songs for other artists was taking time away from me writing my next record\", says Ruttan. \"It was that suddenly I was known as a guy who'd written radio hits for other acts – the bar had been raised for me, creatively, because of that. I felt the next record I made needed to be really, really good.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theagencygroup.com/artist.aspx?ArtistID=5377 |title=Archived copy |website=www.theagencygroup.com |access-date=15 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227223451/http://www.theagencygroup.com/artist.aspx?ArtistID=5377 |archive-date=27 December 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAt the 2008 [[Canadian Country Music Awards]], Ruttan earned a total of four nominations – \"Male Artist\", \"Songwriter\", \"Record Producer\", and \"Best Album,\" and closed the show performing alongside The Guess Who/Bachman Turner Overdrive guitar legend Randy Bachman. By the following year, \"First Time In A Long Time\" had garnered so much radio airplay that it earned Ruttan and co-writer Jimmy Rankin a SOCAN Country Music Award at the 2009 SOCAN Awards in Toronto.<ref name=\"cmt\"/>\n\nIn January 2010, with \"[[Sunshine (Deric Ruttan album)|Sunshine]],\" Deric began releasing albums on his own independent label, Black T Records. He captured live audio on Sunshine's supporting tour to create 2011's live album, \"[[Up All Night – Deric Ruttan Live]].\" He released his most recent album, \"[[Take the Week Off]],\" in October 2013.\n\nHe has found success as an artist on Canadian country radio, and he continues to balance touring to support his albums with songwriting at home. \"I’ve never been happier with the balance in my career,\" he says. \"I tour about as much as I’d ever want to. Jason Blaine, Chad Brownlee and I recently did 25 shows across Canada in the Your Town Throwdown tour, and I played festivals in the summer. That lets me get my performance ya-yas out, and I’m in Nashville writing the rest of the time. Considering I haven’t lived there in 20 years, I feel really embraced by Canada.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.socanmagazine.ca/features/busy-hit-songwriter-deric-ruttan/ |title=Busy hit songwriter Deric RuttanL'auteur-compositeur Deric Ruttan – SOCAN Words and Music |website=Socanmagazine.ca |date=March 6, 2014 |access-date=April 8, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!
