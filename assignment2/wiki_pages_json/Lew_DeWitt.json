He was a founding member of [[The Statler Brothers]] and the group's original [[tenor]].\n\n==Biography==\nFor most of his career, DeWitt sang tenor for The Statler Brothers. Songs he wrote for the group include \"[[Flowers on the Wall]]\"— which was a greatest hit during the late 1960s and early 1970s that made the group popular — \"Things,\" \"Since Then,\" \"Thank You World,\" \"The Strand,\" \"The Movies,\" and \"Chet Atkins' Hand.\" In 1968, while the group was under contract to [[Columbia Records]], DeWitt recorded a solo single composed of the songs \"She Went a Little Bit Farther\" and \"Brown Eyes\" (the latter was penned by DeWitt).\n\nIn November 1981, DeWitt took a leave of absence from The Statler Brothers due to surgery and treatment for [[Crohn's disease]],<ref name=randommemories>{{cite book |last1=Reid |first1=Don |last2=Reid |first2=Harold |date=2007 |title=Random Memories |location=Nashville, Tennessee |publisher=Yell Publishing Company |page=95 |isbn=978-0-9800883-0-4}}</ref>{{rp|95}} from which he had suffered since [[adolescence]]. At his suggestion, [[Jimmy Fortune]] was tapped as his temporary replacement. He  rejoined the group in June of the following year (with Fortune having been offered a permanent position in the group's backing band), but this arrangement lasted less than a week. DeWitt officially retired that same month with Fortune becoming his permanent replacement.<ref name=randommemories/>{{rp|96}}\n\nThree years later, DeWitt, feeling that his health had gradually improved through continued treatment, decided to pursue a solo career. During this time, he  returned to touring and  released two albums, ''Here to Stay'' (1984)<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1298&dat=19860726&id=4_hNAAAAIBAJ&sjid=VIsDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5683,4535062&hl=en|title=DeWitt to visit Orange fair|last=Moses|first=Ellen|date=26 July 1986|work=[[The Free Lance-Star]]|access-date=13 July 2016}}</ref> and ''On My Own'' (1985).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=GN4cAAAAIBAJ&sjid=CGMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5248,6572439&dq=lew-dewitt+on-my-own&hl=en|title=Statlers' Lew DeWitt back on his own|last=Sharpe|first=Jerry|date=8 December 1985|work=[[The Pittsburgh Press]]|access-date=26 March 2010}}</ref> The latter album gave Dewitt his only solo chart appearance with a cover of \"[[You'll Never Know]]\", which made it to number 77. Despite the lack of success, he  remained with the Compleat label through 1987.\n\nDeWitt was married three times. From 1961 through 1973, he was married to Glenda Kay Simmers, with whom he had two sons and two daughters. He was later married to Joyce Anne Arehart, and then Judy Fitzgerald Wells.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lva.virginia.gov/public/dvb/bio.asp?b=DeWitt_Lew |title=Lewis Calvin \"Lew\" DeWitt (1938–1990) |first=Jacques |last=Vest |website=Dictionary of Virginia Biography |date=2015 |accessdate=July 21, 2018}}</ref>\n\nDeWitt remained active as a performer until late 1989,<ref>{{cite news |last=Wiese |first=Cleve |date=25 March 2008 |title=Still making his mark |url=http://www.dailyprogress.com/news/still-making-his-mark/article_d94258f3-f3b9-55d5-ab71-5cc79b6dc127.html |newspaper=The Daily Progress |location=Charlottesville, Virginia |access-date=14 November 2015 }}</ref> when his health rapidly declined, which culminated in his death on August 15, 1990, in [[Waynesboro, Virginia]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/22065262/former_statler_brother_lew_dewitt_dies/ |title=Former Statler Brother Lew DeWitt dies at 52 |agency=[[Associated Press|AP]] |newspaper=[[The Des Moines Register]] |page=8 |date=August 16, 1990 |accessdate=July 21, 2018 |via=newspapers.com}}</ref> The cause of death was heart and kidney disease, stemming from complications of Crohn's.

That was until the summer of that year when most of his discography was finally released on Spotify, Apple Music, and other streaming services.\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
