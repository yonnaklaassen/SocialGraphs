September 20, 1947), daughters Becky (b. Aug. 2, 1975) and [[Sonya Isaacs]] (b. July 22, 1974) and son Ben Isaacs (b. July 25, 1972), along with John Bowman (husband of Becky Isaacs) as an instrumentalist and songwriter. Joe Isaacs, formerly a singer and banjo player in the group, has left since his 1998 divorce from Lily Isaacs. He now does solo work on a far more localized level.\n\nFormer Kingsmen Quartet bass player, lead singer and baritone Tim Surrett was a member of group from 1997 until 2002. Surrett was married to Sonya Isaacs during this time period. Thomas Wywrot was a member from 2008 to 2011. Sonya Isaacs' husband, [[Jimmy Yeary]], took his place.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.singingnews.com/Southern-Gospel-News/11655741/ |title=Jimmy Yeary Joins The Isaacs &#124; The Southern Gospel Music Magazine |publisher=SingingNews.com |date=2011-08-30 |accessdate=2012-07-06 |archive-date=2011-10-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017015300/http://www.singingnews.com/Southern-Gospel-News/11655741/ |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nCurrently, the Isaacs consists of [[Sonya Isaacs|Sonya Isaacs Yeary]], Lily Isaacs, Becky Isaacs Bowman and Ben Isaacs.

Lily's parents are [[The Holocaust in Poland|Polish Jewish Holocaust]] survivors. A few years after they were liberated from a concentration camp in Germany in 1945, her parents moved two year old Lily to New York City, where, in 1958, she got a recording contract with [[Columbia Records]] and started performing in night clubs. While performing with his Kentucky band at the [[Gerde's Folk City]], Joe met Lily and they were married in 1970. After Joe's brother died in an automobile accident, Joe and Lily became Christians, and the group began to perform only bluegrass gospel music.<ref name=\"lufkin\">{{cite news |last1=BARCLAY |first1=BRITTANY |title=The Isaacs to bring bluegrass gospel to The Pines |url=https://lufkindailynews.com/news/community/article_94d60ad4-b88c-5651-a672-7ce01b2b7c36.html |access-date=12 July 2021 |work=The Lufkin Daily News |language=en}}</ref> The group was initially named the Calvary Mountain Boys and later became Sacred Bluegrass before settling on the family name, the Isaacs.
