It consisted of Canadians [[Rick Danko]] (bass, guitar, vocals, fiddle), [[Garth Hudson]] (organ, keyboards, accordion, saxophone), [[Richard Manuel]] (piano, drums, vocals), [[Robbie Robertson]] (guitar, songwriting, vocals, piano, percussion), and American [[Levon Helm]] (drums, vocals, mandolin, guitar, bass). The Band combined elements of [[Americana (music)|Americana]], [[Folk music|folk]], rock, [[jazz]], [[country music|country]], influencing musicians such as [[George Harrison]], [[Elton John]], [[the Grateful Dead]], [[Eric Clapton]] and [[Wilco]].\n\nBetween 1958 and 1963, the group was known as the Hawks, a backing band for [[rockabilly]] singer [[Ronnie Hawkins]]. In the mid-1960s, they gained recognition for backing [[Bob Dylan]] and [[Bob Dylan World Tour 1966|the 1966 concert tour]] was notable as Dylan's first with an electric band. After leaving Dylan and changing their name to ''The Band'', they released several records to critical and popular acclaim, including their debut album ''[[Music from Big Pink]]'' in 1968. According to [[AllMusic]], the album's influence on several generations of musicians has been substantial: musician [[Roger Waters]] called ''Music from Big Pink'' the second-most influential record in the history of rock and roll,<ref>{{cite web|last=Moon|first=Tom|author-link=Tom Moon|date=June 1, 2018|url=https://www.npr.org/2018/07/01/624729592/50-years-on-the-bands-music-from-big-pink-haunts-us-still|title=50 Years On, The Band's 'Music From Big Pink' Haunts Us Still|publisher=[[NPR]]|language=en-US|access-date=December 10, 2020}}</ref> and music journalist [[Al Aronowitz]] called it \"country soul ... a sound never heard before\".<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/the-beginnings-of-the-band-getting-started-meeting-bob-dylan-and-music-from-big-pink-91781/ |url-access=subscription |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181105140956/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/the-beginnings-of-the-band-getting-started-meeting-bob-dylan-and-music-from-big-pink-91781/amp/ |archive-date=November 5, 2018 |title=The Beginnings of the Band: Getting Started, Meeting Bob Dylan and 'Music From Big Pink' |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date= August 24, 1968 |access-date=February 27, 2020}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Their most popular songs included \"[[The Weight]]\", \"[[The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down]]\", and \"[[Up on Cripple Creek]]\".\n\nThe Band performed their farewell concert on November 25, 1976. Footage from the event was released in 1978 as the [[concert film]] ''[[The Last Waltz]]'', directed by [[Martin Scorsese]].  It would be the last performance of the original five members.  After five years apart, Danko, Hudson, Helm, and Manuel reunited in 1983 (without Robertson) for a reunion tour. Robertson had taken up a second career as a successful producer and composer for film soundtracks. Manuel died in 1986, but the remaining three members would continue to tour and occasionally release new albums of studio material until 1999, when, upon the death of Danko, the remaining members decided to break up for good. Helm would go on to a successful solo career, winning multiple [[Grammy Awards]] in the folk and Americana categories until his 2012 death, while Hudson found a second career as a featured session musician. Robertson died in 2023, leaving Hudson as the only living member of the original lineup.\n\nMusic critic Bruce Eder described The Band as \"one of the most popular and influential rock groups in the world, their music embraced by critics ... as seriously as the music of [[the Beatles]] and [[the Rolling Stones]].\"<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Band: A Brief History |url=https://theband.hiof.no/history/band_shortstory.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030409083720/https://theband.hiof.no/history/band_shortstory.html |website=The Band |archive-date=April 9, 2003 }}{{void|Fabricakator|comment|replacing https://theartofsound.net/forum/showthread.php?51001-FONDLY-REMEMBERED-The-Band-Artist-Biography-by-Bruce-Eder&s=8b2f9e8c13afe8f24afc0b708a1b5d32}}{{cbignore}}</ref> The Band was inducted into the [[Canadian Music Hall of Fame]] in 1989 and the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1994.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://carasonline.ca/canadian-music-hall-of-fame/|title=Canadian Music Hall of Fame|website=Carasonline.ca|access-date=January 4, 2014|archive-date=August 2, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150802075451/https://carasonline.ca/canadian-music-hall-of-fame/|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/the-band/|title=The Band|website=Rockhall.com|access-date=January 4, 2014}}</ref> In 2004, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked them 50th on its [[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time|list of the 100 greatest artists of all time]],<ref>{{cite magazine| last=Williams | first=Lucinda | author-link=Lucinda Williams | title=The Immortals&nbsp;– The Greatest Artists of All Time: 50, The Band | magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|issue=946 | date=April 15, 2004 | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-artists-of-all-time-19691231/the-band-20110420 | access-date=June 20, 2017}}</ref> and ranked \"The Weight\" 41st on its list of the [[The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time|500 greatest songs of all time]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/11028260/the_rs_500_greatest_songs_of_all_time/1|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070416005906/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/11028260/the_rs_500_greatest_songs_of_all_time/1|url-status=dead|archive-date=April 16, 2007|title=The RS 500 Greatest Songs of All Time|magazine=RollingStone.com|access-date=June 2, 2007}}</ref> In 2008, the group received the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.grammy.com/Recording_Academy/Awards/Lifetime_Awards/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100826002047/http://www2.grammy.com/Recording_Academy/Awards/Lifetime_Awards/ |archive-date=2010-08-26 | title=Lifetime Achievement Award |website=Grammy.com | access-date=December 28, 2008}}{{cbignore}}</ref> In 2014, they were inducted into [[Canada's Walk of Fame]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.canadaswalkoffame.com/|title=Canada's Walk of Fame|website=Canada's Walk of Fame|language=en-CA|access-date=August 7, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===1957–1964: The Hawks===\n{{More citations needed|section|date=February 2024}}\nThe members of The Band gradually came together in the Hawks, the backing group for [[Toronto]]-based [[rockabilly]] singer [[Ronnie Hawkins]]. [[Levon Helm]] began playing with the group in 1957, then became their fulltime drummer after graduating from high school in 1958. Helm journeyed with Hawkins from [[Arkansas]] to Ontario, where they were joined by Robertson, Danko, Manuel, and finally Hudson. Latter-day Band member [[Stan Szelest]] was also in the group at that time. Hawkins's act was popular in and around Toronto and nearby Hamilton,<ref name=rock>Graham Rockingham. [http://www.thespec.com/news-story/6954409-branding-hamilton-as-a-music-city/ \"Branding Hamilton as a music city\"]. ''Hamilton Spectator'', November 9, 2016.</ref> and he had an effective way of eliminating his musical competition: when a promising band appeared, Hawkins would hire their best musicians for his own group; Robertson, Danko, and Manuel came under Hawkins's tutelage this way.\n\nWhile most of the Hawks were eager to join Hawkins's group, getting Hudson to join was a different story. He had earned a college degree, planned on a career as a music teacher, and was interested in playing rock music only as a hobby. The Hawks admired his wild, full-bore organ style and asked him repeatedly to join. Hudson finally agreed, under the condition that the Hawks each pay him $10 per week to be their instructor and purchase a new state-of-the-art Lowrey organ; all music theory questions were directed to Hudson.\n\n{{quote box|align=right|width=30%|There is a view that [[jazz]] is 'evil' because it comes from evil people, but actually the greatest priests on 52nd&nbsp;Street, and on the streets of New York City were the musicians.

And they knew how to punch through music which would cure and make people feel good.|—Garth Hudson in ''The Last Waltz''}}\n\nWith Hawkins, they recorded a few singles in this period and became well known as the best rock group in the thriving Toronto music scene. Hawkins regularly convened all-night rehearsals following long club shows, with the result that the young musicians quickly developed great technical prowess on their instruments.\n\nIn late 1963, the group split from Hawkins over personal differences. They were tired of playing the same songs so often and wanted to perform original material, and they were wary of Hawkins's heavy-handed leadership. He would fine the Hawks if they brought their girlfriends to the clubs (fearing it might reduce the numbers of \"available\" girls who came to performances) or if they smoked [[marijuana]].\n\nRobertson later said, \"Eventually, [Hawkins] built us up to the point where we outgrew his music and had to leave. He shot himself in the foot, really, by sharpening us into such a crackerjack band that we had to go on out into the world, because we knew what his vision was for himself, and we were all younger and more ambitious musically.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theband.hiof.no/articles/back_to_the_land.html |title=Andy Gill: Back to the Land |website=Theband.hiof.no |access-date=January 21, 2009}}</ref>\n\nUpon leaving Hawkins, the group was briefly known as the Levon Helm Sextet, with sixth member sax player Jerry Penfound, and then as Levon and the Hawks after Penfound's departure. In 1965, they released a single on Ware Records under the name the Canadian Squires, but they returned as Levon and the Hawks for a recording session for [[Atco Records|Atco]] later that year.<ref>Gray, 33, 37.</ref> Also in 1965, Helm and the band met blues singer and harmonica player [[Sonny Boy Williamson II|Sonny Boy Williamson]]. They wanted to record with him, offering to become his backing band, but Williamson died not long after their meeting.\n\nLater in 1965, [[Bob Dylan]] hired them for his U.S. tour in 1965 and [[Bob Dylan World Tour 1966|world tour in 1966]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Heylin | first = Clinton |author-link =Clinton Heylin| title = Behind the Shades Revisited | publisher = HarperCollins | year = 2003 | location = New York | pages = 223–260\n | isbn = 0-06-052569-X}}</ref> Following the 1966 tour, the group moved with help from Dylan and his manager, [[Albert Grossman]], to [[Saugerties (town), New York|Saugerties, New York]], where they made the informal 1967 recordings that became ''[[The Basement Tapes]]'', the basis for their 1968 debut album, ''[[Music from Big Pink]]''.

After two concerts backing Dylan, Helm and Robertson told Dylan of their loyalty to their bandmates and told him that they would continue with him only if he hired all of the Hawks. Dylan accepted and invited Levon and the Hawks to tour with him. The group was receptive to the offer, knowing it could give them the wider exposure they craved. They thought of themselves as a tightly rehearsed rock and [[rhythm and blues]] group and knew Dylan mostly from his early acoustic folk and protest music. Furthermore, they had little inkling of how internationally popular Dylan had become.<ref>Hoskyns, 94–97.</ref>\n\nWith Dylan, the Hawks played a series of concerts from September 1965 through May 1966, billed as \"Bob Dylan and the Band\".

Sessions in October and November yielded just one usable [[Single (music)|single]] (\"[[Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window?]]\"), and two days of recording in January 1966 for what was intended to be Dylan's next album, ''[[Blonde on Blonde]]'', resulted in \"[[One of Us Must Know (Sooner or Later)]]\", which was released as a single a few weeks later and was subsequently selected for the album.<ref name=\"Heylin285-286\">[[Clinton Heylin|Heylin, Clinton]].

Dylan and the Hawks played at the [[Free Trade Hall]] in [[Manchester]] on May 17, 1966. The gig became legendary when, near the end of Dylan's electric set, an audience member shouted \"[[Judas Iscariot|Judas]]!\" After a pause, Dylan replied, \"I don't believe you.

When they went into the recording studio, they still did not have a name for themselves. Stories vary as to the manner in which they ultimately adopted the name \"The Band\". In ''The Last Waltz'', Manuel claimed that they wanted to call themselves either \"the [[Honky|Honkies]]\" or \"the [[White cracker|Crackers]]\" (which they used when backing Dylan for a January 1968 concert tribute to [[Woody Guthrie]]), but these names were vetoed by their record label; Robertson suggests that during their time with Dylan everyone just referred to them as \"the band\" and the name stuck. Initially they disliked the moniker, but eventually they grew to like it, thinking it both humble and presumptuous. In 1969, ''Rolling Stone'' referred to them as \"the band from Big Pink\".<ref name=rs30>{{Cite news  | title = Big Pink Band To Tour U.S. | newspaper = [[Rolling Stone]]  | page = 9  | date = April 5, 1969 | issue = 30}}</ref>\n\nTheir debut album, ''Music from Big Pink'' (1968) was widely acclaimed. It included three songs written or co-written by Dylan (\"[[This Wheel's on Fire]]\", \"[[Tears of Rage]]\" and \"[[I Shall Be Released]]\") as well as \"[[The Weight]]\", which became one of their best-known songs after it was used in the film ''[[Easy Rider]]''. While a continuity ran through the music, the style varied from song to song.\n\n[[File:The Band -2005710053-.jpg|thumb|180px|right|alt=|Hudson in 1971]]\nIn early 1969, after the success of ''Music from Big Pink'', The Band went on tour, starting with an appearance at [[Winterland Ballroom]]. They performed at the [[Woodstock Festival]] (their performance was not included in the famed ''[[Woodstock (film)|Woodstock]]'' film because of legal complications), and later that year they performed with Dylan at the UK [[Isle of Wight Festival 1969|Isle of Wight Festival]] (several songs from which were subsequently included on Dylan's ''[[Self Portrait (Bob Dylan album)|Self Portrait]]'' album). That same year, they left for Los Angeles to record their follow-up, ''[[The Band (album)|The Band]]'' (1969). From their rustic appearance on the cover to the songs and arrangements within, the album stood in contrast to other popular music of the day. Several other artists made similar stylistic moves about the same time, notably Dylan, on ''[[John Wesley Harding]]'', which was written during the ''Basement Tapes'' sessions, and [[the Byrds]], on ''[[Sweetheart of the Rodeo]]'', which featured two ''Basement Tapes'' covers. ''The Band'' featured songs that evoked old-time rural America, from the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] in \"[[The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down]]\" to the [[labor union|unionization]] of farm workers in \"[[King Harvest (Has Surely Come)]]\".\n\nThese first two records were produced by [[John Simon (record producer)|John Simon]], who was practically a group member: he aided in [[orchestration|arrangements]] in addition to playing occasional piano and [[tuba]]. Simon reported that he was often asked about the distinctive [[horn section]]s featured so effectively on the first two albums: people wanted to know how they had achieved such memorable sounds. Simon stated that, besides Hudson (an accomplished saxophonist), the others had only rudimentary horn skills, and achieved their sound simply by creatively using their limited technique.\n\n''Rolling Stone'' lavished praise on The Band in this era, giving them more attention than perhaps any other group in the magazine's history; [[Greil Marcus]]'s articles contributed to The Band's mystique. The Band was also featured on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' (January 12, 1970), the first rock group after the Beatles, over two years earlier, to achieve this rare distinction.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Time Magazine Cover: The Band&nbsp;– Jan. 12, 1970&nbsp;– Rock&nbsp;– Singers&nbsp;– Music |url=http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19700112,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206083539/http://www.time.com/time/covers/0%2C16641%2C19700112%2C00.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 6, 2007 |magazine=Time |date=January 12, 1970 |access-date=January 21, 2009}}</ref> [[David Attie]]'s unused photographs for this cover—among the very few studio portraits taken during the Band's prime—have only recently been discovered, and were featured in Daniel Roher's [[Robbie Robertson]] documentary ''[[Once Were Brothers: Robbie Robertson and the Band]]'', as well as having their own four-page spread in [[Harvey Kubernik]] and Ken Kubernik's “The Story of the Band: From ''Big Pink'' to ''The Last Waltz''” (Sterling Publishing, 2018).<ref>[[Harvey Kubernik|Kubernik, Harvey]] & Kenneth, The Story of The Band, 2018, Sterling: p122-125.</ref>\n\nA critical and commercial triumph, ''The Band'', along with works by the Byrds and [[the Flying Burrito Brothers]], established a musical template (dubbed [[country rock]]) that paved the way to the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]]. Both ''Big Pink'' and ''The Band'' also influenced their musical contemporaries. [[Eric Clapton]] and [[George Harrison]] cited The Band as a major influence on their musical direction in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Clapton later revealed that he wanted to join the group.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uncut.co.uk/music/eric_clapton/reviews/8542|title=Eric Clapton&nbsp;– Derek and The Dominos&nbsp;– ''Layla & Other Assorted...''|website=Uncut.co.uk|access-date=January 21, 2009|archive-date=November 26, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111126022720/http://www.uncut.co.uk/music/eric_clapton/reviews/8542|url-status=dead}}</ref> While he never did join, he recruited all of the members of The Band as well as other roots rock performers for his 1976 album ''[[No Reason to Cry]]''.\n\nFollowing their second album, The Band embarked on their first tour as a lead act. The anxiety of fame was clear, as the group's songs turned to darker themes of fear and alienation: the influence on their next work is self-explanatory. ''[[Stage Fright (album)|Stage Fright]]'' (1970) was engineered by musician-engineer-producer [[Todd Rundgren]] and recorded on a theatre stage in Woodstock. As with their previous, self-titled record, Robertson was credited with most of the songwriting. Initial critical reaction was positive, but it was seen as a letdown from the previous two albums for various reasons. After recording ''Stage Fright'', The Band was among the acts participating in the [[Festival Express]], an all-star rock concert tour of Canada by train that also included [[Janis Joplin]], the [[Grateful Dead]] and future Band member [[Richard Bell (Canadian musician)|Richard Bell]] (at the time he was a member of Joplin's band). In the concert documentary film, released in 2003, Danko can be seen participating in a drunken jam session with [[Jerry Garcia]], [[Bob Weir]], [[John Dawson (musician)|John Dawson]], and Joplin while singing \"Ain't No More Cane\".\n\nAt about this time, Robertson began exerting greater control over The Band, a point of contention between him and Helm. Helm charges Robertson with [[authoritarianism]] and greed, while Robertson suggests his increased efforts in guiding the group were largely because Danko, Helm, and Manuel were becoming more unreliable due to their heroin usage.<ref>{{cite magazine | last=Crouch | first=Ian | date=December 8, 2016 | title=Robbie Robertson Offers His Story of The Band | magazine=[[The New Yorker]] | url=https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/robbie-robertson-offers-his-story-of-the-band | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170810032117/https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/robbie-robertson-offers-his-story-of-the-band | archive-date=2017-08-10 | url-access=subscription | access-date=February 17, 2023}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Robertson insists he did his best to coax Manuel into writing more songs, only to see him descend into addiction.\n\nDespite mounting problems among the group members, The Band forged ahead with their next album, ''[[Cahoots (album)|Cahoots]]'' (1971). ''Cahoots'' featured Dylan's \"[[When I Paint My Masterpiece]]\", \"4% Pantomime\" (with [[Van Morrison]]), and \"[[Life Is a Carnival]]\", the last featuring a horn arrangement by [[Allen Toussaint]]. Toussaint's contribution was a critical addition to The Band's next project, and the group would later record two songs written by Toussaint: \"[[Holy Cow (Lee Dorsey song)|Holy Cow]]\" on ''[[Moondog Matinee]]'' and \"You See Me\" on ''[[Jubilation (The Band album)|Jubilation]]''. In late December 1971, The Band recorded the live album ''[[Rock of Ages (The Band album)|Rock of Ages]]'', which was released in the summer of 1972. On ''Rock of Ages'', they were bolstered by the addition of a horn section, with arrangements written by Toussaint. Dylan appeared on stage on [[New Year's Eve]] and performed four songs with the group, including a version of \"When I Paint My Masterpiece\".\n\n===1973–1975: Move to Shangri-La===\n[[File:Bob Dylan and The Band - 1974.jpg|thumb|right|alt=|Bob Dylan and the Band in Chicago, 1974: (left to right) Danko, Robertson, Dylan and Helm]]\n\nIn 1973, The Band released the [[covers album]] ''[[Moondog Matinee]]''. There was no tour in support of the album, which garnered mixed reviews. However, on July 28, 1973, they played at the legendary [[Summer Jam at Watkins Glen]], a massive concert that took place at the Grand Prix Raceway outside [[Watkins Glen, New York]]. The event, which was attended by over 600,000 fans, also featured the Grateful Dead and [[the Allman Brothers Band]]. It was during this event that discussions began about a possible tour with Bob Dylan, who had moved to [[Malibu, California]],<ref name=Marty>{{cite book| last =Newman| first =Martin Alan| title =Bob Dylan's Malibu| publisher =EDLIS Café Press| year =2021| location =Hibbing, Minnesota| isbn =9781736972304}}</ref> along with Robertson. By late 1973, Danko, Helm, Hudson and Manuel had joined them, and the first order of business was backing Dylan on his album ''[[Planet Waves]]''. The album was released concurrently with their joint 1974 tour, in which they played 40 shows in North America during January and February 1974. Later that year, the tour was documented on the live album ''[[Before the Flood (album)|Before the Flood]]'',.\n\nDuring this time, The Band brought in ''Planet Waves'' producer [[Rob Fraboni]] to help design a music studio for the group. By 1975, the studio, [[Shangri-La (recording studio)|Shangri-La]], was completed. That year, The Band recorded and released ''[[Northern Lights – Southern Cross]]'', their first album of all-new material since 1971. All eight songs were written exclusively by Robertson. Despite comparatively poor record sales, the album is favored by critics and fans. Levon Helm regards this album highly in his book, ''[[This Wheel's on Fire: Levon Helm and the Story of The Band|This Wheel's on Fire]]'': \"It was the best album we had done since ''The Band''.\" The album also produced more experimentation from Hudson, switching to synthesizers, showcased on \"Jupiter Hollow\".\n\n===1976–1978: ''The Last Waltz''===\n{{main article|The Last Waltz}}\n[[File:The Last Waltz.jpg|thumb|alt=|right|The Band with guests at the Last Waltz concert.

After ''Northern Lights&nbsp;– Southern Cross'' failed to meet commercial expectations, much of the group's 1976 tour was confined to theaters and smaller arenas in secondary markets (including the [[Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium]], the [[Long Island Arena]] and the Champlain Valley Expo in [[Essex Junction, Vermont]]), culminating in an opening slot for the ascendant [[ZZ Top]] at the [[Nashville Fairgrounds]] in September.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://theband.hiof.no/history/The_Band_in_Concert_1976.pdf |title=The Band In Concert, 1976 |date=November 2018 |website=theband.hiof.no}}</ref> In early September, Richard Manuel suffered a severe neck injury in a boating accident in Texas,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-band-drifting-toward-the-last-waltz-19761216?page=2 |url-access=subscription |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180728071138/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/the-band-drifting-toward-the-last-waltz-242332/ |archive-date=July 28, 2018 |title=The Band: Drifting Toward the Last Waltz |author=Patrick Snyder |website=Rollingstone.com |date=December 16, 1976 |access-date=October 29, 2015 }}{{cbignore}}</ref> prompting Robertson to urge The Band to retire from live performances after staging a massive \"farewell concert\" known as ''[[The Last Waltz]]''.

Other guests they admired (and in most cases had worked with before) included [[Muddy Waters]], [[Dr. John]], Van Morrison, [[Ringo Starr]], Eric Clapton, [[Ron Wood]], [[Bobby Charles]], [[Neil Diamond]], and [[Paul Butterfield]]. The concert was filmed by Robertson's friend, filmmaker [[Martin Scorsese]].<ref>{{Cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-news/why-the-bands-the-last-waltz-is-the-greatest-concert-movie-of-all-time-104637/ |url-access=subscription |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181129130745/https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-news/why-the-bands-the-last-waltz-is-the-greatest-concert-movie-of-all-time-104637/ |archive-date=November 29, 2018 |title=Why The Band's 'The Last Waltz' Is the Best Concert Movie of All Time |last1=Fear |first1=David |date=November 25, 2016 |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |language=en-US |access-date=August 7, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 1977, The Band released their seventh studio album ''[[Islands (The Band album)|Islands]]'', which fulfilled their record contract with Capitol so that a planned ''Last Waltz'' film and album could be released on the [[Warner Bros. Records|Warner Bros.]] label. ''Islands'' contained a mix of originals and covers, and was the last with The Band's original lineup. That same year, the group recorded soundstage performances with country singer [[Emmylou Harris]] (\"Evangeline\") and gospel-soul group [[the Staple Singers]] (\"The Weight\"); Scorsese combined these new performances—as well as interviews he had conducted with the group—with the 1976 concert footage. The resulting [[concert film]]–[[documentary film|documentary]] was released in 1978, along with a [[The Last Waltz (1978 album)|three-LP soundtrack]].\n\nHelm later wrote about ''The Last Waltz'' in his autobiography, ''This Wheel's on Fire'', in which he made the case that it had been primarily Robbie Robertson's project and that Robertson had forced The Band's breakup on the rest of the group.<ref>Levon Helm and Stephen Davis. ''This Wheel's on Fire: Levon Helm and the Story of the Band'', Chapter Nine: ''The Last Waltz''</ref> Robertson offered a different take in a 1986 interview: \"I made my big statement. I did the movie, I made a three-record album about it—and if this is only my statement, not theirs, I'll accept that. They're saying, 'Well, that was really his trip, not our trip.' Well, fine.

In 1993, the group released their eighth studio album, ''[[Jericho (The Band album)|Jericho]]''. Without Robbie Robertson as primary lyricist, much of the [[songwriting]] for the album came from outside of the group.

Later that year Robertson appeared with Danko and Hudson as the Band for the second time since the original group broke up. The occasion was the induction of The Band into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].

Past guests have included [[Jackie Greene]], ''Music from Big Pink'' producer John Simon and [[John Sebastian]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jambands.com/news/2016/01/26/the-weight-to-host-camp-cripple-creek|title=The Weight to Host Camp Cripple Creek|website=Jambands.com|date=January 26, 2016}}</ref>\n\nManuel had few projects outside The Band; he and the rest of The Band contributed to Eric Clapton's 1976 album ''No Reason to Cry''. It included an original composition by Manuel and featured his vocals and drumming on several tracks. Manuel later worked on several film scores with Hudson and Robertson, including ''[[Raging Bull]]'' and ''[[The Color of Money]]''. ''[[Whispering Pines: Live at the Getaway]]'' was released in 2002.\n\n==Musical style==\n[[File:The Band - 2005710051.jpg|thumb|right|The Band in Hamburg, 1971: (left to right) Manuel, Danko, Robertson, and Helm]]\nThe Band's music fused many elements: primarily old [[country music]] and early [[rock and roll]], though the [[rhythm section]] often was reminiscent of [[Stax Records|Stax]]- or [[Motown]]-style rhythm and blues, and Robertson cites [[Curtis Mayfield]] and the [[Staple Singers]] as major influences, resulting in a [[wikt:synthesis|synthesis]] of many [[musical genre]]s. Singers Manuel, Danko, and Helm each brought a distinctive voice to The Band: Helm's [[Southern American English|Southern]] accent was prevalent in his raw and powerful vocals, Danko sang tenor with a distinctively choppy enunciation, and Manuel alternated between falsetto and a soulful baritone. The singers regularly blended in [[Vocal harmony|harmonies]]. Though the singing was more or less evenly shared among the three, both Danko and Helm have stated that they saw Manuel as The Band's \"lead\" singer.<ref>''Classic albums: The Band'' documentary, 1997.</ref>\n\nEvery member was a multi-instrumentalist. There was little instrument-switching when they played live, but when recording, the musicians could make up different configurations in service of the songs. Hudson in particular was able to coax a wide range of [[timbre]]s from his [[Lowrey organ]]. Helm's drumming was often praised: critic Jon Carroll declared that Helm was \"the only drummer who can make you cry,\" while prolific session drummer [[Jim Keltner]] admits to appropriating several of Helm's techniques.<ref>Hoskyns, 189.</ref> Producer John Simon is often cited as a \"sixth member\" of The Band for producing and playing on ''Music from Big Pink'', co-producing and playing on ''The Band'', and playing on other songs up through The Band's 1993 reunion album ''Jericho''.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fEA7MuMoLqcC&q=john+simon+sixth+member+of+the+band&pg=PA239 |title=Barney Hoskyns&nbsp;– ''Across the Great Divide: The Band and America'' |isbn=9781423414421 |access-date=October 18, 2011|last=Hoskyns |first=Barney |author-link=Barney Hoskyns |year=2006 |publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation }}</ref>\n\n==Copyright controversy==\nRobertson is credited as writer or co-writer of the majority of The Band's songs and, as a result, has received most of the songwriting royalties generated from the music. This would become a point of contention, especially for Helm. In his 1993 autobiography, ''This Wheel's on Fire: Levon Helm and the Story of the Band'', Helm disputed the validity of the songwriting credits as listed on the albums and explained that the Band's songs were developed in collaboration with all members. Danko concurred with Helm: \"I think Levon's book hits the nail on the head about where Robbie and Albert Grossman and some of those people went wrong and when The Band stopped being The Band&nbsp;... I'm truly friends with everybody but, hey—it could happen to Levon, too. When people take themselves too seriously and believe too much in their own bullshit, they usually get in trouble.\"<ref>[[Bill Flanagan|Flanagan, Bill]]. \"[http://theband.hiof.no/articles/musician_rd_dec_1993.html Rick Danko on The Band&nbsp;– New Albums, Old Wounds]\" ''Musician'' magazine #182, December 1993.</ref> Robertson denied that Helm had written any of the songs attributed to Robertson.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theband.hiof.no/articles/bs_lw_ct_040702.html |title=Greg Kot: 'Waltz' bittersweet for many, but not Robbie Robertson |website=Theband.hiof.no |date=April 7, 2002 |access-date=April 24, 2014}}</ref> The studio albums recorded by Levon Helm as a solo artist—''[[Levon Helm (1978 album)|Levon Helm]]'' (1978), ''[[American Son (album)|American Son]]'', ''[[Levon Helm (1982 album)|Levon Helm]]'' (1982), ''Dirt Farmer'', and ''Electric Dirt''—contain only one song crediting him as songwriter (\"Growin' Trade\", co-written with [[Larry Campbell (musician)|Larry Campbell]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://americansongwriter.com/levon-helm-and-songwriting-larry-campbell-and-robbie-robertson-weigh-in/ |title=Levon Helm and Songwriting: Larry Campbell and Robbie Robertson Weigh In|magazine=[[American Songwriter]]|date=September 11, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/robbie-robertson-offers-his-story-of-the-band|title=Robbie Robertson Offers His Story of The Band|first=Ian|last=Crouch|date=December 9, 2016|website=Newyorker.com|access-date=January 2, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nThe Band has influenced numerous bands, songwriters and performers, including the Grateful Dead; Eric Clapton; George Harrison; Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young;<ref>Gray, 36–37.</ref> [[Led Zeppelin]];<ref>[[Mick Wall]] (2008), ''When Giants Walked the Earth: A Biography of Led Zeppelin'', London: Orion, p. 181.</ref><!--This is sourced and relevant, do not remove--> [[Elvis Costello]];<ref>Hoskyns, 169.</ref> [[Elton John]];<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Seaggs |first1=Austin |title=The Rolling Stone Interview: Elton John |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |issue=1124 |pages=36–68 |date=February 17, 2011}}</ref> [[Phish]];<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.americansongwriter.com/2012/04/10-goodbyes-to-levon-helm/ |title=10 Goodbyes to Levon Helm |magazine=[[American Songwriter]]|access-date=February 19, 2013}}</ref> and [[Pink Floyd]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2013/06/26/today-in-music-history-the-band-release-music-from-big-pink|title=Today in Music History: The Band Release \"Music From Big Pink\"|website=Thecurrent.org}}</ref>\n\nThe album ''Music from Big Pink'', in particular, is credited with contributing to Clapton's decision to leave the [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[Cream (band)|Cream]].

In a 1969 interview, Robbie Robertson remarked on the group's influence, \"We certainly didn't want everybody to go out and get a banjo and a fiddle player. We were trying to calm things down a bit though. What we're going to do now is go to [[Muscle Shoals, Alabama]], and record four sides, four [[psychedelic music|psychedelic]] songs.

Counting Crows indicated this influence with their tribute to the late [[Richard Manuel]], \"[[If I Could Give All My Love (Richard Manuel Is Dead)]]\", from their album ''[[Hard Candy (Counting Crows album)|Hard Candy]]''.
