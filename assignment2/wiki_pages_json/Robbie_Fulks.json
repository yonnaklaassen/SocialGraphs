One disc, labeled ''Standing'', featured a full-band sound, while the second disc, ''Sitting,'' consisted of Fulks solo with little or no musical accompaniment. ''Standing'' opens with the tongue-in-cheek studio track \"We're on the Road\", which describes life on tour and simulates a telephone call to Fulks from Yep Roc Records President Glenn Dicker, demanding a new record and denigrating the sales performance of the \"path-breaking, not chart-breaking\" album ''Georgia Hard.''\n\nIn 2009, Fulks released an alphabetically organized collection of 50 songs via his website, a compilation called ''50-Vc.
