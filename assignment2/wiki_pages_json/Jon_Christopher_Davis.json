His songs have been covered by [[Dolly Parton]], [[Hal Ketchum]], [[Timothy B. Schmit]] of [[the Eagles]], [[Billy Ray Cyrus]], [[Sherrie Austin]], [[Tammy Cochran]] and various [[Independent artist|indie artists]]. His music has been featured on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[CBS]], [[FOX]], [[CMT (American TV channel)|CMT]] and in [[USA Today]], ''[[Billboard]]'', ''[[Texas Highways]]'' and the ''[[Washington Post]]''. His discography includes work with [[Vince Gill]], [[Radney Foster]], [[Rodney Crowell]], [[Steve Lukather]] ([[Toto (band)|Toto]]), [[Stan Lynch]] ([[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]]), [[Dann Huff]] ([[Carrie Underwood]], [[Keith Urban]]) and [[David Z (producer)|David Z]] ([[Prince]], [[Jonny Lang]]).\n\n==Early career==\nDavis began his career in 1990 by playing the [[Dallas]] bar scene. In 1996, he was encouraged to move to [[Nashville]] by Grammy Award-winner, [[Rodney Crowell]]. In 1998, Davis signed with [[Warner/Chappell Music]] where he wrote songs for major-label artists. The following year, he signed an artist development deal with [[Warner Bros. Records]]. After six months, the label considered the recordings to be too left of center and eventually shelved the project. Those self-produced recordings caught the ear of hit producer, Dann Huff, who later signed Davis to his new subsidiary label under [[Sony Records]].\n\n==2002–2007==\nIn 2002, Davis signed with [[MCA Records]] where fellow Texas singer-songwriter, [[Radney Foster]], came on board as producer. Davis also signed a new publishing deal with [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]] Publishing. When MCA decided to not release the record, Davis returned to his Texas roots and signed with the indie label, [[Palo Duro Records]]. After his debut album received a national release in 2006, ''[[USA Today]]'' called his song, The Bottom Line, \"One of the most intriguing tracks from the present, past and near future.\" The album also caught the attention of renowned music critic, [[Robert K. Oermann]] – \"I’m a huge fan of this man’s album. Its second single sizzles with zesty rhythm, yelping vocals, sidewinder guitar and a ridiculously catchy melody. The major-label 'stars' on [[Music Row]] have nothing on this guy.\"\n\n==2008–2013==\nIn 2008, Davis released the patriotic single, The Boy I Left Behind, with fellow Texas singer-songwriter, [[Deryl Dodd]]. It became the official theme song for The American Fallen Soldiers Project.\n\nIn 2009, Davis was the Texas statewide voice for [[Energy Future Holdings|TXU]] Energy. That same year, he released \"Demos From the Vault (1999–2009).\" The double album features guest appearances by [[Vince Gill]], Radney Foster, [[Jon Randall]], [[Steve Lukather]] (Toto) and Stan Lynch (The Heartbreakers).\n\nIn 2010, Davis was awarded Song of the Year by the [[American Cancer Society]].\n\nIn 2012, Davis was a featured artist on Troubadour TX, a national TV show following the careers of Texas singer-songwriters.\n\nIn 2013, LSA Burger Co. (named after his top 40 dance hall track, Lone Star Attitude) opened in Denton, TX. A second location is in The Colony, TX.\nThere are also two airport stores named after Lone Star Attitude located at [[DFW International Airport]].\n\n==2014–present==\nIn 2014, Davis released the album, \"Last Night's Dinner Party.\" \n\nIn 2016, Davis collaborated with CMA Song of the Year nominee, [[Max T. Barnes]], on several singles and produced eight music videos.\n\nIn 2018, Davis released the album, \"New Wind Blowing.\" \n\nIn 2020, Davis released the EP, \"The Ride.\" \n\nDavis is currently working on a new band project with Stan Lynch (Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Don Henley) called The Speaker Wars.\n\n==Discography==\n;Albums\n* ''Jon Christopher Davis Live'' (2005)\n* ''Jon Christopher Davis'' (2006)\n* ''Demos from the Vault (1999–2009)'' \n* ''Last Night's Dinner Party'' (2014)\n* ''New Wind Blowing'' (2018)\n* ''The Ride'' (2020)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* https://www.jonchristopherdavis.com/\n*[http://www.facebook.com/jonchristopherdavismusic Facebook page]\n* https://www.instagram.com/jonchristopherdavis/\n*http://countrymusic.about.com/od/cdreviewsmz/fr/jcdavis.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130415180145/http://countrymusic.about.com/od/cdreviewsmz/fr/jcdavis.htm |date=April 15, 2013 }}\n*http://www.allmusic.com/album/jon-christopher-davis-r849749/review\n*http://artreach.smugmug.com/Community-Programs/Sept-2010-Texas-Music-Project/13601132_PKsRW#992217115_rSehu\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Davis, Jon Christopher}}\n[[Category:American country singer-songwriters]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:1968 births]]"
