He learned to play the fiddle at an early age, his first influence being the fiddlers Grady Stringer and Walter Warden.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> He married in 1914 at the age of sixteen.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> Initially he began performing at local dances and fiddlers' conventions. He teamed up with his wife Nettie, his cousin Homer Smith and fiddler Floyd Ethredge.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> In 1921, Smith began working as a logger and a linesman for a railroad company in [[Dickson, Tennessee]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/> In his work he had to make extensive travels and that enabled him to meet other musicians along the way. He attended several fiddle contests across Tennessee winning the bulk of them.\n\nSmith made his solo debut as a fiddler on the [[Grand Ole Opry]] on December 23, 1927.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> He was made a member of The Opry in the 1920s.<ref>{{cite web\n| title = Opry Timeline - 1920s\n| url = http://www.opry.com/about/Timeline.html\n| website= Opry.com\n| access-date = July 5, 2012}}</ref>  Within weeks he was accompanied by his cousin Homer Smith.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> In the meantime, Fiddlin' Arthur Smith continued to work on the railroad.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> In the 1930s, Smith formed The Dixieliners together with the [[McGee Brothers]], and his daughter Lavonne who played the piano.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> They became a regular act on the Opry in May 1932 performing popular songs such as \"Walking in My Sleep\", \"Pig in the Pen\" and \"Blackberry Blossom\". The Dixieliners toured the countryside featuring [[Uncle Dave Macon]] and the [[Delmore Brothers]] on some of these tours.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> In January 1935, Smith made his first recordings with the Delmore Brothers on the [[Bluebird Records|Bluebird]] label.<ref name=\"russell\">Russell, Tony. ''Country Music Records: A Discography, 1921-1942''. [[Oxford University Press]], US, 2004. pp. 840-842, {{ISBN|978-0195139891}}</ref> In 1936, Smith began to sing on his recordings on songs such as, \"Chittlin' Cookin' Time in Cheatham County\", \"There's More Pretty Girls Than One\", and his signature song, \"Beautiful Brown Eyes\". That particular song, recorded in August 1937, led Smith to take action in court against some musicians, who had recorded the song as if it was in the public domain.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> He ended up winning the suit.\n\nBecause of the hard work it took to maintain two full-time jobs, on the railroad and as a professional musician, Smith fell into hard drinking.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> In February 1938, it led to a temporary three-month suspension from the Opry.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> With assistance from [[Roy Acuff]], Smith returned to the music circuit.\n\nIn 1938, Smith's first recordings as Arthur Smith & His Dixieliners appeared on [[Bluebird Records|Bluebird]],<ref name=\"russell\" /> a band name he would again and again revisit, into the 1960s.  In 1939, Smith joined the Tennessee Valley Boys, consisting of [[Howdy Forrester]] and Georgia Slim Rutland.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> The following year, he left to join the Shelton Brothers in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/> Once again, he left and instead formed a new group, The Band of Arthurs, in [[Decatur, Alabama]] with his daughter Lavonne and some other musicians all named Arthur.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nIn the early 1940s, Smith joined the Bailes Brothers, and published two songbooks, ''Songs From the Hills of Tennessee'' and ''Arthur Smith's Original Song Folio no. 1''.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> In the following years, he performed with artists such as [[Rex Griffin]] and [[Jimmy Wakely]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/> This led to an invitation from Hollywood in 1944 to appear in some low budget westerns.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> His film career ended in 1948. Smith signed with [[Capitol Records]], but to avoid confusion with the newcomer [[Arthur \"Guitar Boogie\" Smith]], Fiddlin' Arthur Smith's recordings were released under the name of The Original Arthur Smith and His Dixieliners.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> After a brief stint with [[Billy Walker (musician)|Billy Walker]], Smith retired, and briefly worked as a carpenter in [[Nashville, Tennessee]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nRoy Acuff performed and recorded Smith's song, \"Beautiful, Brown Eyes\". This led to several artists recording the song, believing it was in the public domain, and Smith had to sue them in court. He eventually won the suit and received a lump sum.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nSmith made a comeback and joined up with [[Merle Travis]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/> In 1957, [[Mike Seeger]] arranged a recording session with Smith and the McGee Brothers, held in Kirk McGee's living room.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> Eight years later, the recordings were released on an album.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> In 1965, Smith and the McGee Brothers appeared at the [[Newport Folk Festival]]. He made his last appearance in 1969, with Sleepy Marlin and Tommy Riggs.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> Smith died in 1971 in [[Louisville, Kentucky]], and was buried near [[McEwen, Tennessee]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\n==Discography==\n78s: \nIn various prewar line-ups, Smith recorded singles on [[Bluebird Records|Bluebird]], [[Victor Talking Machine Company|Victor]], [[Regal Zonophone Records|Regal Zonophone]] (Australia), The Twin (India), and Montgomery Ward labels, and in the post-war years on [[Black & White Records|Black & White]], [[Capitol Records|Capitol]], and Urban.\n\nLPs: \n* Fiddlin’ Arthur Smith & The Dixieliners : ''Rare Old Time Fiddle Tunes'' - [[Starday Records|Starday]] SLP-202 (1962); reissued Pine Mountain PMR-202.\n* Arthur Smith & the McGee Brothers : ''Mountain Songs and Instrumentals'' - [[Folkways Records|Folkways]] FA-2379 (1964)\n* Arthur Smith & the McGee Brothers : ''Milk 'Em in the Evening Blues'' - [[Folkways Records|Folkways]] FTS-31007 (1968)\n\nReissued material also appears on:\n* Fiddlin’ Arthur Smith & His Dixieliners : ''Vol. 1 - County 546'' (1978)\n* Fiddlin’ Arthur Smith & His Dixieliners : ''Vol. 2 - County 547'' (1978)\n* Fiddlin’ Arthur Smith & His Dixieliners : eponymous - County CO-CD-3526 (2002)\n* Fiddlin’ Arthur Smith & His Dixieliners : ''Appalachian Stomp Down, Disc D'' - [[JSP Records|JSP]] JSP-7761D (2006)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Ryan J.
