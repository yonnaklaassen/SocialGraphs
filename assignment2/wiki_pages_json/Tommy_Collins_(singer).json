He enjoyed a string of hits during the mid-1950s including \"It Tickles\" and \"Watcha Gonna Do Now\".<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/>\n\nMany of the songs he wrote were recorded by other artists. His song \"[[If You Ain't Lovin' (You Ain't Livin')]]\" was a top 10 hit for [[Faron Young]] in 1954 and, decades later, hit No. 1 on the chart for [[George Strait]] in 1988. In late 1963, [[Buck Owens]] released an LP consisting entirely of songs written or co-written by Collins, [[Buck Owens Sings Tommy Collins]], which reached No. 1 on the Billboard [[Top Country Albums]] chart in January 1964, holding the top spot for two weeks.<ref name=\"Billboard\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/buck-owens/chart-history/clp/|title=Chart History: Buck Owens|author=<!--Not stated-->|website=www.billboard.com|access-date=January 24, 2024}}</ref>\n\nAfter several years in the ministry, Collins returned to recording.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> In 1965, he had a comeback hit with \"If You Can't Bite, Don't Growl\".<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> In the 1970s, he wrote several hits for [[Merle Haggard]] and [[The Strangers (American band)|The Strangers]], including the No. 1 hits \"[[Carolyn (song)|Carolyn]]\" and \"[[The Roots of My Raising (song)|The Roots of My Raising]]\". In June 1980, Haggard recorded a biographical tribute to Collins called \"[[Leonard (song)|Leonard]]\".\n\nCollins was the inspiration and character talked about in [[Craig Morgan]]'s song, \"I Wish I Could See Bakersfield\".\n\nCollins remained active in the songwriting business. In 1999, he was inducted into the [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]], in a class of inductees that also included [[Wayne Kemp]], [[A.L. \"Doodle\" Owens]], and [[Glenn Sutton]].<ref name=\"NSHoF\">{{Cite web|url=https://nashvillesongwritersfoundation.com/Site/inductee?entry_id=1914|title=Tommy Collins|author=<!--Not stated-->|website=nashvillesongwritersfoundation.com|access-date=January 23, 2024}}</ref> He died March 14, 2000, at his home in [[Ashland City, Tennessee]].<ref name=\"Ok\">{{Cite web|url=https://oklahoman.com/article/2690091/country-music-writer-tommy-collins-dies-at-69/|title=Country music writer Tommy Collins dies at 69|date=March 16, 2000|website=Oklahoman.com|access-date=August 5, 2021}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n===Albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
