The band is composed of [[Michael Kang (musician)|Michael Kang]] (acoustic/electric [[mandolin]], electric guitar, and [[violin]]), Michael Travis ([[Drum kit|drums]] and [[percussion instrument|percussion]]), [[Bill Nershi]] ([[Steel-string guitar|acoustic guitar]], [[lap steel guitar]], and electric [[slide guitar]]), [[Kyle Hollingsworth]] ([[piano]], [[organ (music)|organ]], [[Rhodes piano|Rhodes]], and [[accordion]]), and [[Keith Moseley]] ([[bass guitar]]), and, since 2004, [[Jason Hann]] (auxiliary percussion).<ref>{{Cite web |date=May 16, 2024 |title=The String Cheese Incident |url=https://www.tingpavilion.com/events/detail/the-string-cheese-incident-1 |url-status=live |access-date=September 23, 2023 |website=Ting Pavilion}}</ref>\n\nTheir music has elements of [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] sounds, as well as [[rock and roll|rock]], [[electronica]], [[calypso music|calypso]], [[country music|country]], [[funk]], [[jazz]], [[Latin American music|Latin]], [[progressive rock]], [[reggae]], and [[psychedelic rock|psychedelia]]. All members write original compositions and sing.<ref>{{Cite web |date=September 23, 2024 |title=The String Cheese Incident |url=https://www.redlightmanagement.com/artists/the-string-cheese-incident/ |url-status=live |access-date=September 23, 2024 |website=Red Light Management}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===1996–2001===\nAfter a few years of playing local ski resorts and private functions, the band formed the [[independent record label]] [[SCI Fidelity]], on which they released their first album, ''[[Born on the Wrong Planet]]'', an album split between originals and covers. The album featured melody-driven music with room for improvisation. Instrumentals and covers constituted half of the album. Many songs from the first album are still frequently played by the band, including \"Black Clouds\", \"Land's End\", \"Texas\", and \"Jellyfish.\"\n\nLess than a year later, SCI released a compilation of ten songs, including \"Land's End\", on their self-titled live album ''[[A String Cheese Incident]]'', which chronicles a single concert from the [[Fox Theatre (Boulder)|Fox Theatre]] in [[Boulder, Colorado]] and adds [[pianist]] Hollingsworth to the ensemble (he was not in the band during the recording of ''Born on the Wrong Planet''). Despite spanning only one disc and containing only ten tracks, the album clocks in at 72 minutes even (thus, with an average track length of 7:12, displaying their propensity for extended jams).\n\n''[['Round the Wheel]]'', released in 1998, refined the band's sound and displayed a marked increase in both musical and lyrical maturity, and added [[Paul McCandless]] as a guest player on [[soprano saxophone|soprano]] and [[tenor saxophone]] and [[Tony Furtado]] on banjo, but did not earn them quite the level of fame that they would achieve in the next [[millennium]]. From 1998 through 2001 SCI toured the country extensively and steadily, playing over 500 \"Incidents\" in hundreds of cities, including an appearance at [[Woodstock '99]].\n\nIn 2001, with the help of guest producer and [[Los Lobos]] member [[Steve Berlin]], they released their third studio effort, ''[[Outside Inside (SCI)|Outside Inside]]''. This album marked a shift from the band's traditional [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] leanings to a more standard [[rock and roll|rock]] sound, thus making it the most accessible album to a mainstream audience to that point. The band did not completely abandon its bluegrass roots, however, sneaking in the short three-minute track \"Up the Canyon\" at the end of the disc, which has become one of many live favorites along with \"Rollover\", \"Close Your Eyes\", and others.\n\n===2002–2004===\nIn August 2003, SCI's in-house ticket selling service, SCI Ticketing (now Baseline Ticketing<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jambase.com/Articles/5483/SCI-TICKETING-MORPHS-INTO-BASELINE-TICKETS|title=Sci Ticketing Morphs Into Baseline Tickets On Jambase|publisher=Jambase.com|date=2011-07-08|access-date=2011-07-18}}</ref>), sued [[Ticketmaster]], which controlled nearly all of the larger venues the band was playing. SCI alleged that by restricting bands from selling directly to fans more than 8% of a venue's tickets violated the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]].  The suit followed an unsuccessful petitioning by SCI, [[R.E.M.]], [[Pearl Jam]] and other bands calling for the U.S. Department of Justice to investigate Ticketmaster's high service fees and anti-competitive practices.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.madisonhousepublicity.com/midpages/copypages/sci.copypages/sci.clips.forbes.html|title=String Cheese Incident takes Ticketmaster to court|author=Forbes|author-link=Forbes|access-date=2003-08-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031208041511/http://www.madisonhousepublicity.com/midpages/copypages/sci.copypages/sci.clips.forbes.html|archive-date=2003-12-08|url-status=dead}}</ref>  The parties settled in 2008, and the band gained a larger allotment of tickets to sell and agreed  to not publicize the settlement.<ref>{{cite web|author=Benjy Eisen |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/string-cheese-incident-eliminate-service-charges-for-summer-tour-20120302 |title=String Cheese Incident Eliminate Service Charges for Summer Tour &#124; Music News |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=2012-03-02 |access-date=2013-07-01}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2003, SCI released their fourth studio album, ''[[Untying the Not]]'', produced by [[Martin Glover|Martin \"Youth\" Glover]], formerly of the band the [[Killing Joke]]. The release continued SCI's use of [[electronic music]] and [[trance music|trance]] elements. Both Travis and Kang got into electronic music around the same time and started pushing the group in that direction.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://relix.com/articles/detail/the-core-michael-travis-relix-revisited/|title=The Core: Michael Travis (Relix Revisited)|date=19 October 2011|website=Relix Media|access-date=27 February 2023}}</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 2004, SCI booked to play the touring festival [[Lollapalooza]]; thereby becoming the caravan's first [[jam band]]. But poor ticket sales led to the festival's cancellation and the band re-routed its summer tour.\n\n===2005–2006===\nIn June 2005, the band released their fifth studio album, titled ''[[One Step Closer (The String Cheese Incident album)|One Step Closer]]'', containing thirteen original tracks with guest songwriting collaborations, including Jim Lauderdale.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jambands.com/Features/content_2005_07_07.06.phtml|title=Jambands.com &#124; Features &#124; Bill Nershi's \"Big Compromise\"  |date=11 November 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051111043533/http://www.jambands.com/Features/content_2005_07_07.06.phtml |access-date=27 February 2023|archive-date=2005-11-11 }}</ref> In 2005, the band also welcomed percussionist [[Jason Hann]]. The album was produced by [[Malcolm Burn]] at a studio in [[Boulder, Colorado]], where the band is based. ''One Step Closer'' was a return to the more roots-based music of earlier String Cheese Incident fare, while still retaining some of the pop sensibility of previous studio albums.{{citation needed|date=February 2023}}\n\nThrough Madison House Inc., the company that manages and books SCI, the band organized 'Big Summer Classic', a 2005 traveling festival tour across the United States. Seven-person ensemble [[New Monsoon]] opened the festival's shows, which included acts such as [[Umphrey's McGee]], [[Yonder Mountain String Band]], [[Michael Franti]] & [[Spearhead (band)|Spearhead]], and [[Keller Williams]]. The band played in medium-size outdoor venues, such as minor-league baseball parks.\n\nIn 2005, the band returned to their roots: playing shows at the base of ski resorts, summer festivals, smaller venues, and touring throughout the U.S. Band members announced to their fans that the band would take a break from touring in early 2006. They recommenced in the summer of the same year to play several co-headlining shows with [[Bob Weir]]'s [[RatDog]] including a sold-out two-night run at [[Red Rocks]] in [[Morrison, Colorado]] and a set at the [[10,000 Lakes Music Festival]] in Minnesota with well-known acoustic artist Keller Williams.\n\n===2007===\nThe band announced a few shows for 2007, including their annual Winter Carnival (sans 2006), which stopped in [[Denver]] and [[Vail]], [[Colorado]], and an appearance at the [[Bonnaroo Music Festival]] as well as the [[10,000 Lakes Festival]]. The band concluded their reign among the jamband leadership circuit and rode out into the sunset with a series of shows at their favorite places (New York, San Francisco, Oregon), as well as a revival of the [[Big Summer Classic]] festival at [[Schwagstock|Camp Zoe]], culminating with a last blowout at [[Red Rocks Amphitheatre]] during August 9–12.\n\nThe band had re-recorded their song \"Close Your Eyes\" in [[Simlish]], the native language of [[The Sims]], that was included in the 5th Expansion Pack – Seasons.\n\n===2008===\nAll members were present at the [[Rothbury Music Festival]] in [[Rothbury, Michigan]], performing with their respective solo projects. The Kyle Hollingsworth Band and EOTO performed on Thursday, Panjea with [[Michael Kang (musician)|Michael Kang]] and [[Keller Williams]] featuring [[Keith Moseley]] performed on Friday, and the Emmitt-Nershi Band performed on Saturday. Also, at Yarmony Grass Music Festival all members except for Keith got together and played Will it Go 'Round in Circles together, as well as Pretty Polly.<ref name=setlist.com>{{cite web|author=Kerry Barbato |url=http://setlist.com/YarmonyGrass2008/ |title=For all your setlist needs! |website=Setlist.com |access-date=2017-04-11}}</ref>\n\n===2009===\nOn March 16, 2009, it was announced that the String Cheese Incident would reunite for the second annual Rothbury Festival.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://eventseeker.com/artist/509-the-string-cheese-incident|title=The String Cheese Incident - Artist Profile|website=eventseeker.com|language=en|access-date=2020-02-12}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://glidemagazine.com/141972/rothbury-festival-2009-lineup-announced/|title=Rothbury Festival 2009 Lineup|website=Glide Magazine|date=16 March 2009 |access-date=February 12, 2020}}</ref> The band played an unannounced, invitation-only, \"soundcheck\" show at the [[Ogden Theatre]] in [[Denver]] on June 24.<ref>{{cite web|last=Baca |first=Ricardo |url=http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_12608130 |title=String Cheese Incident to play private Denver gig – The Denver Post |website=Denverpost.com |date=17 June 2009 |access-date=2017-04-11}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2009, Michael Travis told the Colorado Daily newspaper in Boulder: \"We are going to be playing some shows next summer and fall.

An organization called [[Peak Experience Productions]] was hired to add various eye psychedelia, and audience participatory activities, to larger \"Incidents\" such as [[New Year's Eve]] and [[Halloween]] (dubbed \"Hulaween\" due to the band's early connection to the modern [[hooping]] movement). Themed events such as \"Full Moon Dream Dance, Evolution\", \"Dancing Around the Wheel of Time\", a \"Subway Ride Through New York City\", and a \"Time Traveler's Ball\" are some examples.\n\nDuring the 2000s, the band also established an annual summer event at Horning's Hideout in [[Oregon]], bringing Peak Experience out into the woods to add to the circular energy and rapport between the band and its audience. At the same time, as the band's popularity grew, so did the sizes of the crowds coming to see them; SCI headlined festivals such as [[Bonnaroo]], [[Austin City Limits]] and the [[Wakarusa Music and Camping Festival]], and began playing in some larger venues to accommodate their growing fanbase.\n\nSCI released live three-CD sets of all 19 shows that they played in April 2002 on their spring tour. In this regard, they are believed to have taken a cue from [[Phish]]'s ''Live Phish'' series and stepped up the formula a notch by releasing every show instead of just select concerts. Not stopping with the spring tour, SCI has released nearly every song from every concert from every tour through the present, barring those where technical difficulties or contractual guest artist complications are involved. Christening the series ''[[On the Road (String Cheese Incident)|On the Road]]'', the shows are released on the SCI Fidelity label for fans who do not have the time or means to engage in active tape trading.\n\n==Side projects==\nMichael Travis founded the acoustic trio, [[Zuvuya (band)|Zuvuya]], with [[Jamie Janover]] and [[Xander Greene]] in 2001 and started the [[trance music]] band [[Zilla (Band)|Zilla]] during 2003.\n\n[[Bill Nershi]] and his wife [[Jillian Nershi|Jillian]] started a bluegrass/acoustic band called [[Honkytonk Homeslice]], which has toured across the US, especially in the West, and is scheduled to tour with [[Drew Emmitt]] of [[Leftover Salmon]], Billed as [[The Emmitt-Nershi Band]]. Bill Nershi also fronts a side project called Billy Nershi's Blue Planet.\n\n[[Kyle Hollingsworth]] plays with various side projects around [[Colorado]] including his own band, [[Kyle Hollingsworth]], that plays SCI songs Kyle has written over the years as well as some of his other original pieces. His band features members of the Boulder-based group, [[The Motet]].\n\n[[Michael Kang (musician)|Michael Kang]] plays occasionally with Pangaea (African rooted band), and spends much of his off time travelling the world.\n\nIn 2006, [[Jason Hann]] and Michael Travis started a live looping project called [[EOTO]]. One time throughout their 2008 tour they were joined by [[Kyle Hollingsworth]] and [[Michael Kang (musician)|Michael Kang]] making it everyone from SCI except [[Bill Nershi]] and [[Keith Moseley]]. These four played together on August 6, 2011 at Yarmony Grass Music Festival 2011 in [[Rancho del Rio, Colorado]] under the moniker \"The Trancident.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://yarmonygrass.com/fr_home.cfm |title=YarmonyGrass |publisher=YarmonyGrass |access-date=2017-04-11}}</ref> The group went on tour in 2012 with a psychedelic \"Lotus Flower\" stage designed by Zebbler.
