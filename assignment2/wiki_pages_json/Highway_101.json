The initial lineup consisted of [[Paulette Carlson]] (lead vocals), Jack Daniels (guitar), Curtis Stone (bass guitar, vocals), and Scott \"Cactus\" Moser (drums). Prior to the band's founding, Carlson was a solo artist. With her as lead vocalist, the band recorded three albums for [[Warner Bros. Records]] Nashville. After Carlson left in 1990 to pursue a solo career, the band recorded a fourth album for Warner with [[Nikki Nelson]] on lead vocals before exiting the label. One album each followed on [[Liberty Records|Liberty]], [[Intersound Records|Intersound]], and Free Falls Records under various lineups.\n\nHighway 101 has released eight studio albums and one greatest hits album, and has charted seventeen singles on the [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] [[Hot Country Songs]] charts. Four of their singles{{emdash}}\"[[Somewhere Tonight]]\", \"[[Cry, Cry, Cry (Highway 101 song)|Cry, Cry, Cry]]\", \"[[(Do You Love Me) Just Say Yes]]\", and \"[[Who's Lonely Now]]\"{{emdash}} went to number one on that chart.\n\n==History==\nCarlson founded Highway 101 in 1986 in [[Los Angeles, California]], with guitarist Jack Daniels, bassist Curtis Stone (son of song publisher and musician [[Cliffie Stone]]), and drummer Scott \"Cactus\" Moser, all three of whom were [[session musician]]s.<ref name=\"Larkin\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=601}}</ref><ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p1648|pure_url=yes}}|title=Highway 101 biography|last=Huey|first=Steve|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=13 September 2010}}</ref> Stone and Moser (and Cliffie Stone) had appeared in the 1986 film ''[[Back to School]]'' as members of a bar band. Before Highway 101, Carlson recorded as a solo singer on [[RCA Records]]. She made three appearances on the [[Hot Country Songs]] chart for RCA: \"You Gotta Get to My Heart (Before You Lay a Hand on Me)\", \"I'd Say Yes\", and \"Can You Fool\" reached No.&nbsp;65, No.&nbsp;67 and No.&nbsp;72, respectively.<ref>Whitburn, p. 79</ref> \n\n===1986–1990===\nIn 1986, the band signed with [[Warner Bros. Records]] Nashville, debuting with the single \"Some Find Love\". However, it failed to chart and was withdrawn due to the band's dissatisfaction with its [[country pop]] sound.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1987-03-25-8701230184-story.html | title=Highway 101 hit takes long route to top 10 | work=Chicago Tribune | date=March 25, 1987 | accessdate=March 1, 2021}}</ref> They followed up in December 1986 with the single \"[[The Bed You Made for Me]]\", which Carlson wrote.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Single Reviews|date=December 20, 1986|page=65|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}</ref> The song spent twenty-four weeks on the [[Hot Country Songs]] chart, reaching a peak of No.&nbsp;4.<ref name=\"whitburn\"/> Following it were \"Whiskey, If You Were a Woman\" at No.&nbsp;2 and two straight No. 1s: \"[[Somewhere Tonight]]\" (written by [[Rodney Crowell]] and [[Harlan Howard]]) and \"[[Cry, Cry, Cry (Highway 101 song)|Cry, Cry, Cry]]\". After the chart success, Highway 101 was nominated and won the award for Vocal Group of the Year at the 1988 ACM and CMA Awards.\n\n''[[101²]]'' followed in 1988. Its first single, \"[[(Do You Love Me) Just Say Yes]]\". became the band's third straight No. 1 single; following it were the Top 10 hits \"[[All the Reasons Why]]\", \"[[Setting Me Up]]\", and \"[[Honky Tonk Heart]]\", at No.&nbsp;5, No.&nbsp;7 and No.&nbsp;6 respectively.<ref name=\"whitburn\"/> The next year's ''[[Paint the Town]]'' accounted for the band's final Number One, \"[[Who's Lonely Now]]\", followed by \"[[Walkin', Talkin', Cryin', Barely Beatin' Broken Heart]]\" (originally released by [[Johnnie Wright]]) and \"[[This Side of Goodbye]]\".<ref name=\"whitburn\"/> A [[Greatest Hits (Highway 101 album)|''Greatest Hits'']] album in 1990 included the No.&nbsp;14 single \"[[Someone Else's Trouble Now]]\".\n\n===1990–Present: Departure of Carlson===\nIn late 1990, Carlson left the band for a solo career on [[Capitol Records]]. Her solo debut album, ''[[Love Goes On (Paulette Carlson album)|Love Goes On]]'', produced only one top 40 hit in \"I'll Start with You\". Carlson's replacement on lead vocals was [[Nikki Nelson]], who first appeared on 1991's ''[[Bing Bang Boom]]''. Although this album's [[Bing Bang Boom (song)|title track]] made the Top 20, the other singles from it were less successful: \"The Blame\" reached No.&nbsp;31, \"Baby, I'm Missing You\" peaked at No.&nbsp;22, and \"Honky Tonk Baby\" fell short of the Top 40.<ref name=\"whitburn\"/> Daniels left the band in 1992.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/>  After this album, the band left Warner Bros. for [[Liberty Records]]. The only release for this label, ''[[The New Frontier (album)|The New Frontier]]'', included the band's final chart entry, \"You Baby You\", which peaked at No.&nbsp;67.<ref name=\"whitburn\"/>\n\nCarlson and Daniels returned in 1996 for the album ''[[Reunited (Highway 101 album)|Reunited]]'', released via [[Intersound Records]]. \"Where’d You Get Your Cheatin’ From\" and \"It Must Be Love\" were released as singles. In 1998, Carlson and Daniels would both depart Highway 101 once again.\n\nIn 1999, Moser (who was absent from the Reunion album) returned and with Stone, reformed Highway 101 with Charlie White and new vocalist Chrislynn Lee. With FreeFalls, an independent record label, Highway 101 released its seventh studio album, ''Big Sky''. The album also included \"There Goes My Love\", previously recorded with Carlson (1988) and \"I Wonder Where the Love Goes\", previously recorded with Nelson (1993).\n\nWhite departed in 2002 and was replaced with Justin Weaver.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> Lee soon departed as well, and Nelson returned in 2006. In 2007, Weaver departed and was replaced by Andy Gurley. In December 2010, Highway 101 appeared on the Grand Ole Opry and released a special Christmas DVD entitled \"Christmas On Highway 101\". The new DVD featured professionally filmed live performances and guest appearances by country music notables such as [[Wynonna Judd]], to whom Moser is married.\n\nIn August 2012, Moser was involved in a motorcycle accident which resulted in the amputation of his left leg above the knee.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-xpm-2012-aug-20-la-et-mg-wynonna-judd-husband-cactus-moser-leg-amputated-story.html|title=Wynonna Judd's husband, Cactus Moser, loses leg in motorcycle wreck|date=August 20, 2012|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref>\n\n==Members==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n{| class=\"toccolours\"  border=1 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0 style=\"width: 375px; margin: 0 0 1em 1em; border-collapse: collapse; border: 1px solid #E2E2E2;margin:auto;\"\n|-\n!
