The album featured four singles, three of which made the top 40. The album debuted at No.&nbsp;1 on the Country charts, and No.&nbsp;3 on the ''Billboard'' 200. By the end of the year, ''It Won't Be the Last'' was certified platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]. The highest-charting single, the lead-off single, \"[[In the Heart of a Woman]]\", charted to No. 3, with \"[[Somebody New (Billy Ray Cyrus song)|Somebody New]]\" charting to No. 9, \"Words By Heart\" at No. 12, and \"Talk Some\" at No. 63. Also in 1993, Cyrus appeared on [[Dolly Parton]]'s single \"[[Slow Dancing with the Moon|Romeo]]\"; though the single only reached 27 on the country singles charts, the accompanying video was popular on [[Country Music Television|CMT]].\n\nCyrus' third studio album, ''[[Storm in the Heartland]]'', was released in 1994. It was the final album he recorded for PolyGram, which closed its doors in 1995. The album was not as successful as its predecessors. It only reached No. 11 on the Country albums chart, and only the title track made the top 40 of the Country singles chart. \"Deja Blue\" was the second single released; however, it only managed to chart to No. 66, and the third and final single, \"One Last Thrill\", failed to chart at all.\n\nThe album managed to be certified gold in the U.S. Before Cyrus started on his next album, he was transferred to [[Universal Music Group Nashville|Mercury Nashville]].\n\nAlso in 1994, Cyrus contributed the song \"Pictures Don't Lie\" to the [[AIDS]] benefit album [[Red Hot + Country]] produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]].\n\nCyrus' most critically acclaimed album was 1996's ''[[Trail of Tears (Billy Ray Cyrus album)|Trail of Tears]]'' for Mercury Records. The album debuted at No. 20 on the Country chart. Only two songs made the cut to radio, neither of which hit the top 40. The title track and \"Three Little Words\" reached No. 69 and No. 65 respectively. The album failed to reach any certification, and was off the charts after only four weeks.\n\nIn 1998, Cyrus released his last album for Mercury Records ''[[Shot Full of Love]]''. The album became his lowest-peaking album, debuting at No. 32. The first single, \"Under the Hood\", failed to chart, \"Time for Letting Go\" hit No. 70, \"[[Busy Man]]\" charted No. 3, and \"I Give My Heart to You\" reached No. 41. After the single fell from the charts, Cyrus left Mercury and signed with [[Monument Records]] in 1999.\n\nHis debut album for Monument, ''[[Southern Rain]]'', was released in 2000. It debuted at No. 13 on the Country albums chart and No. 102 on the ''Billboard'' 200. Five singles were released and all five charted. The lead-off single, \"[[You Won't Be Lonely Now]]\", was the highest-peaking single from the album, charting to No. 17. Other singles include \"We the People\" (No. 60), \"Burn Down the Trailer Park\" (No. 43), \"Crazy 'Bout You Baby\" (No. 58), and the title track (No. 45).\n\n===Shift to Christian music===\nAfter the singles from ''Southern Rain'' finished their chart runs, Cyrus recorded two Christian albums. Both albums, ''[[Time Flies (Billy Ray Cyrus album)|Time Flies]]'' and ''[[The Other Side (Billy Ray Cyrus album)|The Other Side]]'', were released in 2003. The first album debuted and peaked at a low No.&nbsp;56 on the Country album charts. Three singles were released; however, only the final single reached the charts. \"Bread Alone\", \"What Else Is There\", and \"Back to Memphis\" were released, and \"Back to Memphis\" charted to No.&nbsp;60.\n\nThe second Christian album, ''The Other Side'', was recorded while Cyrus filmed his [[PAX (TV network)|PAX]] series, ''[[Doc (2001 TV series)|Doc]]''. It debuted at No.&nbsp;5 on the [[Top Christian Albums]] chart, No.&nbsp;18 Top Country Albums, and No.&nbsp;131 on ''Billboard'' 200. Two of three singles charted – \"Face of God\" (No. 54) and \"The Other Side\" (No. 45) – while \"Always Sixteen\" did not chart.\n\n===Disney Entertainment===\nThe album ''[[Wanna Be Your Joe]]'' was Billy Ray's first country album since 2000's ''Southern Rain''. It was again recorded on a new record label: New Door/UMe Records. It was released while Cyrus was filming the show ''[[Hannah Montana]]''. ''Wanna Be Your Joe'' made it to No.&nbsp;24 on the Country charts and No.&nbsp;113 on the all-genre charts. The album initially sold well, but no hit-single was released. The title track was released as the first single, and was followed by \"I Want My Mullet Back\", both of which were ignored by country radio. Although not released as a single, a music video was made for the track \"Stand\", a duet with daughter [[Miley Cyrus]].\n\nAlso in 2006, Billy Ray appeared with metal-rock group [[Metal Skool]] (now [[Steel Panther]]), and performed several songs including \"[[Rebel Yell (song)|Rebel Yell]]\" by [[Billy Idol]], and the song \"I Want My Mullet Back\", which appears on ''Wanna Be Your Joe''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bpah6c4plII |title=Billy Ray & Metal Skool |publisher=YouTube |date=November 1, 2006 |access-date=August 29, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140924165227/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bpah6c4plII |archive-date=September 24, 2014 |url-status=live  }}</ref>\n\nHe also sang \"[[The Star-Spangled Banner|The Star Spangled Banner]]\" at Game 5 of the [[2006 World Series]] in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]].\n\n===Career re-launch===\nIn mid-2007, Cyrus was a celebrity contestant on the 4th season of the show ''[[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 4)|Dancing with the Stars]]''. Cyrus was partnered with [[Karina Smirnoff]]. He quickly became a fan favorite. Cyrus and Smirnoff made it to the semi-finals, where they finished in 5th place.\n\nFrom Cyrus's exposure on ''[[Dancing with the Stars]]'' and ''[[Hannah Montana]]'', his record label pushed up the release date by a month for his new album. ''[[Home at Last (Billy Ray Cyrus album)|Home at Last]]'' was released in July 2007 on [[Walt Disney Records]]. It debuted at No.&nbsp;3 on the country charts, making it Cyrus' first top 5 entry since 1993. Beginning sales for the album were very strong; however, the album failed to be certified. The single \"[[Ready, Set, Don't Go]]\", was initially released as a solo single. The solo version made it to No.&nbsp;33 on the Hot Country Songs chart.\n\nIn October 2007, Cyrus and his daughter [[Miley Cyrus|Miley]] performed a duet of the song on ''Dancing with the Stars''. The duet debuted at No.&nbsp;27 on the Country charts and eventually peaked at No.&nbsp;4 in 2008, giving Billy Ray his first top 5 single since 1999, as well as Miley's first top 5 on any ''Billboard'' chart.\n\nCyrus was a part of the Disney collection ''[[Country Sings Disney]]'' in 2008. Two of his songs, \"Ready, Set, Don't Go\" and the [[Sheryl Crow]]-penned song \"[[Real Gone (song)|Real Gone]]\", appeared on the album. Billy Ray's version of \"Real Gone\" was also made into a music video that is in rotation on both [[Country Music Television|CMT]] and [[Great American Country|GAC]]; the song also appears on ''[[Back to Tennessee]]''.\n\n=== New label and newfound chart success ===\n[[File:Billy Ray Cyrus at Kids Inaugural Concert.jpg|thumb|Cyrus singing at the ''Kids Inaugural Event'' in January 2009]]\n\nIn late 2008, his website announced that a new studio album would be released by the end of the year from [[Lyric Street Records]], entitled ''[[Back to Tennessee]]''.

A third single, \"[[A Good Day (song)|A Good Day]]\", debuted at No. 60 on the country charts for the chart week of September 5, 2009.\n\nIt was less successful in its first week out as ''Home at Last''. It only reached No.&nbsp;13 on the charts and only sold approximately 14,000 copies in its opening week. The album's release date coincided with the release of ''[[Hannah Montana: The Movie]]''. The song \"Back to Tennessee\" was included on the [[Hannah Montana: The Movie (soundtrack)|movie's soundtrack]], as well as a duet with [[Miley Cyrus]], entitled \"[[Butterfly Fly Away]]\". The latter song would peak at No. 56 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and at No. 50 and [[Canadian Hot 100]].\n\nOn November 12, 2008, Billy Ray and Miley presented the \"Song of the Year\" award at the 42nd Annual [[Country Music Association Awards]].
