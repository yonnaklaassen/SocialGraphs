In December 1969, he held the recording sessions for his second album there. Titled ''[[Sweet Baby James]]'', and featuring the participation of [[Carole King]], the album was released in February 1970 and was Taylor's critical and popular breakthrough, buoyed by the single \"[[Fire and Rain (song)|Fire and Rain]]\", a song about both Taylor's experiences attempting to break his drug habit by undergoing treatment in psychiatric institutions and the suicide of his friend Suzanne Schnerr. Both the album and the single reached {{numero|3}} on the ''Billboard'' charts, with ''Sweet Baby James'' selling more than 1.5&nbsp;million copies in its first year<ref name=\"time-cover-story\"/> and eventually more than 3 million in the United States alone. ''Sweet Baby James'' was received at its time as a folk-rock masterpiece, an album that effectively showcased Taylor's talents to the mainstream public, marking a direction he would take in following years. It earned several Grammy Award nominations including one for [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]]. It went on to be listed at {{numero|103}} on [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time]] in 2003, with \"Fire and Rain\" listed as {{numero|227}} on [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]] in 2004.\n\nDuring the time that ''Sweet Baby James'' was released, Taylor appeared with [[Dennis Wilson]] of [[the Beach Boys]] in a [[Monte Hellman]] film, ''[[Two-Lane Blacktop]]''. In October 1970, he performed with his then partner [[Joni Mitchell]], [[Phil Ochs]], and the Canadian band [[Chilliwack (band)|Chilliwack]] at a [[Vancouver]] benefit concert that funded [[Greenpeace]]'s protests of [[Amchitka#Milrow and Cannikin tests|1971 nuclear weapons tests]] by the [[US Atomic Energy Commission]] at [[Amchitka]], [[Alaska]]; this performance was released in album format in 2009 as ''[[Amchitka (album)|Amchitka, The 1970 Concert That Launched Greenpeace]]''. In January 1971, sessions for Taylor's next album began.\n\nHe appeared on ''[[The Johnny Cash Show (TV series)|The Johnny Cash Show]]'', singing \"Sweet Baby James\", \"Fire and Rain\", and \"Country Road\", on February 17, 1971. His career success at this point and appeal to female fans of various ages piqued tremendous interest in him, prompting a March 1, 1971, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine cover story of him as \"the face of new rock\".<ref name=\"time-cover-story\"/> It compared his strong-but-brooding persona to that of ''[[Wuthering Heights]]''{{'}} [[Heathcliff (Wuthering Heights)|Heathcliff]] and to ''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]'', and said, \"Taylor's use of elemental imagery—darkness and sunlight, references to roads traveled and untraveled, to fears spoken and left unsaid—reaches a level both of intimacy and controlled emotion rarely achieved in purely pop music.\"<ref name=\"time-cover-story\"/> One of the writers described his look as \"a cowboy Jesus\", to which Taylor later replied, \"I thought I was trying to look like George Harrison.\"<ref>''CBS Early This Morning'', musician James Taylor, December 5, 2016</ref>\n[[File:James Taylor Billboard 1971.jpg|left|thumb|293x293px|Taylor in a publicity photograph for his 1971 studio album ''[[Mud Slide Slim and the Blue Horizon]]'']]\nReleased in April 1971, ''[[Mud Slide Slim and the Blue Horizon]]'' also gained critical acclaim and contained Taylor's biggest hit single in the US, a version of Carole King's new \"[[You've Got a Friend]]\" (featuring backing vocals by [[Joni Mitchell]]), which reached {{numero|1}} on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 in late July. The follow-up single, \"[[Long Ago and Far Away (James Taylor song)|Long Ago and Far Away]]\", also made the Top 40 and reached {{numero|4}} on the ''Billboard'' [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]] chart. The album itself reached {{numero|2}} on the album charts, which would be Taylor's highest position ever until the release of his 2015 album, ''Before This World'', which went to {{numero|1}} superseding [[Taylor Swift]]. In early 1972, Taylor won his first Grammy Award for [[Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance|Best Pop Vocal Performance, Male]], for \"You've Got a Friend\"; King also won [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]] for the same song in that ceremony. The album went on to sell 2.5&nbsp;million copies in the United States.\n\nNovember 1972 heralded the release of Taylor's fourth album, ''[[One Man Dog]]''. A [[concept album]] primarily recorded in his home recording studio, it featured a cameo by [[Linda Ronstadt]] along with Carole King, Carly Simon, and [[John McLaughlin (musician)|John McLaughlin]]. The album consisted of eighteen short pieces of music put together. Reception was generally lukewarm and, despite making the Top 10 of the ''Billboard'' Album Charts, its overall sales were disappointing. The lead single, \"[[Don't Let Me Be Lonely Tonight]]\", peaked at {{numero|14}} on the Hot 100, and the follow-up, \"[[One Man Parade]]\", barely reached the Top 75. Almost simultaneously, Taylor married fellow singer-songwriter [[Carly Simon]] on November 3, in a small ceremony at her [[Murray Hill, Manhattan]] apartment.<ref name=\"white-208\">White, ''Long Ago and Far Away'', p. 208.</ref> A post-concert party following a Taylor performance at [[Radio City Music Hall]] turned into a large-scale wedding party, and the Simon-Taylor marriage would find much public attention over the following years.<ref name=\"white-208\"/> They had two children, [[Sally Taylor (musician)|Sarah Maria \"Sally\" Taylor]], born January 7, 1974, and Benjamin Simon \"Ben\" Taylor, born January 22, 1977.<ref>White, ''Long Ago and Far Away'', pp. 216, 243.</ref> During their marriage, the couple would guest on each other's albums and have two hit singles as duet partners: a cover of Inez & Charlie Foxx's \"[[Mockingbird (Inez & Charlie Foxx song)#1970s: Carly Simon and James Taylor|Mockingbird]]\" and a version of The Everly Brothers' \"[[Devoted to You (song)#Carly Simon and James Taylor version|Devoted to You]]\".\n\n===1973–1976: Continued success and ''Greatest Hits''===\nTaylor spent most of 1973 enjoying his new life as a married man and did not return to the recording studio until January 1974, when sessions for his fifth album began. ''[[Walking Man]]'' was released in June and featured appearances of Paul and [[Linda McCartney]] and guitarist [[David Spinozza]]. The album was a critical and commercial disaster and was his first album to miss the Top 5 since his contract with Warner. It received poor reviews and sold only 300,000 copies in the United States. The title track failed to appear on the Top 100.\n\n[[File:James Taylor and Carly Simon, 1975.jpg|thumb|Taylor and Simon in concert, 1975]]\nHowever, Taylor's artistic fortunes spiked again in 1975 when the Gold album ''[[Gorilla (James Taylor album)|Gorilla]]'' reached {{numero|6}} and provided one of his biggest hit singles, a version of [[Marvin Gaye]]'s \"[[How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved by You)]]\", featuring wife Carly on backing vocals and reached {{numero|5}} in America and {{numero|1}} in Canada. On the ''Billboard'' Adult Contemporary chart, the track also reached the top, and the follow-up single, the feelgood \"Mexico\", featuring a guest appearance by [[Crosby & Nash]], also reached the Top 5 of that list. A well-received album, ''Gorilla'' showcased Taylor's electric, lighter side that was evident on ''Walking Man''. However, it was arguably a more consistent and fresher-sounding Taylor, with songs such as \"Mexico\", \"Wandering\" and \"Angry Blues\". It also featured a song about his daughter Sally, \"Sarah Maria\".\n\n''Gorilla'' was followed in 1976 by ''[[In the Pocket (James Taylor album)|In the Pocket]]'', Taylor's last studio album to be released under [[Warner Bros. Records]]. The album found him with many colleagues and friends, including [[Art Garfunkel]], [[David Crosby]], [[Bonnie Raitt]], and [[Stevie Wonder]] (who co-wrote a song with Taylor and contributed a harmonica solo). A melodic album, it was highlighted with the single \"[[Shower the People]]\", an enduring song that hit {{numero|1}} on the Adult Contemporary chart and hit 22 on the Pop Charts. However, the album was not well received, reaching {{numero|16}} and being criticized, particularly by ''Rolling Stone''. Still, ''In The Pocket'' went on to be certified gold.\n\nWith the close of Taylor's contract with Warner, in November, the label released ''[[Greatest Hits (James Taylor album)|Greatest Hits]]'', the album that comprised most of his best work between 1970 and 1976. With time, it became his best-selling album ever. It was certified 11× Platinum in the US, earned a Diamond certification by the [[RIAA]], and eventually sold close to 20 million copies worldwide.\n\n===1977–1981: Move to Columbia Records===\nIn 1977 Taylor signed with [[Columbia Records]]. Between March and April, he quickly recorded his first album for the label. ''[[JT (album)|JT]]'', released that June, gave Taylor his best reviews since ''Sweet Baby James'', earning a Grammy nomination for Album of the Year in 1978. Peter Herbst of ''Rolling Stone'' was particularly favorable to the album, of which he wrote in its August 11, 1977, issue, \"''JT'' is the least stiff and by far the most various album Taylor has done. That's not meant to criticize Taylor's earlier efforts. ... But it's nice to hear him sounding so healthy.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Herbst |first=Peter |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/jt-19770811 |title=James Taylor JT Album Review |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=August 11, 1977 |access-date=August 25, 2015 |archive-date=August 28, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150828000231/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/jt-19770811 |url-status=live }}</ref> ''JT'' reached {{numero|4}} on the ''Billboard'' charts and sold more than 3 million copies in the United States alone. The album's Triple Platinum status ties it with ''Sweet Baby James'' as Taylor's all-time biggest-selling studio album. It was propelled by [[Jimmy Jones (singer)|Jimmy Jones]]'s and [[Otis Blackwell]]'s \"[[Handy Man (song)|Handy Man]]\", which hit {{numero|1}} on ''Billboard'''s Adult Contemporary chart and reached {{numero|4}} on the Hot 100, earning Taylor another [[Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance]]. The song also topped the Canadian charts. The success of the album propelled the release of two further singles; the up-tempo pop \"[[Your Smiling Face]]\", an enduring live favorite, reached the American Top 20; however, \"[[Honey Don't Leave L.A.]]\", which [[Danny Kortchmar]] wrote and composed for Taylor, did not enjoy much success, reaching only {{numero|61}}.\n\nBack in the forefront of popular music, Taylor guested with [[Paul Simon]] on Art Garfunkel's recording of [[Sam Cooke]]'s \"[[Wonderful World (Sam Cooke song)|Wonderful World]]\", which reached the Top 20 in the U.S. and topped the [[CCM AC chart|AC charts]] in early 1978. After briefly working on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], he took a one-year break, reappearing in the summer of 1979, with the cover-studded Platinum album titled ''[[Flag (James Taylor album)|Flag]]'', featuring a Top 30 version of [[Gerry Goffin]]'s and Carole King's \"[[Up on the Roof (song)|Up on the Roof]]\". (Two selections from ''Flag'', \"[[Millworker]]\" and \"Brother Trucker\" were featured on the PBS production of [[Working (musical)|the Broadway musical]] based on [[Studs Terkel]]'s non-fiction book ''[[Working: People Talk About What They Do All Day and How They Feel About What They Do|Working]]'', which Terkel himself hosted. Taylor himself appeared in that production as a trucker; he performed \"Brother Trucker\" in character.) Taylor also appeared on the [[Musicians United for Safe Energy|No Nukes]] concert in Madison Square Garden, where he made a memorable live performance of \"Mockingbird\" with his wife Carly. The concert appeared on both the [[No Nukes (album)|''No Nukes'' album]] and [[No Nukes (film)|film]].\n\nOn December 7, 1980, Taylor had an encounter with [[Mark David Chapman]] who would [[Murder of John Lennon|murder John Lennon]] just one day later. Taylor told the BBC in 2010: \"The guy had sort of pinned me to the wall and was glistening with maniacal sweat and talking some freak speak about what he was going to do and his stuff with how John was interested, and he was going to get in touch with John Lennon. And it was surreal to actually have contact with the guy 24 hours before he shot John.\" The next night, Taylor, who lived in a building next-door to Lennon, heard the assassination occur. Taylor commented: \"I heard him shoot—five, just as quick as you could pull the trigger, about five explosions.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-11926898 |title=Lennon's death: I was there – BBC News |work=BBC News |date=December 8, 2010 |access-date=June 17, 2015 |archive-date=April 6, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150406123437/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-11926898 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn March 1981, Taylor released the album ''[[Dad Loves His Work]]'' whose themes concerned his relationship with his father, the course his ancestors had taken, and the effect that he and Simon had on each other.<ref>White, ''Long Ago and Far Away'', pp. 275–276.</ref> The album was another Platinum success, reaching {{numero|10}} and providing Taylor's final real hit single in a duet with [[JD Souther]], \"[[Her Town Too]]\", which reached {{numero|5}} on the Adult Contemporary chart and {{numero|11}} on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100.\n\n===1981–1996: Troubled times and new beginnings===\n[[File:James Taylor - Winterfest.jpg|thumb|Taylor at Winterfest, 1985|251x251px]]\nSimon announced her separation from Taylor in September 1981 saying, \"Our needs are different; it seem[s] impossible to stay together\" and their divorce finalized in 1983.<ref>White, ''Long Ago and Far Away'', pp. 279–280, 286.</ref> Their breakup was highly publicized.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.grabow.biz/Book-James_Taylor-Booking-Information-893.html |title=James Taylor Booking Agent – Corporate Event Booking Agent |publisher=Grabow.biz |access-date=June 17, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150608134148/http://www.grabow.biz/Book-James_Taylor-Booking-Information-893.html |archive-date=June 8, 2015 }}</ref> At the time, Taylor was living on [[West End Avenue]] in Manhattan and on a [[methadone]] maintenance program to cure him of his [[drug addiction]].<ref name=\"white-281\">White, ''Long Ago and Far Away'', pp. 281–286.</ref> Over the course of four months starting in September 1983, spurred on in part by the deaths of his friends [[John Belushi]] and [[Dennis Wilson]] and in part by the desire to be a better father to his children [[Sally Taylor (musician)|Sally]] and Ben, he discontinued methadone and overcame his heroin habit.<ref name=\"white-281\"/>\n\nTaylor had thoughts of retiring by the time he played the [[Rock in Rio]] festival in [[Rio de Janeiro]] in January 1985.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nme.com/reviews/sting/3799 | title=Sting and James Taylor get Rock in Rio off to a gentle start |author=[[Valeria Rossi|Rossi, Valeria]] |author2=[[:pt:Luciano Vianna|Vianna, Luciano]] |work=[[NME]] | date=January 13, 2001 | access-date=March 17, 2009 | archive-date=December 2, 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091202113706/http://www.nme.com/reviews/sting/3799 | url-status=live }}</ref> He was encouraged by the nascent democracy in Brazil at the time, buoyed by the positive reception he got from the large crowd and other musicians, and musically energized by the sounds and nature of [[Brazilian music]].<ref name=\"white-287\">White, ''Long Ago and Far Away'', pp. 287–288.</ref> \"I had ... sort of bottomed-out in a drug habit, my marriage with Carly had dissolved, and I had basically been depressed and lost for a while\", he recalled in 1995:\n\n{{blockquote|I sort of hit a low spot.

On the album track \"Only One\", the backing vocals were performed by an all-star duo of Joni Mitchell and Don Henley.{{citation needed|date=December 2022}}\n\nTaylor's next albums were partially successful; in 1988, he released ''[[Never Die Young]]'', highlighted with the charting title track, and in 1991, the platinum ''[[New Moon Shine]]'' provided Taylor some popular songs with \"Copperline\" and \"(I've Got to) Stop Thinkin' About That\", both hit singles on Adult Contemporary radio. In the late 1980s, he began touring regularly, especially on the summer [[amphitheater]] circuit. His later concerts feature songs spanning his career and are marked by the musicianship of his band and backup singers. The 1993 two-disc ''[[Live (James Taylor album)|Live]]'' album captures this, with a highlight being [[Arnold McCuller]]'s [[descant]]s in the [[coda (music)|codas]] of \"[[Shower the People]]\" and \"I Will Follow\". He provided a guest voice to ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode \"[[Deep Space Homer]]\", and also appeared later on in the series when the family put together a jigsaw puzzle with his face as the missing final piece. In 1995, Taylor performed the role of the Lord in ''[[Randy Newman's Faust]]''.\n\n===1997–present: Current ventures===\n\n==== 1997–2008 ====\n[[File:JamesTaylor 02.jpg|thumb|Taylor in concert at DeVos Hall, Grand Rapids, Michigan – April 2006]]\nIn 1997, after six years since his last studio album, Taylor released ''[[Hourglass (James Taylor album)|Hourglass]]'', an introspective album that gave him the best critical reviews in almost twenty years.

The album also gave Taylor his first Grammy since ''JT'', when he was honored with [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album|Best Pop Album]] in 1998.\n\nFlanked by two greatest hit releases, Taylor's Platinum-certified ''[[October Road (album)|October Road]]'' appeared in 2002 to a receptive audience.

They later recorded the [[Louvin Brothers]] duet, \"How's the World Treating You?\" In 2004, after he chose not to renew his record contract with Columbia/Sony, he released ''[[James Taylor: A Christmas Album]]'' with distribution through [[Hallmark Cards]].\n\n[[File:James Taylor at Tanglewood.jpg|thumb|240px|Taylor performing at Tanglewood in 2008]]\nAlways visibly active in [[Political ecology|environmental]] and liberal causes, in October 2004, Taylor joined the [[Vote for Change]] tour playing a series of concerts in American [[swing states]]. These concerts were organized by [[MoveOn.org]] with the goal of mobilizing people to vote for [[John Kerry]] and against [[George W. Bush]] in that year's presidential campaign. Taylor's appearances were joint performances with the [[Dixie Chicks]].\n\nTaylor performed \"[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]\" at Game 2 of the [[World Series]] in Boston on October 24, 2004, on October 25, 2007, both the anthem and \"America\" for the game on October 24, 2013, and Game 1 on October 23, 2018. He also performed at Game 1 of the [[2008 NBA Finals]] in Boston on June 5, 2008, and at the [[2010 NHL Winter Classic|NHL's Winter Classic]] game between the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] and [[Boston Bruins]].{{citation needed|date=July 2022}}\n\nIn December 2004, he appeared as himself in an episode of ''[[The West Wing (TV series)|The West Wing]]'' entitled \"[[A Change Is Gonna Come (The West Wing)|A Change Is Gonna Come]]\". He sang [[Sam Cooke]]'s classic \"[[A Change Is Gonna Come (song)|A Change Is Gonna Come]]\" at an event honoring an artist played by Taylor's wife Caroline. Later on, he appeared on [[Country Music Television|CMT]]'s ''Crossroads'' alongside the Dixie Chicks. In early 2006, [[MusiCares]] honored Taylor with performances of his songs by an array of notable musicians.

The song was nominated for the 2007 [[Academy Award]] for the Best Original Song. On January 1, 2007, Taylor headlined the inaugural concert at the [[Times Union Center]] in [[Albany, New York]] honoring newly sworn in [[Governor of New York]] [[Eliot Spitzer]].\n\nTaylor's next album, ''[[One Man Band (James Taylor album)|One Man Band]]'' was released on CD and DVD in November 2007 on [[Starbucks]]' [[Hear Music]] Label, where he joined with [[Paul McCartney]] and [[Joni Mitchell]]. The introspective album grew out of a three-year tour of the United States and Europe called the One Man Band Tour, featuring some of Taylor's most beloved songs and anecdotes about their creative origins—accompanied solely by the \"one man band\" of his longtime pianist/keyboardist, [[Larry Goldings]]. The [[Surround sound#5.1 Channel Surround (3-2 Stereo) (digital discrete: Dolby Digital, DTS, SDDS, Penteo)|digital discrete 5.1 surround sound]] mix of ''One Man Band'' won a [[TEC Awards|TEC Award]] for best surround sound recording in 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://legacy.tecawards.org/tec/08winners.html |title=The 2008 TEC Awards Winners |publisher=Legacy.tecawards.org |access-date=August 25, 2015 |archive-date=March 4, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304120303/http://legacy.tecawards.org/tec/08winners.html |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n[[File:You've Got a Friend JT CK 2010.jpg|thumb|left|Taylor and [[Carole King]] performing \"[[You've Got a Friend]]\" together during their [[Troubadour Reunion Tour]] in 2010]]\nOn November 28–30, 2007, Taylor accompanied by his original band and Carole King, headlined a series of six shows at the Troubadour. The appearances marked the 50th anniversary of the venue, where Taylor, King and many others, such as [[Tom Waits]], [[Neil Diamond]], and [[Elton John]], performed early in their music careers. Proceeds from the concert went to benefit the Natural Resources Defense Council, MusiCares, Alliance for the Wild Rockies, and the Los Angeles Regional Foodbank (a member of [[America's Second Harvest]], the nation's Food Bank Network). Parts of the performance shown on ''[[CBS Sunday Morning]]'' in the December 23, 2007, broadcast showed Taylor alluding to his early drug problems by saying, \"I played here a number of times in the 70s, allegedly\". Taylor has used versions of this joke on other occasions, and it appears as part of his ''One Man Band'' DVD and tour performances.\n\nIn December 2007, ''James Taylor at Christmas'' was nominated for a Grammy Award.  In January 2008, Taylor recorded approximately 20 songs by others for a new album with a band including [[Luis Conte]], [[Michael Landau]], [[Lou Marini]], [[Arnold McCuller]], [[Jimmy Johnson (bassist)|Jimmy Johnson]], [[David Lasley]], Walt Fowler, [[Andrea Zonn]], [[Kate Markowitz]], [[Steve Gadd]] and [[Larry Goldings]].
