After co-writing the [[Mickey Gilley]] hit \"[[I'm the One Mama Warned You About]]\" (credited as Gayle Zeiler), she found success as a performer through the band Ethel & The Shameless Hussies, with whom she released her first album. Later, in 1997, she released her first solo album, ''Men Are Some of My Favorite People'', through [[Curb Records]], before founding her own label, IGO Records, co-founding the Kinkajou Records label with [[Kinky Friedman]] and creating two publishing houses—Zamalama Music and Mamalama Music.
