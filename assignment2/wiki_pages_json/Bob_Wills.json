Oklahoma guitar player Eldon Shamblin joined the band in 1937 bringing jazzy influence and arrangements. The band played regularly on Tulsa, Oklahoma, radio station [[KTSB (AM)|KVOO]] and added [[Leon McAuliffe]] on steel guitar, pianist Al Stricklin, drummer Smokey Dacus, and a horn section that expanded the band's sound. Wills favored jazz-like arrangements and the band found national popularity into the 1940s with such hits as \"[[Steel Guitar Rag]]\", \"[[San Antonio Rose]]\", \"[[Smoke on the Water (Red Foley song)|Smoke on the Water]]\", \"[[Stars and Stripes on Iwo Jima]]\", and \"[[New Spanish Two Step]]\".\n\nWills and the Texas Playboys recorded with several publishers and companies, including [[Vocalion Records|Vocalion]], [[Okeh]], [[Columbia Records|Columbia]], and [[MGM]]. In 1950, Wills had two top 10 hits, \"Ida Red likes the Boogie\" and \"[[Faded Love (Bob Wills song)|Faded Love]]\", which were his last hits for a decade. Throughout the 1950s, he struggled with poor health and tenuous finances. He continued to perform frequently despite a decline in the popularity of his earlier hit songs, and the growing popularity of rock and roll. Wills had a heart attack in 1962, and a second one the next year, which forced him to disband the Texas Playboys. Wills continued to perform solo.\n\nThe [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] inducted Wills in 1968 and the Texas State Legislature honored him for his contribution to American music. In 1972, Wills accepted a citation from the [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers]] in Nashville. He recorded an album with fan [[Merle Haggard]] in 1973. Wills suffered two strokes that left him partially paralyzed, and unable to communicate. He was comatose the last two months of his life, and died in a Fort Worth nursing home in 1975.<ref>{{cite news |title=14 May 1975, Page 10 - The Galveston Daily News at Newspapers.com |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/20805930/?terms=bob%20wills&match=1 |access-date=16 July 2022 |work=Newspapers.com}}</ref> The [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] inducted Wills and the Texas Playboys in 1999.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early years===\nHe was born on a cotton farm in [[Kosse, Texas]],<ref>[http://www.wideopencountry.com/bob-wills-turkey-texas/ This Tiny Texas Town is a Must-See for Bob Wills Fans] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180414011733/http://www.wideopencountry.com/bob-wills-turkey-texas/ |date=April 14, 2018 }} Retrieved 2018-04-13.</ref> to Emma Lee Foley and John Tompkins Wills.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wargs.com/other/wills.html|title=Ancestry of Bob Wills|publisher=Wargs.com|access-date=2010-05-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070914062058/http://www.wargs.com/other/wills.html|archive-date=September 14, 2007|url-status=live}}</ref> His parents were both of primarily [[English American|English ancestry]] but had distant [[Irish American|Irish ancestry]] as well.<ref>San Antonio Rose: The Life and Music of Bob Wills by Charles Townsend and Charles R.

There he played in [[minstrel show|minstrel]] and [[medicine show]]s, and, as with other Texas musicians such as Ocie Stockard, continued to earn money as a barber. He wore [[blackface]] makeup to appear in comedy routines, something that was common at the time.

In 1930 [[Milton Brown]] joined the group as lead vocalist and brought a sense of innovation and experimentation to the band, which became known as the Aladdin Laddies and then soon renamed itself the [[Light Crust Doughboys]] because of radio sponsorship by the makers of Light Crust Flour. Brown left the band in 1932 to form the Musical Brownies, the first true [[Western swing]] band. Brown added twin fiddles, tenor banjo and slap bass, pointing the music in the direction of swing, which they played on local radio and at dancehalls.<ref name=\"TMHO\">{{cite web|url=http://ctmh.its.txstate.edu/artist.php?cmd=detail&aid=25|title=Texas Music History Online|work=ctmh.its.txstate.edu|access-date=May 2, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071102200900/http://ctmh.its.txstate.edu/artist.php?cmd=detail&aid=25|archive-date=November 2, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===The Texas Playboys===\n[[File:Bob Wills Texas Playboys Publicity Photo - Cropped.jpg|thumb|Bob Wills and his [[Texas Playboys]]|300px]]\nAfter forming a new band, The Playboys, and relocating to Waco, Texas, Wills found enough popularity there to decide on a bigger market.

Stover, thinking he had been hired as a trumpeter, began playing with the band, and Wills never stopped him. Although Wills initially disapproved of it, young saxophonist Zeb McNally was eventually hired.

According to Opry policy, drums and horns were considered pop instruments, inappropriate to country music. The Opry had two western swing bands on its roster, led by [[Pee Wee King]] and [[Paul Howard (musician)|Paul Howard]]. Neither were allowed to use their drummers at the Opry. Wills' band at the time consisted of two fiddlers, two bass fiddles, two electric guitars, electric steel guitar, and a trumpet. Wills's then-drummer was Monte Mountjoy, who played in the Dixieland style. Wills battled Opry officials and refused to perform without his drummer.

Charles R. Townsend described his drop in popularity: Bob could draw \"a thousand people on Monday night between 1950 and 1952, but he could not do that by 1956. Entertainment habits had changed.\"<ref>''San Antonio Rose: The Life and Music of Bob Wills''. Charles R. Townsend. 1976.

The article quotes Wills as saying \"Rock and roll? Why, man, that's the same kind of music we've been playin' since 1928!&nbsp;... We didn't call it rock and roll back when we introduced it as our style back in 1928, and we don't call it rock and roll the way we play it now. But it's just basic rhythm and has gone by a lot of different names in my time. It's the same, whether you just follow a drum beat like in Africa or surround it with a lot of instruments. The rhythm's what's important.\"<ref>''San Antonio Rose: The Life and Music of Bob Wills''. Charles R. Townsend. 1976.

He appeared twice on ABC-TV's ''[[Jubilee USA (TV series)|Jubilee USA]]'' and kept the band on the road into the 1960s. After two heart attacks, in 1965 he dissolved the Texas Playboys (who briefly continued as an independent unit) to perform solo with house bands. While he did well in Las Vegas and other areas, and made records for the [[Kapp Records]] label, he was largely a forgotten figure—even though inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum|Country Music Hall of Fame]] in 1968. A 1969 stroke left his right side paralyzed, ending his active career. He did, however, recover sufficiently to appear in a wheelchair at various Wills tributes held in the early 1970s. A revival of interest in his music, spurred by [[Merle Haggard]]'s 1970 album ''[[A Tribute to the Best Damn Fiddle Player in the World]]'', led to a 1973 reunion album, teaming Wills, who spoke with difficulty, with key members of the early band, as well as Haggard.\n\nWills died in Fort Worth of [[pneumonia]] on May 13, 1975.<ref>\"Milestones\".

A 1970 tribute album by Haggard, ''[[A Tribute to the Best Damn Fiddle Player in the World (or, My Salute to Bob Wills)]]'' directed a wider audience to Wills's music, as did the appearance of younger \"revival\" bands like [[Asleep at the Wheel]] and [[Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen]] plus the growing popularity of longtime Wills disciple and fan [[Willie Nelson]]. By 1971, Wills recovered sufficiently to travel occasionally and appear at tribute concerts. In 1973, he participated in a final reunion session with members of some of the Texas Playboys from the 1930s to the 1960s. Merle Haggard was invited to play at this reunion. The session, scheduled for two days, took place in December 1973, with the album to be titled ''For the Last Time''. Wills, speaking or attempting to holler, appeared on a couple tracks from the first day's session but suffered a stroke overnight. He had a more severe one a few days later. The musicians completed the album without him. Wills by then was comatose. He lingered until his death on May 13, 1975.\n\nReviewing ''For the Last Time'' in ''[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies]]'' (1981), [[Robert Christgau]] wrote: \"This double-LP doesn't represent the band at its peak.

Released as the B-side of a single that was a double-sided hit, it went to number one on the country charts. The song has become a staple of [[classic country]] radio station formats. In addition, [[The Rolling Stones]] performed this song live in Austin, Texas, at [[Zilker Park]] on their [[A Bigger Bang Tour]], a shout-out to Wills. This performance was included on their subsequent DVD ''[[The Biggest Bang]]''. In a 1968 issue of ''Guitar Player'', rock guitarist [[Jimi Hendrix]] said of Wills and the Playboys: \"I dig them. The Grand Ole Opry used to come on, and I used to watch that. They used to have some pretty heavy cats, some heavy guitar players.\" In fact, Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys only performed on the Opry twice: in 1944 and 1948. Hendrix almost surely referred to Nashville guitarists.\n\nWills ranked #27 in ''[[Country Music Television|CMT's]] 40 Greatest Men in Country Music'' in 2003.\n\nWills' upbeat 1938 song [[Ida Red]] was Chuck Berry's primary inspiration for creating his first rock-and-roll hit \"[[Maybellene]]\".\n\n[[Fats Domino]] once remarked that he patterned his 1960 rhythm section after that of Bob Wills.<ref>''San Antonio Rose: The Life and Music of Bob Wills''.
