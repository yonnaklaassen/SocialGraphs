They began performing together in the 1990s as part of two different bands with Montgomery's brother, [[John Michael Montgomery]]. Although Gentry won a talent contest in 1994, he reunited with Eddie Montgomery after Gentry was unable to find a solo record deal, and Montgomery Gentry was formed in 1999. The duo is known for its [[Southern rock]] influences, and has collaborated with [[Charlie Daniels]], [[Toby Keith]], [[Five for Fighting]], and members of [[The Allman Brothers Band]].\n\nMontgomery Gentry released six studio albums for [[Columbia Records]]' Nashville division: ''[[Tattoos & Scars]]'' (1999), ''[[Carrying On]]'' (2001), ''[[My Town (album)|My Town]]'' (2002), ''[[You Do Your Thing]]'' (2004), ''[[Some People Change]]'' (2006), and ''[[Back When I Knew It All]]'' (2008), and a Greatest Hits package. These albums produced more than twenty chart singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] chart, including the {{Abbr|No.|Number}} 1 hits, \"[[If You Ever Stop Loving Me]]\", \"[[Something to Be Proud Of]]\", \"[[Lucky Man (Montgomery Gentry song)|Lucky Man]]\", \"[[Back When I Knew It All (song)|Back When I Knew It All]]\", and \"[[Roll with Me]]\". Ten more of their songs reached the Top 10 on the country chart, including the {{Abbr|No.|Number}} 3 hit, \"[[Gone (Montgomery Gentry song)|Gone]]\", the most played country song by a duo in 2005. ''Tattoos & Scars'', ''My Town'', and ''You Do Your Thing'' are all [[music recording sales certification|certified platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]. In 1999, they were awarded Favorite New Artist—Country at the [[American Music Awards]]. Both the [[Academy of Country Music]] and [[Country Music Association]] named them Duo of the Year in 2000, awards for which they were nominated by one or both associations in every year until 2012. In 2009, they were inducted into the [[Grand Ole Opry]].\n\nOn September 8, 2017, Gentry died in [[2017 Medford, New Jersey helicopter crash|a helicopter crash]] in [[Medford, New Jersey|Medford]], New Jersey, where the duo was scheduled to perform that evening.
