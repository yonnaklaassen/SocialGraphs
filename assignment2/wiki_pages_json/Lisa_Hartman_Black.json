She recorded four solo albums between 1976 and 1987, with her most notable song being \"If Love Must Go\". She achieved significant success with a duet with her husband, Clint Black, called \"When I Said I Do\", which reached number one on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks charts in 1999. Hartman has appeared in various films and TV shows, including Flicka: Country Pride, Back to You and Me, and The Masked Singer. She married musician Clint Black in 1991, and the couple has a daughter, Lily Pearl Black. They have lived in Nashville, Tennessee, since 2002.\n\n==Career==\nAfter some minor television appearances, Hartman starred on the short-lived ''[[Bewitched]]'' spin-off, ''[[Tabitha (TV series)|Tabitha]]'' during 1977–78. She subsequently appeared frequently on television in guest roles, and appeared in the 1981 [[CBS]] TV remake of [[Jacqueline Susann]]'s ''[[Valley of the Dolls (novel)|Valley of the Dolls]]'', as [[Jacqueline Susann's Valley of the Dolls|Neely O'Hara]]. She was on [[WLS-TV]]'s 1979 special \"You're Never Too Old\" recorded at [[Six Flags Great America|Marriott's Great America]] in [[Gurnee, Illinois]].<ref>{{cite news |date=September 8, 1979 |title='You're Never Too Old' Premiere |page=77 |website=Chicago Tribune |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/79898366/youre-never-too-old-premiere/ |access-date=June 20, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=September 8, 1979 |title='You're Never Too Old' Premiere Advertisement |page=67 |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/79898319/youre-never-too-old-premiere-advertis/ |access-date=June 20, 2021}}</ref>\n\nHartman's breakthrough as an actress came in 1982 when she began appearing on the prime time drama ''[[Knots Landing]]'', playing rock singer Ciji Dunne. Her character engaged in romances with the characters played by [[Ted Shackelford]] and [[Michael Sabatino]]. Hartman was popular with audiences, and when Ciji was murdered off-screen in 1983, there was a public uproar. As a solution, Hartman was brought back on the show as [[Cathy Geary Rush|Cathy Geary]], also a singer, who later marries an unbalanced [[televangelist]] played by a young [[Alec Baldwin]]. Hartman remained with the show until 1986, when she was released due to budget cuts and because the show's writers felt there were no further storylines for her character. During her time on the series, she appeared in the film ''[[Where the Boys Are '84]]'' produced by [[Allan Carr]]. She also sang the film's theme song.\n\nHartman recorded four solo albums between 1976 and 1987 – two for [[Don Kirshner|Kirshner Records]], one for [[RCA Records]], and one for [[Atlantic Records]]. Her most notable song is \"If Love Must Go\", which she performed on various television shows like ''[[Solid Gold (TV series)|Solid Gold]]'' and ''[[The Merv Griffin Show]]''. Despite additional contributions from successful songwriters and producers including [[Jeff Barry]], [[Dobie Gray]], [[Bryan Adams]], [[Rick Springfield]], [[Will Jennings]], and [[Holly Knight]], the albums were not commercially successful. She achieved her most notable success with a duet with her husband entitled \"[[When I Said I Do]]\". It reached Number 1 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs|Hot Country Singles & Tracks]] charts on December 18, 1999, and was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]]. The duet was ranked No. 11 on ''[[Country Music Television|CMT]]'s 100 Greatest Duets in Country Music'' in 2005. They recorded a second duet titled \"Easy For Me to Say\", which peaked at No. 27 on the country music charts in 2002.\n\nIn the summer of 1994, Hartman co-hosted ''Universal Studios Summer Blast'', a TV special celebrating the 30th anniversary of [[Universal Studios]].\n\nIn April 2011, her albums ''Lisa Hartman'', ''Hold On'' and ''Letterock'' were released on CD with bonus tracks by [[Wounded Bird Records]] under license from [[Sony Music|Sony]]. Her last album, '''Til My Heart Stops'' was reissued on CD in 2008 on Wounded Bird Records as well.\n\nIn May 2012, Hartman starred in ''[[Flicka: Country Pride]]'', a movie from [[Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment]]. She plays the mother of a budding equestrian rider ([[Kacey Rohl]]).<ref>{{cite web|title=Lisa Hartman Black Interview on Family Film Flicka: Country Pride|date=April 25, 2012 |url=http://familyfocusblog.com/lisa-hartman-black-interview-on-family-film-flicka-country-pride | publisher=Family Focus Blog | access-date=April 25, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, Hartman starred in a made-for-TV film, ''Back to You and Me'', on the [[Hallmark Channel]].\n\nIn 2020, she and husband Clint Black appeared in [[The Masked Singer (American TV series) season 4|season four]] of ''[[The Masked Singer (American TV series)|The Masked Singer]]'' as \"Snow Owls\", notably competing as the series' first duet competitors while riding in an egg-shaped vehicle.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://ew.com/tv/the-masked-singer-snow-owls-clint-black-lisa-hartman-black-interview/|title=''The Masked Singer''{{'}}s Snow Owls might release a Snow Owlbum inspired by their time on the show|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|author=Lauren Huff|date=November 11, 2020|access-date=November 12, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nHartman grew up in Houston, Texas.
