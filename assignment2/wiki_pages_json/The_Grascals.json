Terry has played with such legends as [[Jimmy Martin]], [[Wilma Lee Cooper]], and the [[Osborne Brothers]]. Terry and his brother, Billy, recorded an album for [[Sony Music|CBS]] Records, which evolved to a number one video on [[CMT (U.S. TV channel)|CMT]] with \"Blues Stay Away From Me.\"  After touring with [[Grand Ole Opry]] member [[Mike Snider (musician)|Mike Snider]], Terry joined the Grascals and remains as a founding member.\n\n=== Danny Roberts ===\n\nDanny Roberts started playing guitar to back up Jimmy Mattingly when they were growing up in [[Leitchfield, Kentucky]].

The band recorded 10 CDs, made \"Seed of Love\" song, the first bluegrass video to feature the [[banjo]], and even reached number one on the [[The Nashville Network|TNN]] channel. That band broke up in 2000, but Danny still continued to play with others including [[Marty Raybon]], [[Larry Cordle]], and [[Melonie Cannon]]. He also joined Ronnie Reno's band, the Reno Tradition.

They played one of their first shows at the Station Inn in February 2004 with special guest [[Osborne Brothers|Bobby Osborne]]. The Grascals began recording their first album in 2004, which would simply be a self-titled album on [[Rounder Records]]. This album featured such songs as \"Me and John and Paul\" written by [[Harley Allen]], \"[[Where Corn Don't Grow]]\" and another popular cover song, \"Viva Las Vegas,\" which featured Dolly Parton.  During the recording, [[Dolly Parton]] showed interest in wanting to play with the Grascals.  The band soon became Dolly's opening act, as well as her bluegrass band.<ref name=\"bluegrasstoday.com\"/> Performing at [[Dollywood]] and the [[Grand Ole Opry]], the band and Dolly played a cover version of [[Elvis]]'s song, [[Viva Las Vegas (song)|\"Viva Las Vegas.\"]] The [[The grascals (album)|first album]] made it on to the Billboard charts, as well as many country and bluegrass charts.
