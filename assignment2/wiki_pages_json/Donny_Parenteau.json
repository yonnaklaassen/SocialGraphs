Parenteau wanted the chance to audition and would not let up until he got the chance to audition.  Parenteau listened to the group [[Jam session|jamming]] and had a grasp of what they were playing.  It was that song he would use as the audition piece.<ref name=calledbycountry/> During his time touring with McCoy, Parenteau got to open for such artists as [[Merle Haggard]],<ref name=calledbycountry/> [[Tim McGraw]],<ref name=calledbycountry/> [[Faith Hill]],<ref name=calledbycountry/> [[Buck Owens]],<ref name=calledbycountry/> [[George Jones]],<ref name=calledbycountry/> [[Charlie Pride]],<ref name=calledbycountry/> [[Loretta Lynn]],<ref name=calledbycountry/> [[Charlie Daniels]],<ref name=calledbycountry/> [[Hank Williams, Jr.]],<ref name=calledbycountry/> [[Reba McEntire]],<ref name=calledbycountry/> [[Garth Brooks]],<ref name=calledbycountry/> and [[Shania Twain]].<ref name=calledbycountry/> Parenteau also graced the [[Grand Ole Opry]] stage.<ref name=calledbycountry/> Parenteau was the only member of the live band that was also on the recordings.<ref name=calledbycountry/> After performing with Neal McCoy for 12 years and playing 250–300 shows a year, Parenteau returned to Prince Albert to embark on a solo career.<ref name=calledbycountry/>\n\n==Charity work==\nParenteau has done a number of humanitarian and charity work.  In 2001 SCMA International Humanitarian Award for his efforts.  He also appears on [[Telemiracle]] starting on the 32nd edition of the telethon.
