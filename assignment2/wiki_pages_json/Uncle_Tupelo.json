[[Jay Farrar]], [[Jeff Tweedy]], and [[Mike Heidorn]] formed the band after the lead singer of their previous band, The Primitives, left to attend college. The trio recorded three albums for Rockville Records, before signing with [[Sire Records]] and expanding to a five-piece. Shortly after the release of the band's major label debut album ''[[Anodyne (album)|Anodyne]]'', Farrar announced his decision to leave the band due to a soured relationship with his co-songwriter Tweedy. Uncle Tupelo split on May 1, 1994, after completing a farewell tour. Following the breakup, Farrar formed [[Son Volt]] with Heidorn, while the remaining members continued as [[Wilco]].\n\nAlthough Uncle Tupelo broke up before it achieved commercial success, the band is renowned for its impact on the alternative country music scene.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/explore/essay/|title=American Alternative Rock/Post-Punk|last=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas|author-link=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|access-date=May 31, 2006|website=[[AllMusic]]|archive-date=November 13, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101113053923/http://allmusic.com/explore/essay|url-status=dead}}</ref> The group's first album, ''[[No Depression (album)|No Depression]]'', became a byword for the genre and was widely influential. Uncle Tupelo's sound was unlike popular country music of the time, drawing inspiration from styles as diverse as the [[hardcore punk]] of [[The Minutemen (band)|The Minutemen]] and the country instrumentation and harmony of the [[Carter Family]] and [[Hank Williams]]. Farrar and Tweedy's lyrics frequently referred to [[Middle America (United States)|Middle America]] and the [[working class]] of Belleville.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== The Plebes and The Primitives ===\n[[Jay Farrar]], along with his brothers Wade and Dade, played in an early 1980s garage band named The Plebes.{{sfn|Kot|2004|p=10}} Hailing from [[Belleville, Illinois]], The Plebes sought to enter a battle-of-the-bands competition but needed another high school student as a member to perform. They invited [[Jeff Tweedy]], a high school friend of Jay Farrar, to join the band and play with them for the show.{{sfn|Kot|2004|p=17}} Despite a lack of skill with his instrument, Tweedy played an important role in the band by booking early gigs. While The Plebes had been playing music in a [[rockabilly]] style, Tweedy wanted to play [[punk rock]] like the music that he originally heard the group perform. This caused tensions between Tweedy and Dade Farrar, who left the band two months after Tweedy joined.{{sfn|Kot|2004|p=18}}\n\nBefore leaving the band in 1984, Dade Farrar introduced its members to [[Mike Heidorn]], the younger brother of his girlfriend; Heidorn then joined the group as their drummer.{{sfn|Kot|2004|p=18}}<ref name=\"liner\" /> The Plebes then decided to change its name to The Primitives, a reference to a 1965 song by psychedelic rock group The Groupies.{{sfn|Kot|2004|p=18}}<ref>The band was also known as \"The Primatives\" due to a misprint on their business cards</ref> Due to the unpopularity of punk rock in the [[St. Louis]] area, The Primitives began to play [[blues]]-oriented garage rock at fast tempos. They performed regularly at a wedding hall in [[Millstadt, Illinois]], where Tweedy's mother Jo Ann would collect the cover fee.<ref name=\"liner\" />{{sfn|Kot|2004|p=19}} They also performed regularly at B St Bar in Belleville with bands such as The Newsboys (later Sammy and the Snowmonkeys), Charlie Langrehr, and The Symptoms. Wade Farrar was the lead singer of the band, but his commitment to [[Southern Illinois University]] and an attempted enlistment in the [[United States Army]] meant he was only able to dedicate a small amount of time to the group. Additionally, Heidorn broke his collarbone during a concert in 1986, which caused the band to go on hiatus. Jay Farrar and Tweedy continued to write songs and perform at Heidorn's house while he recovered, and by 1987 they had restarted the group.{{sfn|Kot|2004|p=22}} The Primitives temporarily added Tony Mayr as a bassist so that Tweedy could play guitar, but a month later the band decided to keep Tweedy on bass and remain a three-piece.<ref name=\"liner\" /> To avoid confusion with a successful British band also named [[The Primitives]], they decided to change their name once again, to Uncle Tupelo.<ref name=\"PopM\" /> Although they performed only 1960s cover songs as The Primitives, the trio decided to take a new approach and write their own music under their new name.<ref name=\"PD\" />\n\n=== As Uncle Tupelo ===\n[[File:Uncle Tupelo poster.png|thumb|left|An early poster for an Uncle Tupelo show, in the style of Chuck Wagner's original drawing]]\nThe Primitives renamed themselves Uncle Tupelo, a name  created by combining two randomly chosen words from the dictionary. Inspired by the name, cartoonist Chuck Wagner, a friend of the band, created a character resembling an old, fat [[Elvis Presley]].<ref name=\"liner\" />{{sfn|Kot|2004|p=23}} The trio recorded a four-song demo tape, which got them supporting slots opening for headline artists such as [[Johnny Thunders]] and [[Warren Zevon]].<ref name=\"liner\" /> Tweedy met Tony Margherita while working as a clerk at Euclid Records in St. Louis. After attending two of the band's shows, Margherita offered to become their manager.{{sfn|Kot|2004|pp=25–26}} Uncle Tupelo began to play regular shows at Cicero's Basement — a bar close to the campus of [[Washington University in St. Louis]]. Bands playing in a similar style, including [[Brian Henneman]]'s group Chicken Truck, often played at the venue, which by late 1988 was considered the locus of a new music scene.{{sfn|Kot|2004|pp=29–30}} The band temporarily expanded to a four-piece with the addition of the guitarist Alex Mutrux, but soon reverted to a trio.<ref name=\"liner\" />\n\nUncle Tupelo recorded demo tracks in the attic studio of future Chicago punk producer Matt Allison in [[Champaign, Illinois]]. The demo, distributed with the title ''Not Forever, Just for Now'', includes \"I Got Drunk\" and \"Screen Door\", as well as early versions of several other songs that would appear on the band's first studio album.{{sfn|Kot|2004|p=38}} The ''[[College Media Journal|CMJ New Music Report]]'' gave the tape a rave review, and called Uncle Tupelo the best unsigned band of the year. The accolade drew the attention of independent labels, and the band decided to sign with Jay Fialkov and Debbie Southwood-Smith of [[Giant Records (independent label)|Giant Records]], who offered to book them at [[CBGB]] in New York City.<ref>{{cite news|last=Pick|first=Steve|title=Uncle Tupelo: From Belleville to Rockville|newspaper=St. Louis Post-Dispatch|date=July 5, 1990}}</ref> Explaining the decision, the band said that \"[our] original goals don't get distorted with an independent label.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Toroian|first=Diane|url=http://www.factorybelt.net/articles/giant.jpg|title=Uncle Tupelo Taking Giant Step|work=[[St. Louis Sun|The Sun]]|date=November 1989}} Last accessed June 8, 2007.</ref>\n\n=== Recordings on Rockville Records ===\n{{Listen|filename=UTFactoryBelt.ogg|title=\"Factory Belt\"|description=The fifth track on ''No Depression'', sung by Jay Farrar.

Originally a [[Louvin Brothers]] song, [[Peter Buck]] approached the band after hearing Uncle Tupelo's version of this song performed live. It is an exemplar of the acoustic recordings found on ''March''.}}\nShortly after Uncle Tupelo's signing, Giant Records changed its name to Rockville Records. The band's first album for Rockville, ''[[No Depression (album)|No Depression]]'', was recorded over ten days in January 1990, at Fort Apache South recording studio in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]. The album's thematic structure revolved around their lives as adolescents in Belleville; examples are songs about wanting to avoid factory work and songs about fearing a potential [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]] [[military draft]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Blackstock|first=Peter|title=Uncle Tupelo Offers Varying Takes on Small-town Life|work=[[Austin American-Statesman]]|date=January 23, 1991}}</ref> Impressed by their previous work on [[Dinosaur Jr.]]'s ''[[Bug (Dinosaur Jr album)|Bug]]'', the band wanted [[Paul Kolderie]] and [[Sean Slade]] to produce the album. Slade let Farrar play on the same 1961 [[Gibson Les Paul Junior|Gibson Les Paul SG Junior]] that [[J. Mascis]] originally played on ''Bug''.{{sfn|Kot|2004|pp=41–44}} The album was released on June 21, 1990, and the band celebrated by playing at Cicero's for two nights.\n\nIn between tours, Farrar, Tweedy and Heidorn formed a country cover band named Coffee Creek, along with Brian Henneman (later a member of [[The Bottle Rockets]]). Henneman impressed Uncle Tupelo, and he was invited to be a guitar technician and occasional multi-instrumentalist for the band.{{sfn|Kot|2004|pp=48–49}} While Farrar and Heidorn would avoid drinking too much after shows, Tweedy would continue drinking throughout the night. Although Tweedy stopped after he began dating Sue Miller in 1991, a significant communication gap had already been opened between Tweedy and Farrar.{{sfn|Kot|2004|pp=51–53}}\n\nBy March 1991, ''No Depression'' had sold an estimated 15,000 copies, and was featured in a ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' article about rising stars.<ref name=\"liner\" />{{sfn|Kot|2004|p=52}} However, Rockville Records refused to pay the band any royalties for the album, a theme that would continue for the remainder of the band's contract.{{sfn|Kot|2004|p=52}} Over seventeen days the band recorded a second album at [[Long View Farm]] in rural [[North Brookfield, Massachusetts]]. ''[[Still Feel Gone]]'', with a more layered sound, was also produced by Kolderie and Slade, with contributions by Slade, Henneman, Rich Gilbert, Chris Bess of Enormous Richard, and [[Gary Louris]] of [[The Jayhawks]]. The band was disappointed with the production of the album and decided to discontinue working with Kolderie and Slade.{{sfn|Kot|2004|p=58}} Soon afterward, Uncle Tupelo recorded \"Shaking Hands (Soldier's Joy)\" on [[Michelle Shocked]]'s album ''[[Arkansas Traveler (Michelle Shocked album)|Arkansas Traveler]]'' and joined her on the accompanying tour with [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]] and [[The Band]]. However, the tour only lasted for a few shows because of managerial problems between Shocked and The Band.<ref name=\"last\" /><ref>{{cite news|last=Morse|first=Steve|title=Shocked's Show Goes on, Despite Disputes|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=October 8, 1992}}</ref><ref name=\"CST\" />\n\n[[Alternative rock]] had broken into the mainstream by 1992, and an album released in that style was expected to earn the group a major-label record deal. However, Uncle Tupelo did not want to follow in the footsteps of groups such as [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], and decided to play [[country music|country]] and [[folk song]]s \"as a big 'fuck you' to the rock scene\".{{sfn|Kot|2004|pp=59–60}}{{sfn|Kot|2004|p=66}} [[Peter Buck]], guitarist for [[R.E.M.]], saw the trio perform at the [[40 Watt Club]] in [[Athens, Georgia]] and sought them out after the show. Buck was impressed with a version of \"Atomic Power\" that the band played, and offered his services for their next album. Over a span of five days, Buck produced the group's next album, ''[[March 16–20, 1992]]''.{{sfn|Kot|2004|p=61}} Buck allowed them to stay in his house during the sessions, and charged no money for his services. Henneman's role was increased for this album, and he taught himself how to play [[mandolin]] and [[bouzouki]].{{sfn|Kot|2004|p=63}} Despite turning away from the style of popular alternative rock, major labels began to show significant interest in Uncle Tupelo after ''March 16–20, 1992'' was released.{{sfn|Kot|2004|p=66}} The album sold more than their two previous recordings combined, although Rockville was displeased that it did not conform to the style of popular alternative rock.<ref>{{cite news|last=Eichenberger|first=Bill|title=Life's All Right; Uncle Tupelo Kicks Back, Adds Acoustic Touch and Sings Great Songs|work=[[Columbus Dispatch]]|date=March 1, 1994}}</ref>\n\n=== Major label contract ===\nIn 1992, Joe McEwen of [[Sire Records]] began to pursue the band. McEwen, who brought notable acts such as Dinosaur Jr. and [[Shawn Colvin]] to Sire, had been interested in them since hearing the ''Not Forever, Just for Now'' demo tape. At the urging of [[Gary Louris]], McEwen offered Uncle Tupelo a contract. Band manager Tony Margherita invoked the $50,000 escape clause he had put in their Rockville contract, freeing the band to sign a seven-year deal with Sire. The deal required two albums and specified a budget of $150,000 for the first.{{sfn|Kot|2004|pp=71–73}}\n\nAround the time of the recording of ''March 16–20, 1992'', Mike Heidorn had secured a steady job at a Belleville newspaper company and was dating a woman who had two children from a previous marriage. Uncle Tupelo had planned a tour of Europe, but Heidorn wanted to stay in Belleville with his girlfriend, whom he married in August 1992.<ref name=\"CST\" />{{sfn|Kot|2004|p=69}}\n\nThe band held auditions prior to the promotional tour for ''March 16–20, 1992'', and two candidates stood out: Bill Belzer and [[Ken Coomer]]. Although Farrar and Tweedy agreed that Coomer was the better drummer, they were intimidated by his six-foot-four stature and long [[dreadlocks]]. The band instead selected Belzer as Heidorn's replacement, but he only stayed with the band for six months.{{sfn|Kot|2004|p=73}} Tweedy explained Belzer's departure:{{sfn|Kot|2004|p=74}}\n\n<blockquote>I want to believe it was purely musical, and I honestly believe that it wasn't working musically. I also believe that we weren't emotionally mature enough to be close friends with a [[gay]] person at that point in our lives&nbsp;... And Bill was and is a very proud and righteous gay person, very open about his homosexuality.</blockquote>\n\nAfter touring Europe opening for [[Sugar (American band)|Sugar]], the band replaced Belzer with Coomer. The band also experimented with new members: [[John Stirratt]] replaced Brian Henneman (who left to form The Bottle Rockets) while [[Max Johnston (musician)|Max Johnston]], the brother of Michelle Shocked, joined as a live mandolin and [[violin]] performer. Stirratt became the full-time bassist, allowing Tweedy to perform more songs with the guitar.{{sfn|Kot|2004|p=75}}\n\nNow a five-piece, Uncle Tupelo recorded their major label debut at Cedar Creek studio in [[Austin, Texas]] in early 1993. ''[[Anodyne (album)|Anodyne]]'' consisted of live-in-the-studio recordings and included a duet with Farrar and [[Doug Sahm]] of the [[Sir Douglas Quintet]].{{sfn|Kot|2004|p=78}} The album sold 150,000 copies, and was their only entry on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Top Heatseekers|Heatseekers]] chart.{{sfn|Kot|2004|pp=79–80}}<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Heatseekers|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=October 10, 1993}}</ref> The group toured until the end of the year, finishing with a sold-out concert at Tramps in New York City. Because of their concert draw, major executives at Sire began to see the band as a potential hit.{{sfn|Kot|2004|pp=79–80}}\n\nIn 1993, the band contributed a cover of [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]]'s track \"Effigy\" to the AIDS-Benefit album ''[[No Alternative]]'' produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]].\n\n=== Breakup ===\nWith the addition of Stirratt, Coomer, and Johnston just prior to the recording of ''Anodyne'', Farrar and Tweedy's relationship became more tumultuous, leading to verbal altercations after concerts. In one account, Tweedy recalled:{{sfn|Kot|2004|p=77}}\n\n<blockquote>Around this time, I would say something into a microphone onstage, and afterward [Farrar would] pull me aside and say, \"Don't you ever fucking talk into that microphone again.\" He would misconstrue me talking into the microphone as more evidence of my out-of-control, rampant ego, more evidence of me feeling like I didn't have to be so fucking afraid anymore.</blockquote>\n\nTweedy felt the new members gave him a new opportunity to contribute to the band, but Farrar felt disdain for Tweedy's new carefree attitude. Years later, Farrar would claim that he had been tempted to quit the band after seeing Tweedy stroking the hair of Farrar's girlfriend, an act which he believed to have been a proposition.<ref>{{cite web|last=Llewellyn|first=Kati|url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/35152-jay-farrar-speaks-extensively-about-uncle-tupelos-breakup |title=Jay Farrar Speaks Extensively About Uncle Tupelo's Breakup|publisher=[[Pitchfork Media]]|date=September 8, 2005 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080308083824/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/35152-jay-farrar-speaks-extensively-about-uncle-tupelos-breakup |archive-date = March 8, 2008}} Last accessed June 8, 2007.</ref> In January 1994, Farrar called manager Tony Margherita to inform him of his decision to leave the band. Farrar told Margherita that he was no longer having fun, and did not want to work with Tweedy anymore.{{sfn|Kot|2004|pp=81–82}} Soon after the breakup, Farrar explained his departure: \"It just seemed like it reached a point where Jeff and I really weren't compatible.

The following day, the two engaged in a verbal confrontation.{{sfn|Kot|2004|pp=82–83}} As a favor to Margherita, who had spent a substantial amount of money to keep the band running, Farrar agreed to a final tour with Uncle Tupelo in North America. Tweedy and Farrar again engaged in a shouting match two weeks into the tour, due to Farrar's refusal to sing harmony on any of Tweedy's songs.{{sfn|Kot|2004|pp=82–83}} The band made its first appearance on national television during the tour when they were featured on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]''. Sire had requested that the band perform \"The Long Cut\" on the show, which further irked Farrar since the song was written and sung by Tweedy.\n\nUncle Tupelo's last concerts, two shows at [[The Blue Note (Columbia, Missouri)|The Blue Note]] in [[Columbia, Missouri]] and two shows at [[Mississippi Nights]] in [[St. Louis]], took place from April 28 to May 1, 1994. A special \"last leg\" poster was created for the occasion which facetiously promoted the band as \"St. Louis's 4th best country band\", based on a readers' poll in the [[Riverfront Times]]. On the last night, Tweedy and Farrar each performed nine songs during the concert, and Mike Heidorn performed as drummer during the encore.{{sfn|Kot|2004|p=84−85}}\n\n=== Post-breakup ===\n{{further|Son Volt|Wilco}}\nFollowing Uncle Tupelo's final tour, Tweedy encouraged his bandmates to join him in a new group, while Farrar searched for members for a band of his own. Tweedy was able to retain the rest of the Uncle Tupelo lineup, and created [[Wilco]]. They began rehearsing a few days after the final Uncle Tupelo concert, and by August 1994 they were in the recording studio for their first album, ''[[A.M. (Wilco album)|A.M.]]''. Farrar asked Jim Boquist to join his new band, [[Son Volt]]; Boquist was a multi-instrumentalist who had performed with [[Joe Henry]] as the opening act on Uncle Tupelo's last tour. Boquist also recruited his brother Dave, and Farrar convinced Mike Heidorn to leave Belleville to join the group. Farrar's new four-piece began recording their debut album ''[[Trace (Son Volt album)|Trace]]'' in November 1994.{{sfn|Kot|2004|pp=89–90}}\n\nWilco signed to [[Reprise Records]] while Son Volt signed with [[Warner Bros.

Son Volt had an early [[college rock]] hit with \"Drown\" from the album ''Trace'', but Wilco maintained a more commercially successful career in the years to follow.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks|magazine=Billboard|date=April 13, 1996}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|last=Cohen|first=Jonathan|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1052800/wilco-in-the-comfort-zone|title=Wilco: In the Comfort Zone|magazine=Billboard|date=April 13, 2007|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070622183009/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1052800/wilco-in-the-comfort-zone |archive-date = June 22, 2007|url-status=dead}} Last accessed June 8, 2007.</ref> Regarding the possibility of a reunion, Mike Heidorn reported in a PopMatters interview that \"nothing's ever for sure, but I would have to say, 'No such thing'.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Dechert|first=S.

After securing the rights, the band released a compilation entitled ''[[89/93: An Anthology]]''. In 2003, Uncle Tupelo re-issued their first three albums, which before the lawsuit had cumulatively sold over 200,000 copies.{{sfn|Kot|2004|p=72}}\n\n== Influences ==\nAs The Primitives, Tweedy and Farrar were highly influenced by punk bands such as [[The Ramones]] and [[The Sex Pistols]]. However, they began to listen to country music because punk rock was not well received in the Belleville and St. Louis music scenes. While they originally were introduced to country by their parents, it was not until this time that they began to listen to it for leisure.{{sfn|Kot|2004|p=19}}<ref name=\"NYT\" /> Farrar typically wrote songs about [[Middle America (US)|Middle America]], while Tweedy wrote about more mainstream topics such as relationships.

We have two main styles that have been influences. For instance, we like [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]] as much as early Bob Dylan and Dinosaur Jr. as much as [[Hank Williams]]... To us, hard-core punk is also folk music. We draw a close parallel between the two. We'll play both in the same set if we get a chance.
