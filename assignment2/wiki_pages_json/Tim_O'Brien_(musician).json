In addition to singing, he plays guitar, [[fiddle]], [[mandolin]], [[banjo]], [[bouzouki]] and [[mandocello]]. He has released more than ten studio albums, in addition to charting a duet with [[Kathy Mattea]] entitled \"The Battle Hymn of Love\", a No.&nbsp;9 hit on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now [[Hot Country Songs]]) charts in 1990. In November 2013 he was inducted into the West Virginia Music Hall of Fame.\n\n== Early life ==\nTim O'Brien was born on March 16, 1954, and raised in [[Wheeling, West Virginia]], the youngest in a family of five children. At the age of 12, he first heard a [[Bob Dylan]] record, played by his older sister [[Mollie O'Brien|Mollie]], afterwards deciding to take up music.  Throughout his teens, he taught himself to play guitar, [[fiddle|violin]], and [[mandolin]].\n\nIn high school, he and his sister Mollie, a singer, began performing [[Peter, Paul, and Mary]] songs as a duo at church and local coffeehouses.<ref name=\"bio\"/>\n\n== Music career ==\n\n=== Hot Rize ===\n[[File:Hot Rize-by Eric Frommer.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Hot Rize in 2004: [[Pete Wernick]], [[eTown|Nick Forster]], Tim O'Brien, [[Bryan Sutton]]]]\nIn 1973, he dropped out of [[Colby College]] to pursue music professionally.  He wrote to his mother at the time, saying, \"I'm heading west.  I know 200 songs now, and I figure if I keep learning more I should be all right.\"\n\nHe eventually moved to [[Boulder, Colorado]], in the 1970s and became part of the music scene there. He played bars around Denver and Boulder with Dan Sadowsky and the Ophelia Swing Band and cut one of his earliest albums, Swing Tunes of the 30's and 40's, with that band in 1977.  In [[Colorado]], he met guitarist/bassist [[Charles Sawtelle]], banjoist [[Pete Wernick]], and guitarist Mike Scap, with whom he formed [[Hot Rize]] in 1978. Mike Scap was soon replaced by Nick Forster on bass with Sawtelle moving to guitar. Over the next twelve years, the quartet earned recognition as one of America's most innovative and entertaining bluegrass bands. Never straying too far from a traditional sound, Hot Rize stood out with fresh harmony singing, Wernick's melodic banjo playing, and O'Brien's easy-going rhythmic drive.\n\nTo broaden their repertoire, the members of Hot Rize would often split their show with a set of classic and offbeat country and western music in the comic guise of Red Knuckles and the Trailblazers.<ref name=\"Official Website\">{{cite web |url=http://www.timobrien.net/bio.cfm |title=Tim O'Brien - Welcome |access-date=February 27, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080313073415/http://www.timobrien.net/bio.cfm |archive-date=March 13, 2008 }} Official Website</ref> The band would walk off stage, change clothes, and reappear as a different band (O'Brien assumed the role of \"Red Knuckles\"), with its own songs, fictional back story and humorous costumes. Hot Rize was the International Bluegrass Music Association's first Entertainer of the Year in 1990, and in 1993, O'Brien took the IBMA's Male Vocalist of the Year honors.\n\nIn 1990, Hot Rize disbanded as a regular touring and recording band.  However, after the death of guitarist Charles Sawtelle, in 2002 Hot Rize was joined by award winning guitarist Bryan Sutton and the band began to once again play limited engagements.\n\n=== Duets with Mollie O'Brien ===\n{{Listen\n|filename=OrphanGirl.ogg\n|title=\"Orphan Girl\"\n|description=Sample of \"Orphan Girl\" off ''Away Out on the Mountain'' with Tim and Mollie O'Brien (1994)\n|format=[[Ogg]]}}In 1984, O'Brien and his sister [[Mollie O'Brien]] reunited for a Mother's Day concert, and four years later recorded the duet album ''Take Me Back''.<ref name=\"all\"/> Chip Renner of [[AllMusic]] gave the album 4.5/5 stars, and called it \"a masterpiece.\"<ref name=\"renner\"/> In 1986 they began performing again as an Americana duo, and produced two more albums, ''Remember Me'' (1992), and ''Away Out on the Mountain'' (1994). All three records were released on [[Sugar Hill Records (bluegrass label)|Sugar Hill Records]].<ref name=\"fame\"/>\n\n=== Solo career ===\nO'Brien, who had already recorded several albums without Hot Rize, embarked on a solo career.  He briefly signed to [[RCA Records]], recording an album with them called \"Odd Man In\", before being dropped. [[Sugar Hill Records (bluegrass label)|Sugar Hill Records]] eventually released the album, and O'Brien has not signed to a major since. In 1990, O'Brien also charted along with [[Kathy Mattea]] on the duet \"The Battle Hymn of Love\", which peaked at No.&nbsp;9 on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Singles & Tracks]] charts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/|title=Billboard – Music Charts, News, Photos & Video|website=Billboard.com}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, O'Brien featured prominently on [[Kris Drever]]'s second solo album, ''Mark the Hard Earth''.  He also produced at least one instructional video/DVD of mandolin and bouzouki instruments.\n\nO'Brien joined Mark Knopfler in his Get Lucky Tour between April 8, 2010 and July 31, 2010.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.markknopflersworld.com/get-lucky-tour.html | title=Get Lucky Tour - Mark Knopfler's World }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdKEZWTCfQM | title=Working for Mark Knopfler | website=[[YouTube]] }}</ref>\n\n=== Howdy Skies Records ===\nO'Brien started his own record label, [[Howdy Skies Records]], in 1999.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://timobrien.net/bio |website=Timobrien.net|title=Bio : Tim O'Brien Band (short version) |date=2019| access-date=November 15, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Style and sound ==\n{{blockquote|I wanted to do the whole spectrum of folk music from one guy singing and playing guitar or fiddle to a full band with electric guitar,\" O'Brien said. And that's how the pair (of albums) came out, like folk music bookends. Fiddler's Green tends toward the intimate and traditional, while Cornbread Nation is a bit funkier and tempo-driven. On both, however, old-time tunes sit comfortably next to originals and a few classic country songs by the likes of Jimmie Rodgers and Harlan Howard. I could have taken all traditional songs, but I love stuff like \"California Blues\" and \"Busted,\" which are like folk songs to me, and they fit with the others, and it shows that what is called country music is just another footstep down the same path. Rock and roll, a lot of that is the same too.<ref name=\"Official Website\"/>}}\n\nAlthough naturally left-handed, O'Brien plays the guitar and other instruments right-handed.\n\n== Distinctions and awards ==\n*In 2014, O'Brien won a Grammy Award for Best Bluegrass Album for \"The Earls of Leicester\"\n* 2013 Inducted into the West Virginia Music Hall Of Fame<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wvmusichalloffame.com/TOBrien.html |title=Tim O'Brien |website=www.wvmusichalloffame.com |access-date=13 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150111055853/http://www.wvmusichalloffame.com/TOBrien.html |archive-date=11 January 2015 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n*In 2005, O'Brien won a [[Grammy Award for Best Traditional Folk Album]] for ''Fiddler's Green''.\n*In 1993 and 2006, O'Brien was honored with the [[International Bluegrass Music Awards|International Bluegrass Music Award]] (IBMA) for Male Vocalist of the Year.<ref>[http://ibmaawards.org/node/42 RECIPIENT HISTORY – IBMA AWARDS] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130225135634/http://ibmaawards.org/node/42 |date=February 25, 2013 }} International Bluegrass Music Association official webpage.</ref>\n*His band [[Hot Rize]] was the IBMA's first Entertainer of the Year in 1990.\n\n==Discography==\n{{Main| Tim O'Brien discography}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist| refs =\n<ref name=\"bio\">{{cite news\n |title       = About Mollie O'Brien and Rich Moore\n |url         = http://www.mollieobrien.com/about-mollie/109-about-mollie-and-rich.html\n |publisher   = MollieO'Brien.com\n |access-date  = February 25, 2012\n|url-status     = dead\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110813210500/http://www.mollieobrien.com/about-mollie/109-about-mollie-and-rich.html\n |archive-date = August 13, 2011\n}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"all\">{{cite news\n| title       = Biography\n| first       = Jason\n| last        = Ankeny\n| url         = http://www.allmusic.com/artist/mollie-obrien-p110492/biography\n| publisher   = [[AllMusic]]\n| access-date  = February 25, 2012\n}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"renner\">{{cite news\n| title       = ''Take Me Back'' – Review\n| first       = Chip\n| last        = Renner\n| url         = http://www.allmusic.com/album/take-me-back-r96813\n| publisher   = [[AllMusic]]\n| access-date  = February 25, 2012\n}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"fame\">{{cite news\n| title       = FAME Review: Mollie O'Brien – Big Red Sun\n| first       = Allen\n| last        = Price\n| url         = http://www.acousticmusic.com/fame/p00960.htm\n| publisher   = Peterborough Folk Music Society\n| year        = 1999\n| access-date  = February 25, 2012\n}}</ref>\n\n}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{Cite web|url=https://timobrien.net/short-order-sessions|title=Short Order Sessions &#124; Tim O'Brien|website=Timobrien.net}}\n*{{official website|http://www.timobrien.net}}\n*{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p110501|label=Tim O'Brien}}\n*{{MusicBrainz artist|id=3bece26d-86b1-4534-a205-6e6182264eb6|name=Tim O'Brien}}\n{{West Virginia Music Hall of Fame}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Obrien, Tim}}\n[[Category:1954 births]]\n[[Category:American bluegrass musicians]]\n[[Category:American country guitarists]]\n[[Category:American male guitarists]]\n[[Category:American country singer-songwriters]]\n[[Category:American fiddlers]]\n[[Category:American folk musicians]]\n[[Category:Grammy Award winners]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Musicians from Wheeling, West Virginia]]\n[[Category:American bluegrass mandolinists]]\n[[Category:Guitarists from West Virginia]]\n[[Category:20th-century American guitarists]]\n[[Category:21st-century American violinists]]\n[[Category:20th-century American male musicians]]\n[[Category:21st-century American male musicians]]\n[[Category:Psychograss members]]\n[[Category:Hot Rize members]]\n[[Category:Sugar Hill Records artists]]\n[[Category:RCA Records artists]]\n[[Category:Colby College alumni]]\n[[Category:The Earls of Leicester (band) members]]\n[[Category:Singer-songwriters from West Virginia]]"
