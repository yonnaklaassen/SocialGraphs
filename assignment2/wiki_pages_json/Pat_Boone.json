He had appeared with his daughter Debby in a commercial to claim that all four of his daughters had found a preparation named Acne-Statin a \"real help\" in keeping their skin clear. The FTC filed a complaint against the manufacturer, contending that the product did not really keep skin free of blemishes. Boone eventually signed a consent order in which he promised not only to stop appearing in the ads, but also to pay about 2.5% of any money that the FTC or the courts might eventually order the manufacturer to refund to consumers.

Boone's third film for Fox was an \"A\" production, ''[[Goodbye Charlie]]'' (1964), but Boone was in support of [[Debbie Reynolds]] and [[Tony Curtis]].
