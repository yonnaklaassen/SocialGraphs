The group's members were Ron Hemby (lead vocals, guitar), John Dittrich (vocals, drums), and Charlie Kelley (vocals, guitar). Hemby was a vocalist in the Christian group [[the Imperials]], Kelley played guitar for [[Doug Stone]], and Dittrich had left his role as the drummer in the band [[Restless Heart]]. The Buffalo Club released a self-titled album on the [[Rising Tide Records]] label in 1997 and charted three singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts that year, including \"[[If She Don't Love You]]\" at number nine. The album received generally positive reviews for the band's use of vocal harmony. After Dittrich quit in August 1997, Hemby and Kelley briefly continued as a duo before disbanding by year's end. Dittrich rejoined Restless Heart in 1998, while Kelley and Hemby started other projects.\n\n==History==\n===Foundation===\nThe Buffalo Club was founded in 1996 in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], by John Dittrich, best known as the drummer for the [[country music]] band [[Restless Heart]], along with Ron Hemby and Charlie Kelley.<ref name=\"whitburn\"/> After Restless Heart disbanded in 1995,<ref name=\"restless heart allmusic\">{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/restless-heart-mn0000393789/biography |author=Steve Huey| title=Restless Heart biography | website=[[AllMusic]] | accessdate=April 30, 2022 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20230814184836/https://www.allmusic.com/artist/restless-heart-mn0000393789/biography |archive-date=August 14, 2023 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"fact\"/> Dittrich wanted to start a musical act in which he got to exercise more creative control than he had in that band, but did not feel he was suitable as a solo artist.<ref name=\"fact\"/> He then met Hemby, a vocalist for the [[contemporary Christian music]] group [[The Imperials]], and the two recruited Kelley, who had previously been a backing musician for [[Charly McClain]] and [[Doug Stone]]. Hemby assumed the role of lead vocalist. Both Kelley and Dittrich served as harmony vocalists, also contributing on guitar and drums respectively.<ref name=\"corral\">{{cite magazine | url=https://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-All-Music/Billboard/90s/1997/Billboard-1997-02-01.pdf | title=Rising Tide Corrals Support For Buffalo Club's Debut | author=Deborah Evans Price | magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] | pages=31, 36 | date=February 1, 1997 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20230814185305/https://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-All-Music/Billboard/90s/1997/Billboard-1997-02-01.pdf |archive-date=August 14, 2023 |url-status=live}}</ref> Working with Dan Goodman as their manager, the three musicians recorded a [[Demo (music)|demo]] which was sent to Ken Levitan, then president of [[Rising Tide Records]].

Kelley thought that the band's sound would be appealing to radio as they intended to use fewer instruments on the songs than were normal at the time.<ref name=\"corral\"/> Hemby thought that the band's sound would have \"more aggressive harmony\".<ref name=\"fact\"/>\n\nInitially, the group was to be called Johnny Ringo, but was renamed as representatives of Rising Tide disliked the original name.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> According to Hemby, the band wanted a name with a [[Western (genre)|Western]] theme, and came up with \"the Buffalo Club\" after a friend of his told him about a group of [[bar (establishment)|bars]] in the town of [[Buffalo, Wyoming]].<ref name=\"corral\"/><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-index-journal/130007673/ | title=Country music memo | work=The Index Journal | date=May 11, 1997 | accessdate=April 30, 2022 | pages=3C}}</ref> After signing, the band began recording songs with producer [[Barry Beckett]]. Dittrich had previously worked with Beckett on a movie soundtrack to which Restless Heart had contributed, and chose him to be the Buffalo Club's producer because he \"admired\" Beckett's production style. Additionally, Hemby noted that Beckett was less controlling than other producers with whom he had worked previously.<ref name=\"fact\"/> By the end of 1996, the band began promoting themselves with impromptu acoustic performances in the offices of Nashville record executives.<ref name=\"corral\"/>\n\n===Self-titled album===\nRising Tide Records selected \"[[If She Don't Love You]]\" as the band's first single.
