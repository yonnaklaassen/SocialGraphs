In 1991, she signed to [[BNA Records]] (then known as BNA Entertainment), releasing her self-titled debut album that year. This album produced two singles for her on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] chart. Stewart is a BMI Award winning songwriter and has  appeared in films alongside Oscar winners Gwynneth Paltrow and Melissa Leo. She currently tours with her jazz combo.\n\n==Life and career==\nStewart was born August 6, 1968, in [[Louisville, Mississippi]].<ref name=\"miss\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mswritersandmusicians.com/musicians/lisa-stewart.html |title=Lisa Stewart, Mississippi country singer |accessdate=July 25, 2008 |last=Glass |first=Paul |work=Mississippi Writers and Musicians}}</ref> She first sang in public at age six in her church. Five years later, she attended a Tent Show at the Nashville Fan Fair, where she gave her first country performance. By 1987, Stewart had moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], where she won the Roy Acuff scholarship at Belmont University and found work as a studio singer.\n\nWhile performing at a wedding reception in 1991, Stewart was noticed by Mark Thompson, [[Wynonna Judd]]'s bandleader, who asked Stewart to sing demos for him. After recording the demos, Stewart signed to a recording contract with BNA Entertainment (now known as [[BNA Records]]), releasing her debut single \"Somebody's in Love\" in late 1992. This song was the first of three singles from her self-titled debut album — which was released in January 1993 — followed by \"Under the Light of the Texaco\" and \"Drive Time\". Also included on the album was a cover of [[Jeannie Seely]]'s 1966 single \"Don't Touch Me\".\n\nIn addition to promoting her album on radio tours, Stewart hosted the nationally syndicated entertainment news show ''#1 Country''. She also made appearances on [[The Nashville Network]], hosting their programs ''Yesteryear'' and ''This Week in Country Music'' and was a featured performer on \"Music City Tonight\". \n\nIn 1994, she recorded her second album for BNA. Produced by [[Barry Beckett]], the album was entitled <i>Solitary Heart</i>, and the first single was set to be \"[[Let's Go to Vegas]]\" (later a Top 5 hit for [[Faith Hill]]), but after a shakeup at the label, Stewart was dropped and the album was shelved. \n\nFrom 1997-1999, she co-hosted <i>This Week in Country Music</i> with Steve Phillips on TNN. She also continued to tour throughout the late 1990s.\n\nStewart began acting in the 21st century under her married name of Lisa Stewart Seals,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theboot.com/lisa-stewart-seals-movie/ |title=Lisa Stewart Seals Scores Role in Tim McGraw Movie |website=Theboot.com |date= 8 February 2010|accessdate=2020-04-04}}</ref> but is currently known as Lisa Stewart.\n\nShe is now making a mark in the jazz world and performs with her combo, often featuring Chester Thompson on drums (Genesis, Weather Report, Frank Zappa and The Mothers of Invention).\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:12em;\"| Title\n! style=\"width:20em;\"| Album details\n|- \n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[Lisa Stewart (album)|Lisa Stewart]]''\n| \n* Release date: January 1993\n* Label: [[BNA Records]]\n* Format: CD, [[audio cassette|cassette]]\n|}\n\n===Singles===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Year\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:16em;\"| Single\n! colspan=\"2\"| Peak chart<br />positions\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n! style=\"width:45px;\"| [[Hot Country Songs|US Country]]\n! style=\"width:45px;\"| [[RPM (magazine)|CAN Country]]\n|-\n| 1992\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Somebody's in Love\"\n| 61\n| —\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 1993\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Under the Light of the Texaco\"<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Billboard/90s/1993/BB-1993-06-19.pdf|title=Single Reviews|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=June 19, 1993}}</ref>\n| —\n| —\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Drive Time\"\n| 72\n| 60\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" style=\"font-size:8pt\"| \"—\" denotes releases that did not chart\n|}\n\n===Music videos===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!
