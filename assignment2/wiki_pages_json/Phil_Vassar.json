Vassar made his debut on the country music scene in the late 1990s, co-writing singles for several country artists, including [[Tim McGraw]] (\"[[For a Little While]]\", \"[[My Next Thirty Years]]\"), [[Jo Dee Messina]] (\"[[Bye, Bye (Jo Dee Messina song)|Bye, Bye]]\", \"[[I'm Alright (Jo Dee Messina song)|I'm Alright]]\"), [[Collin Raye]] (\"[[Little Red Rodeo]]\"), and [[Alan Jackson]] (\"[[Right on the Money]]\"). In 1999, he was named by [[American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers]] (ASCAP) as Country Songwriter of the Year.\n\nLater that same year, Vassar was signed to [[Arista Nashville]] as a recording artist. His debut album, ''[[Phil Vassar (album)|Phil Vassar]]'', was released in early 2000, producing five hits on the U.S. [[Hot Country Songs|''Billboard'' country singles charts]] and earning a gold certification in the United States. He followed it in 2002 with ''[[American Child]]'', ''[[Shaken Not Stirred (Phil Vassar album)|Shaken Not Stirred]]'' in 2004, and finally ''[[Greatest Hits, Vol. 1 (Phil Vassar album)|Greatest Hits, Vol. 1]]'' in 2006 before Vassar left the label for Universal South Records (now [[Show Dog-Universal Music]]). His first album for that label, ''[[Prayer of a Common Man]]'', was released in early 2008. He has charted nineteen singles on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'''s [[Hot Country Songs]], including two which peaked at No.&nbsp;1: 2000's \"[[Just Another Day in Paradise (song)|Just Another Day in Paradise]]\" and 2004's \"[[In a Real Love]]\".\n\n==Biography==\nVassar was born May 28, 1962, in [[Lynchburg, Virginia]].<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> He attended [[James Madison University]] in [[Harrisonburg, Virginia]]. While there, Vassar had taken up playing the piano, and eventually found work as a singer in clubs.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> He was also a member of the Eta Kappa chapter of the [[Theta Chi fraternity]]. He then decided to move to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], to pursue a career in music. Eventually, he was signed to a small publishing contract, but was unable to land any hits on this contract.\n\n==Musical career==\n\n===As a songwriter===\nStarting in the late 1990s, Vassar began writing songs that were recorded by several country music artists. Among the artists who recorded his material were [[Blackhawk (band)|Blackhawk]] (\"Postmarked Birmingham\"), [[Collin Raye]] (\"[[Little Red Rodeo]]\"), [[Jo Dee Messina]] (\"[[Bye, Bye (Jo Dee Messina song)|Bye, Bye]]\", \"[[I'm Alright (Jo Dee Messina song)|I'm Alright]]\"), [[Tim McGraw]] (\"[[For a Little While]]\"), [[Alan Jackson]] (\"[[Right on the Money]]\"), and [[Neal McCoy]] (\"I Was\").<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> Of them, \"Bye, Bye\", \"I'm Alright\", and \"Right on the Money\" all reached No.&nbsp;1 on the country chart. \"Bye, Bye\" earned Vassar his first [[American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers]] (ASCAP) award for Song of the Year, and in 1999 he was named ASCAP's Songwriter of the Year.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/>\n\n===As a singer===\n[[Image:Phil Vassar at Merced County Fair 2007.jpg|thumb|right|Phil Vassar (2007)]]\nIn late 1999, Vassar was signed to his first recording contract, with the [[Arista Nashville]] label. His debut single, \"[[Carlene (Phil Vassar song)|Carlene]]\", was issued that year, and by mid-2000 the song had gone on to peak at No.&nbsp;5 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country charts. It featured a backing vocal from [[Collin Raye]].<ref name=\"debut liner\">{{cite AV media notes |title=Phil Vassar |others=Phil Vassar |year=2000 |type=CD booklet |publisher=Arista Nashville |id=18891}}</ref>\n\nThe song was the lead-off single to Vassar's [[Phil Vassar (album)|self-titled debut album]], which he co-produced with [[Byron Gallimore]]. \"Carlene\" was followed by \"[[Just Another Day in Paradise (song)|Just Another Day in Paradise]]\", his first No.&nbsp;1 hit as a singer. Shortly after that song peaked, Tim McGraw topped the charts with \"[[My Next Thirty Years]]\", which Vassar co-wrote.  Overall, ''Phil Vassar'' produced three more singles: the No.&nbsp;16 \"[[Rose Bouquet]]\", \"[[Six-Pack Summer]]\" at No.&nbsp;9, and finally \"[[That's When I Love You]]\", with a backing vocal from [[Jo Dee Messina]],<ref name=\"debut liner\"/> at No.&nbsp;3. In addition, the album earned a gold certification from the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) for shipping 500,000 copies.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> Its success led to tours with [[Kenny Chesney]].\n\nVassar also co-wrote the tracks \"God Bless This Town\" and \"Live It Up\" on [[Marshall Dyllon]]'s late 2000 debut album ''[[Enjoy the Ride (Marshall Dyllon album)|Enjoy the Ride]]'', in addition to co-producing them with [[Robert Byrne (songwriter)|Robert Byrne]]. The latter was released as a single.<ref>{{cite AV media notes |title=Enjoy the Ride |others=Marshall Dyllon |year=2000 |publisher=Dreamcatcher Records |id=101}}</ref>\n\n===''American Child''===\n''[[American Child]]'' was Vassar's second album, once again co-produced with Gallimore. It was released in 2002, the same year in which he married Julie Wood, with whom he co-wrote \"That's When I Love You\". The album's title track served as its lead-off single, reaching a peak of No.&nbsp;5 on the country charts, and the album itself peaked at No.&nbsp;4 on the [[Top Country Albums]] charts. In mid-2002, he also co-wrote and performed a charity single called \"Words Are Your Wheels\" to promote literacy. Released exclusively through [[Walmart]] stores, this song featured guest vocals from [[Kenny Chesney]], [[Brooks & Dunn]], [[Martina McBride]], and [[Sara Evans]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/retail-trade/miscellaneous-retail-retail-stores-not/4655203-1.html|title=Co-writers Help Vassar Birth 'child' On Arista Nashville|last=Price|first=Deborah Evans|date=August 3, 2002|magazine=Billboard|access-date=April 29, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504175537/http://www.allbusiness.com/retail-trade/miscellaneous-retail-retail-stores-not/4655203-1.html|archive-date=May 4, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nWhile \"American Child\" was climbing the charts, Arista tested another song written by Vassar, \"[[This Is God]]\". The song was so well received by test audiences that ''American Child'' was re-released in early 2003. The re-issue featured \"This Is God\" along with a cover of [[Huey Lewis and the News]]'s \"[[Workin' for a Livin']]\", with [[Dann Huff]] producing both recordings. \"This Is God\" was issued as the album's second single, becoming a Top 20 country hit. After it, came \"Ultimate Love\", which peaked at No.&nbsp;41.\n\n===''Shaken Not Stirred'' and ''Greatest Hits''===\nIn 2004, Vassar released his third studio album, ''[[Shaken Not Stirred (Phil Vassar album)|Shaken Not Stirred]]''. The album produced Vassar's second No.&nbsp;1 as a singer in the song \"[[In a Real Love]]\". Also released from this album were the No.&nbsp;17 \"[[I'll Take That as a Yes (The Hot Tub Song)]]\" and the No.&nbsp;22 \"Good Ole Days\". Unlike with his first two albums, Vassar recorded ''Shaken Not Stirred'' with his road band. Vassar produced the album with [[Nick Brophy]] and [[Frank Rogers (record producer)|Frank Rogers]].\n\nVassar's first greatest hits compilation, ''[[Greatest Hits, Vol. 1 (Phil Vassar album)|Greatest Hits, Vol. 1]]'', was issued in 2006. This album comprised the biggest hits from his studio albums to that point, as well as his renditions of \"Bye, Bye\", \"I'm Alright\", \"My Next Thirty Years\", and \"Little Red Rodeo\". The album also included three new songs. Two were released as singles, starting with the No.&nbsp;2 \"[[Last Day of My Life]]\", which Vassar was inspired to write after attending the funeral of his friend Robert Byrne, with whom he co-wrote his 2001 single \"Rose Bouquet\".<ref name=\"kzax\">[http://www.kxaz.com/nmc_country/news/9997.html] {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> The second and final single from ''Greatest Hits'', \"[[The Woman in My Life]]\" (another song co-written by Vassar and his wife), reached No.&nbsp;20 on the country chart, shortly before Vassar parted ways with Arista Nashville.\n\n===''Prayer of a Common Man''===\nIn March 2007, Vassar signed to Universal South Records,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thatscountry.com/am2/publish/Country_News_2/003285.shtml |title=Phil Vassar signs with Universal South Records |access-date=May 3, 2008 |date=March 5, 2007 |work=That's Country |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080508021552/http://www.thatscountry.com/am2/publish/Country_News_2/003285.shtml |archive-date=May 8, 2008 }}</ref> which became part of [[Show Dog-Universal Music]] in December 2009.

A third single from this album, \"I Would\", was issued in July 2008 and peaked at No.&nbsp;26. It was followed in early 2009 by the album's title track, which became the lowest-peaking single of his career at No.&nbsp;53.\n\n===''Traveling Circus''===\nOne week after \"Prayer of a Common Man\" fell from the chart, Vassar charted his eighteenth single, \"Bobbi with an I\".
