The sister of country singer [[Tanya Tucker]], LaCosta charted several singles of her own in the 1970s on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country singles charts, including the No.&nbsp;3 \"Get on My Love Train.\"\n\n==Biography==\nBorn in [[Seminole, Texas]], Tucker moved around frequently, as her father Beau Tucker was a construction worker. Tucker had two siblings, Donald, and younger sister, [[Tanya Tucker]]. Beau felt LaCosta had the talent to be a star, and Tucker won her first talent contest at age four. In between entering beauty pageants and talent shows, she performed with Tanya in a band called the Country Westerners. She graduated from [[Cochise College]] in [[Douglas, Arizona]], and began working as a medical records technician as she sang in clubs and became Miss Country Music, Phoenix.\n\nLaCosta met and married airline pilot Darrell Sorensen, who fathered her children and also managed her career. It was around this time that [[Tanya Tucker|Tanya]] was becoming a country music star. LaCosta chose to move to [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], to be near her; in 1974, Beau Tucker helped LaCosta get a recording contract with [[Capitol Records]]. Going only by LaCosta, she soon had a hit record with \"I Wanta Get To You,\" which landed at 25 on the country charts, followed by \"Get on My Love Train\" at number 3, and \"He Took Me for a Ride\" at number 10.<ref name=\"Whitburn\">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2008|publisher=Record Research, Inc|year=2008|page=229|isbn=978-0-89820-177-2}}</ref> She charted ten more singles for Capitol and recorded five albums for the label. In 1982 she moved to [[Elektra Records]], and she charted with \"Love Take It Easy On Me,\" under her full name of LaCosta Tucker.<ref name=\"Whitburn\"/>\n\nIn 1989 LaCosta toured with Tanya and by the 1990s was serving as president of Tanya's fan club. She raised two children, and for a time, made gourmet candy for sale on her sister's website.\n\nMany of LaCosta Tucker's recordings are out of print, but a 2000 release, ''Sisters: An Anthology'', contains some of her hits packaged together with Tanya's material.<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00004TWT7/ ''Sisters: An Anthology'' at Amazon.com]</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" \n|-\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:16em;\"| Title\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:18em;\"| Album details\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"1\"| Peak<br>chart<br>positions\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\"| [[Top Country Albums|US<br>Country]]<br><ref>{{cite magazine |title=La Costa Chart History (Top Country Albums) |url=https://www.billboard.com/music/la-costa/chart-history/country-albums |magazine=Billboard |accessdate=June 19, 2019}}{{dead link|date=December 2021|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n|-\n! scope = \"row\" | ''Get on My Love Train''\n|\n*Released: October 21, 1974\n*Label: [[Capitol Records|Capitol]]\n*Format: [[Gramophone record|LP]]\n| 6\n|-\n! scope = \"row\" | ''With All My Love''\n|\n*Released: April 21, 1975\n*Label: Capitol\n*Format: LP\n| 33\n|-\n! scope = \"row\" | ''Lovin' Somebody''\n|\n*Released: September 27, 1976\n*Label: Capitol\n*Format: LP\n| 31\n|-\n! scope = \"row\" | ''La Costa''\n|\n*Released: October 17, 1977\n*Label: Capitol\n*Format: LP\n| —\n|-\n! scope = \"row\" | ''Changin' All the Time''\n|\n*Released: July 14, 1980\n*Label: Capitol\n*Format: LP\n| —\n|-\n|}\n\n===Singles===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Title\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Year\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\"| Peak chart<br>positions\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Album\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\"| [[Hot Country Songs|US<br>Country]]<br><ref>{{cite magazine |title=La Costa Chart History (Hot Country Songs) |url=https://www.billboard.com/music/la-costa/chart-history/country-songs |magazine=Billboard |accessdate=June 19, 2019}}{{dead link|date=December 2021|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\"| [[RPM (magazine)|CAN<br>Country]]\n|-\n! scope = \"row\" | \"I Wanta Get to You\"\n|rowspan=2|1974\n|25\n|—\n|rowspan=3|''Get on My Love Train''\n|-\n! scope = \"row\" | \"Get on My Love Train\"\n|3\n|6\n|-\n! scope = \"row\" | \"He Took Me for a Ride\"\n|rowspan=3|1975\n|10\n|21\n|-\n! scope = \"row\" | \"This House Runs on Sunshine\"\n|19\n|15\n|''With All My Love''\n|-\n! scope = \"row\" | \"Western Man\"\n|11\n|10\n| {{n/a|Non-album single}}\n|-\n! scope = \"row\" | \"I Just Got a Feeling\"\n|rowspan=3|1976\n|28\n|—\n|''With All My Love''\n|-\n! scope = \"row\" | \"Lovin' Somebody on a Rainy Night\"\n|23\n|17\n|rowspan=2|''Lovin' Somebody''\n|-\n! scope = \"row\" | \"What'll I Do\"\n|37\n|28\n|-\n! scope = \"row\" | \"We're All Alone\"\n|rowspan=2|1977\n|75\n|—\n| {{n/a|Non-album single}}\n|-\n! scope = \"row\" | \"Jessie and the Light\"\n|100\n|—\n|rowspan=3|''LaCosta''\n|-\n! scope = \"row\" | \"[[Even Cowgirls Get the Blues (song)|Even Cowgirls Get the Blues]]\"\n|rowspan=2|1978\n|79\n|—\n|-\n! scope = \"row\" | \"#1 with a Heartache\"\n|94\n|—\n|-\n! scope = \"row\" | \"Changing All the Time\"\n| rowspan = \"2\" |1980\n|68\n|—\n| rowspan = \"2\" |''Changin' All the Time''\n|-\n! scope = \"row\" | \"It Was Time\"\n|—\n|—\n|-\n! scope = \"row\" | \"Love Take It Easy on Me\"\n|1982\n|48\n|—\n| {{n/a|Non-album single}}\n|-\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Tanya Tucker}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:La Costa}}\n[[Category:1951 births]]\n[[Category:American women country singers]]\n[[Category:American country singer-songwriters]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Capitol Records artists]]\n[[Category:People from Seminole, Texas]]\n[[Category:Singer-songwriters from Texas]]\n[[Category:Country musicians from Texas]]\n[[Category:21st-century American women]]"
