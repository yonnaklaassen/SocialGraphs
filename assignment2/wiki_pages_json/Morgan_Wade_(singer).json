Active since 2018, she released the album ''[[Reckless (Morgan Wade album)|Reckless]]'' in 2021, followed by ''[[Psychopath (album)|Psychopath]]'' in 2023 and ''[[Obsessed (Morgan Wade album)|Obsessed]]'' in 2024.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life and career===\nMorgan Wade is a native of [[Floyd, Virginia]]. She began writing songs as a freshman in college, and in 2018, she recruited musicians through [[Craigslist]] to record her first album ''Puppets with My Heart'', which was credited to the Stepbrothers. Wade told ''Rolling Stone Country'' that she was inspired to do this after breaking up with her boyfriend.<ref name=\"stone\">{{cite web | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/morgan-wade-reckless-album-1150202/ | title=Morgan Wade, Raised on Bluegrass, Excels at Country-Pop on Her Debut Album | publisher=Rolling Stone Country | date=April 1, 2021 | access-date=October 22, 2021}}</ref> Wade later said that the stress of touring and recording with the Stepbrothers led to her developing an alcohol addiction.<ref name=\"stone\"/>\n\nLater in 2018, Wade was performing at FloydFest along with many artists including [[Jason Isbell]]. Isbell's sound engineer gave her album to [[Sadler Vaden]], the guitarist in Isbell's band the 400 Unit.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://theboot.com/morgan-wade-reckless-interview-2021/ | title=Morgan Wade Sets Release Day for 'Reckless', a Debut Album for the Ages | website=The Boot | date=22 January 2021 }}</ref>\n\n===''Reckless'' (2021–2022)===\nSadler Vaden and producer Paul Ebersold then helped her assemble another album over the next two years.

In a voice like worn leather, Wade describes desperate, spontaneous relationships that feel the strongest when they’re at their breaking point.\"<ref name=\"stone\"/>\n\n\"Wilder Days\" was released to radio in 2021 as the album's first single.
