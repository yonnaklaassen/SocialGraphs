He had 70 chart singles, including two number one hits on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s country chart.

''Billboard''{{'}}s 100th anniversary issue listed it as the second most successful country single of the [[rock and roll]] era. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].<ref name=\"Golden Discs\">{{cite book |last1=Murrells |first1=Joseph |title=The Book of Golden Discs |date=1978 |publisher=Barrie and Jenkins Ltd |location=London |isbn=0-214-20512-6 |edition=2nd |url=https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/126}}</ref>\n\nLocklin was born and raised in Florida. He developed a fondness for country music following an accident in his childhood. He learned to play the guitar during his recovery and began performing locally as well. In his early adulthood, he formed his own band called the Rocky Mountain Playboys, which played gigs and performed on local radio. Locklin was heard singing during one of these gigs, which led to his first recording contract in 1949. He had his first major hit on the ''Billboard'' country chart the same year. His 1953 single \"[[Let Me Be the One (Hank Locklin song)|Let Me Be the One]]\" was his first to top the country chart.\n\nIn 1955, Locklin signed with [[RCA Records|RCA Victor Records]] and under the production of [[Chet Atkins]], he had his biggest success as a country artist. He had a string of major hits during the late 1950s and early 1960s. He also joined the cast of the [[Grand Ole Opry]] and remained a member for nearly 50 years. He became a major concert attraction internationally as well, touring overseas in Europe beginning in the 1960s and 70s. Locklin also recorded a handful of concept albums during this period, which made him among the genre's first artists to release albums centered around a theme. He later recorded for other labels, including [[MGM Records|MGM]], [[Plantation Records|Plantation]] and Coldwater. Despite his country success, Locklin never lived in Nashville, choosing to stay in Florida. Locklin died in 2009 at the age of 91.\n\n==Early life==\nLocklin was born and raised in [[McLellan, Florida]]. He was the youngest of four children born to a musically inclined family.

To pursue his music full-time, Locklin dropped out of high school. However, working as a musician amounted to a small income. In one instance, he recalled being paid $2 for working a gig at a Florida roadhouse.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia\"/> To make ends meet, he worked odd jobs, including working on a farm and a shipyard.<ref name=\"NY Times\"/>\n\nDuring the early 1940s, Locklin was dismissed from participating in World War II due to the bus accident in his childhood (which still affected his leg). Instead, he continued performing. Locklin performed in nearby states, including regular gigs with bands in [[Mobile, Alabama]]. He also began composing his own material, largely influenced by the music of [[Ernest Tubb]]. He then joined the band of country musician [[Jimmy Swan]] and made regular concert appearances. Locklin formed his own backing band in 1947 named the Rocky Mountain Playboys. The group performed regularly on radio stations. Their sponsor was businessman Elmer Laird, who intended to form a record label to get Locklin's music recorded. However, he was killed in a stabbing incident shortly after his proposal.<ref name=\"Allmusic Bio\"/> Instead, Locklin's association with producer [[Pappy Daily]] helped him sign with [[Four Star Records]].<ref name=\"Country Standard Time\">{{cite web |last1=Burke |first1=Ken |title=Hungry Hank Locklin returns with \"Generations in Song\" |url=https://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/article.asp?xid=573 |website=Country Standard Time |access-date=30 November 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"CMT\">{{cite web |title=Grand Ole Opry Member Hank Locklin Dies at Age 91 |url=http://www.cmt.com/news/1606538/grand-ole-opry-member-hank-locklin-dies-at-age-91/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210210215111/http://www.cmt.com/news/1606538/grand-ole-opry-member-hank-locklin-dies-at-age-91/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 10, 2021 |website=[[Country Music Television]] |access-date=30 November 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===1949–1954: Early success===\nLocklin secured a contract with Four Star Records through his association with Pappy Daily.

Because his recording contract allowed for McCall to gain all of the publishing rights, McCall also made all the money from its success. \"I never made no money with him. My understanding was that he liked to go to Vegas. I guess Bill was just a guy who liked to take everything,\" Locklin recalled in 2001.<ref name=\"Country Standard Time\"/>\n\nLocklin's follow-up singles did not become hits, which caused further financial difficulties.<ref name=\"Allmusic Bio\"/> He even recorded the original version of his future hit \"Send Me the Pillow You Dream On\". Although it was not a hit, Locklin did recall the song getting a warm reception after he performed it live on a radio show.<ref name=\"Country Standard Time\"/> By this time, McCall had arranged for Locklin's material to be leased to [[Decca Records]], which was headed by [[Owen Bradley]]. With this partnership, he had his second major hit in 1953 titled \"[[Let Me Be the One (Hank Locklin song)|Let Me Be the One]]\".<ref name=\"Allmusic Bio\"/> The single became his first to reach the number one position on the ''Billboard'' country chart. \"Let Me Be the One\" spent a total of three weeks at the country chart summit. His follow-up Four Star releases were unsuccessful.<ref name=\"Billboard Singles\"/> Furthermore, Locklin still was receiving little royalties from his success with the label. In order for McCall to not claim them as his own, he started composing songs under his wife's name. Cuts such as \"These Ruins Belong to You\" were written under the pen name Willa. After an argument with McCall, he left Four Star Records.<ref name=\"Independent\"/>\n\n===1955–1974: Move to RCA Records and biggest success===\nIn 1955, Locklin switched to the larger [[RCA Records]]. Collaborating with producer [[Chet Atkins]], Locklin developed a simpler musical style. His recordings often included heavy [[acoustic guitar]] and [[piano]] production.<ref name=\"Allmusic Bio\"/> These styles were individualized by that of [[The Nashville A-Team]], a group of studio musicians that included [[Floyd Cramer]] and several others.<ref name=\"Allmusic Bio\"/><ref name=\"Independent\"/> In 1956, he had his first hit with RCA titled \"[[Why Baby Why]]\". The single reached the top 10 of the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Songs|Country & Western Records Most Played By Folk Disk Jockeys]] chart, becoming his first major hit in three years.<ref name=\"Billboard Singles\"/> It was followed in 1957 by \"[[Geisha Girl (song)|Geisha Girl]]\".<ref name=\"Independent\"/> The song reached number five on the ''Billboard'' country chart,<ref name=\"Billboard Singles\"/> and was his first to reach the [[Billboard Hot 100|pop chart]], climbing to number 66.<ref name=\"Pop Singles\">{{cite book |last1=Whitburn |first1=Joel |title=Joel Whitburn's Billboard Top Pop Singles 1955-2006 |date=2008 |publisher=Record Research |isbn=978-0898201727}}</ref> The hit was included on his debut studio album ''[[Foreign Love]].'' Marketed toward overseas servicemen, the record was one of several [[concept album]]s released by Locklin during his career.<ref name=\"Independent\"/> In 1958, Locklin had major hits with \"[[It's a Little More Like Heaven]]\" and a remake of \"Send Me the Pillow You Dream On\".<ref name=\"Billboard Singles\"/>\n\nLocklin's singles over the next two years were unsuccessful.<ref name=\"Billboard Singles\"/> In 1960, he was brought to the attention of a song composed by Hal Blair and [[Don Robertson (songwriter)|Don Robertson]]. Both writers had the idea of writing a \"cheating song\" that centered around a man's conscience. Blair brought in elements from his own marital troubles to write the song. Their finished product was the tune \"[[Please Help Me, I'm Falling]]\". The song was first offered to [[Jim Reeves]], who turned it down. Locklin believed it to be a hit and decided to cut it in the studio.<ref name=\"Independent\"/> Released as a single in 1960, \"Please Help Me, I'm Falling\" reached number one on the ''Billboard'' country songs chart in May.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=\"Please Help Me, I'm Falling\" (Country Songs) |url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/hank-locklin/chart-history/csi/ |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=1 December 2020}}</ref> It spent a total of 14 weeks at the top of country charts.<ref name=\"NY Times\"/> It also became Locklin's biggest hit on the ''Billboard'' pop chart, reaching the number eight position in August 1960.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=\"Please Help Me, I'm Falling\" chart history |url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/hank-locklin/chart-history/hsi/ |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=1 December 2020}}</ref> In the United Kingdom, the song reached the top 10 of the national charts as well.<ref name=\"UK Singles\">{{cite book|title=Guinness World Records British Hit Singles 15th Edition|year=2002|page=301|publisher=[[Guinness World Records]] Limited|location= London, UK|isbn=0-85112-187-X}}</ref> \"Please Help Me, I'm Falling\" became the biggest hit of Locklin's career and his biggest-selling single.<ref name=\"Billboard Singles\"/> The song's success led to an invitation to join the [[Grand Ole Opry]], which he accepted in 1960.

His early records on the Four Star label embodied this particular style. His early songs also took influence from other artists, including [[Hank Williams]]. In reviewing Locklin's 1997 compilation, Bruce Eder wrote that songs such as \"Born to Ramble\" drew a strong influence from Williams.<ref name=\"Eder\">{{cite web |last1=Eder |first1=Bruce |title=''Send Me the Pillow That You Dream On'': Hank Williams: Songs, Reviews, Credits |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/send-me-the-pillow-you-dream-on-box-set-mw0000604808 |website=[[Allmusic]] |access-date=4 December 2020}}</ref> Locklin also emulated the musical styles of Ernest Tubb (among the artists responsible for the formation of country's honky-tonk style).<ref name=\"Allmusic Bio\"/>\n\nLocklin's sound and style became individualized once he signed with RCA Records in 1955.<ref name=\"Allmusic Bio\"/> His producer Chet Atkins helped create his image by incorporating a softer Nashville Sound instrumentation. Writer Greg Adams described Locklin's RCA years as having \"sweet vocal choruses\" backed by horn and string sections.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Adams |first1=Greg |title=''Please Help Me I'm Falling'': Hank Locklin: Songs, Reviews, Credits |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/please-help-me-im-falling-box-set-mw0000645770 |website=[[Allmusic]] |access-date=4 December 2020}}</ref> In a 2001 interview, Locklin recounted how Chet Atkins created musical arrangements by using the guitar he kept in his office: \"Then, all of a sudden he'd pick it up and hit a chord or two on something or other that floated through his head. He was so good, and he really helped me a lot with RCA.\"<ref name=\"Country Standard Time\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\nLocklin is considered by many writers to be one of country music's \"great tenors.\"<ref name=\"Allmusic Bio\"/><ref>{{cite web |title=Hank Locklin Obituary (2009) |url=https://obits.tennessean.com/obituaries/tennessean/obituary.aspx?n=hank-locklin&pid=125010822 |website=[[The Tennessean|Tennessean]] |access-date=4 December 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"NY Times\"/> Critics have noted that his distinctive high-pitch singing made him standout from other performers of the era. In a review of the compilation ''RCA Country Legends,'' [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] highlighted this characteristic: \"Locklin held firm to his country ideals, and whittled down to the essentials as they are here, they offer proof of why country connoisseurs consider him among the best pure singers in the genre.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Erlewine |first1=Stephen |title=''RCA Country Legends'': Hank Locklin: Songs, Reviews, Credits |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/rca-country-legends-mw0000021785 |website=[[Allmusic]] |access-date=4 December 2020}}</ref> Locklin also helped define the [[Nashville Sound]] sub-genre of country music.<ref name=\"NY Times\"/> This particular style brought a cosmopolitan feel and a smooth quality to country music. \"I’ve been blessed to have hit songs that are timeless,\" Locklin commented in 2001.<ref>{{cite web |title=Country music star Hank Locklin, 91, dies |url=https://oklahoman.com/article/3351850/country-music-star-hank-locklin-91-dies |website=[[The Oklahoman]] |date=March 10, 2009 |access-date=4 December 2020}}</ref>\n\nLocklin's legacy can be linked with his 49-year membership to the Grand Ole Opry. He was known for his \"folksy\" style of humor and often joked with his Opry audience by saying \"We’ll treat you so many ways you’re bound to like one of ’em.\"<ref name=\"NY Times\"/> In 2007 he was inducted to the [[Florida Artists Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.florida-arts.org/programs/ahf/displayArtist.cfm?member=40 |title=Lawrence Hankins \"Hank \" Locklin – Division of Cultural Affairs – Florida Department of State |publisher=Florida-arts.org |access-date=August 18, 2015}}</ref> In November 2020, PBS aired a documentary on Locklin's career and legacy titled ''Hank Locklin: Country Music's Timeless Tenor.''
