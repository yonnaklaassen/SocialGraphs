His father wanted to be a pro athlete and was courted by the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]], but instead, he got a job in Fort Worth with the [[Tandy Corporation]]. Burnett was brought up in the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] of his mother. He forgot the origin of his nickname, which he uses without a dash.\n\nBurnett learned golf at an early age. When he was seven years old, he played at the [[Texas Christian University]] course. He idolized golf pro [[Ben Hogan]], who was from Fort Worth. Burnett and the other boys occasionally watched him practice at the [[driving range]]. Burnett was on the golf team at [[Paschal High School]].

He was drawn to music that took him to unconventional places, and he felt no compulsion to stick to one genre. He heard [[Peggy Lee]], [[Hank Williams]], and [[the Beatles]] on the radio, was influenced by [[Buddy Holly]], and revered [[Johnny Cash]]. He was smitten by the music of [[Howlin' Wolf]], [[Skip James]], [[the Stanley Brothers]], and [[Jimmy Reed]].<ref name=\"sachs\"/>\n\nHe also learned about music through his friend, [[Stephen Bruton]]. Bruton's father was a jazz drummer who owned a music store on the [[Texas Christian University]] campus, where the boys spent many weekends. Bruton, a [[banjo]]ist, revealed his interest in [[bluegrass music]] and [[field recording]]s from the 1920s and 1930s. Burnett was enamored with the live version of the song \"Wrought Iron Rag\" by the [[Dixieland]] revival band [[Wilbur de Paris]] and His New New Orleans Jazz. The boys would sneak into clubs to hear bands.<ref name=\"sachs\"/>{{rp|12}}\n\nAt around the same age, Burnett picked up the guitar. Overwhelmed by seeing the Beatles on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', he started [[garage band]]s with Bruton. After graduating from high school in 1965, they spent most of their time at Sound City, a recording studio in the basement of a radio station where Burnett became fascinated by recording. Forming the band The Loose Ends and adopting the stage name Jon T. Bone, Burnett wrote and recorded a 1966 single \"Free Soul\"/\"He's A Nobody\".  The b-side briefly charted on local Fort Worth radio station KFJZ, and the single was picked up for national distribution by [[Mala Records]], though it made no national chart listings.  A second Loose Ends single (\"Dead End Kid\"/\"Verses\") appeared on [[Bell Records]] in 1967, but didn't chart regionally or nationally. This 1967 single was written and co-produced by Burnett (still using the alias \"Jon T. Bone\"), and was his first production credit.\n\nBurnett's parents had divorced when he was in high school, and his father, with whom he was living, died in 1967.

His 1983 album ''[[Proof Through the Night]]'',<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> whose song \"When the Night Falls\" got some FM airplay, and his 1987 album ''[[The Talking Animals]]'' were more in the vein of 1980s [[new wave music]], while his self-titled 1986 album was an album of acoustic [[country music]]. His 1992 album ''[[The Criminal Under My Own Hat]]'' tended toward [[adult album alternative]] music.\n\n''Proof Through the Night'' was reissued by Rhino Records' Handmade Music in a limited edition of 5,000 on May 29, 2007, in an expanded version.
