During the peak years of his recording career (1966–1987), he had 52 top-10 hits on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] chart, 30 of which made it to number one. Songs such as \"[[All I Have to Offer You (Is Me)]]\", \"[[Is Anybody Goin' to San Antone]]\", and \"[[Kiss an Angel Good Mornin']]\", among others, typified the \"[[Nashville sound#Countrypolitan|countrypolitan]]\" style that made him famous and became crossover-[[Pop music|pop]] hits. He won the Entertainer of the Year award at the [[Country Music Association Awards]] in 1971 and was awarded a Grammy for \"Best Country Vocal Performance, Male\" in 1972. Pride later ventured into [[gospel music]], releasing his first gospel album ''[[Did You Think to Pray]]'' in 1971. In 1973 he performed \"[[River Song (Sherman)|The River Song]]\" from the motion picture musical ''[[Tom Sawyer (1973 film)|Tom Sawyer]]''.\n\nPride is one of three [[African Americans|African-American]] [[List of Grand Ole Opry Members|member]]s of the [[Grand Ole Opry]] (the others being [[DeFord Bailey]] and [[Darius Rucker]]).

Later that season, while in the Negro leagues with the [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] Clippers, two players – Pride and Jesse Mitchell – were traded to the [[Birmingham Black Barons]] for a team bus. \"Jesse and I may have the distinction of being the only players in history to be traded for a used motor vehicle,\" Pride mused in his 1994 autobiography.<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Hughes |first1=William |title=R.I.P.

He also played gigs in the local area, both solo and with a band called the Night Hawks,<ref name=\"HelenaHistory2010\" /> and Asarco asked him to sing at company picnics.<ref name=\"D'Ambrosio\" /> His job at the smelter was dangerous and difficult; he once broke his ankle.

On the records of this song submitted to radio stations for [[airplay]], the singer was listed as \"Country Charley Pride\". Pride disputes that the omission of a photo was deliberate; he stated that getting promoters to bring in a Black country singer was a bigger problem: \"People didn't care if I was pink. RCA signed me&nbsp;... they knew I was colored&nbsp;... They decided to put the record out and let it speak for itself.\"<ref name=\"D'Ambrosio\" /> While living in Montana, he continued to sing at local clubs, and in Great Falls had an additional boost to his career when he befriended local businessman Louis Allen \"Al\" Donohue, who owned radio stations, including [[KMON (AM)|KMON]], the first stations to play Pride's records in Montana.<ref name=\"D'Ambrosio\" />\n\nSoon after the release of \"The Snakes Crawl at Night\", Pride released another single called \"Before I Met You\", which also did not chart. Not long afterwards, his third single, \"Just Between You and Me\", was released. This song finally brought Pride success on the country charts.

Pride was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] for the song the next year. In the late summer of 1966, on the strength of his early releases, he was booked for his first large show, in Detroit's [[Detroit Olympia|Olympia Stadium]]. Since no biographical information had been included with those singles, few of the 10,000 country fans who came to the show knew Pride was Black and discovered the fact only when he walked onto the stage, at which point the applause trickled off to silence. \"I knew I'd have to get it over with sooner or later,\" Pride later remembered. \"I told the audience: 'Friends, I realize it's a little unique, me coming out here&nbsp;– with a permanent suntan&nbsp;– to sing country and western to you.
