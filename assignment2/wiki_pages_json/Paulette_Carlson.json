With Highway 101, she charted four No.&nbsp;1 hit singles, seven Top 10 hits and won two [[Country Music Association Awards]]. As a solo artist, she has charted five times on [[Hot Country Songs]] and recorded three studio albums. Her most successful solo single is \"I'll Start with You\", which peaked at number 21 in 1991. Carlson continues to tour and record new music as a solo artist.\n\n==Beginnings==\nPaulette Carlson began professionally singing in the dance bars in Fargo, ND, and in the Minneapolis, MN, area and built a large local following before heading to Nashville in 1978. Soon after arriving in Nashville she was signed as a staff songwriter for the [[Oak Ridge Boys]]’ Silverline/Goldline Publishing Company. She signed a singles contract with [[RCA Records]] and released three singles: \"You Gotta Get to My Heart\",  \"I’d Say Yes\", and \"Can You Fool\".\n\n==Highway 101==\n{{main|Highway 101}}\nCarlson founded [[Highway 101]] in 1986 with [[session musician]]s Jack Daniels, Scott \"Cactus\" Moser, and Curtis Stone. The band was signed to [[Warner Bros. Records]] with [[Paul Worley]] producing. Carlson recorded three albums, a Greatest Hits package, and 12 singles for the group before leaving in 1991. Nikki Nelson replaced her as lead vocalist that year.\n\n==Solo==\nCarlson signed with [[Capitol Nashville]] in 1991 and released ''[[Love Goes On (Paulette Carlson album)|Love Goes On]]'', which she produced with [[Jimmy Bowen]]. She also co-wrote seven of the album's ten tracks. The first single, \"I’ll Start With You\" charted at number 21, and \"Not with My Heart You Don't\" charted at number 68. A third single, \"The Chain Just Broke\", failed to chart, and Carlson exited Capitol. Also in 1992, she was nominated for [[Academy of Country Music Award for New Female Artist of the Year|Top New Female Vocalist]] at the [[Academy of Country Music Awards]], along with [[Ronna Reeves]] and [[Trisha Yearwood]], but lost to Trisha.\n\n''Christmas Is For You'', a Christmas album, was released in 1993 under a small independent label. Carlson produced this album and wrote two songs for the project, \"Christmas is for You\" and \"Mrs. Santa Claus.\"  Both songs were made into music videos, one where her daughter, Cali, appeared in the \"Christmas Is For You\" video.\n\n==Reunited with Highway 101==\nMarking Highway 101's Tenth Year Anniversary, Carlson reunited with original members, Curtis Stone and Jack Daniels.  They released two albums, ''[[Reunited (Highway 101 album)|Reunited]]'' and ''Latest & Greatest''. \"Where’d You Get Your Cheatin’ From\", \"It Must be Love\" and \"I Just Don't Love the Man\" were released as singles (1996 and 1997).\n\n==Present==\nIn 2004, when her brother Gary, a Vietnam War veteran, was in the hospital, Carlson was inspired to write a song called \"Thank You Vets\".  After writing the song, she came out of retirement and recorded a new album, penning 10 of the 12 songs. ''It's About Time'' (2005) was released under Pandean Records. She toured briefly after recording this album dedicated to our Vietnam Vets, doing mostly benefits for Military Veterans.\n\nToday, Carlson has returned to performing and tours with a backing band called Montana Rising.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/paulettecarlsonmusic/ |title=Paulette Carlson – Home |website=Facebook.com |date= |accessdate=April 12, 2020}}</ref> She is currently represented by Gerald Murray Music, an independent agency which specialize in artist management, booking, tour management and the development of performing artists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geraldmurraymusic.com/paulettecarlson.html |title=Book Paulette Carlson &#124; Gerald Murray Music &#124; Artist Management &#124; Booking Agency |publisher=Gerald Murray Music |date= |accessdate=April 12, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n===Albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:14em;\"| Title\n! style=\"width:20em;\"| Album details\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[Love Goes On (Paulette Carlson album)|Love Goes On]]''<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-All-Music/Billboard/90s/1991/BB-1991-12-14.pdf|title=Album Reviews|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|page=51|date=December 14, 1991}}</ref>\n| \n* Release date: December 14, 1991\n* Label: [[Capitol Records]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Christmas Is for You''\n| \n* Release date: September 13, 1994\n* Label: Majestic Records\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''It's About Time''\n| \n* Release date: June 13, 2006\n* Label: Pandean Records\n|}\n\n===Singles===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Year\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:30em;\"| Single\n! colspan=\"2\"| Peak chart<br />positions\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Album\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n! style=\"width:45px;\"| [[Hot Country Songs|US Country]]<br /><ref name=\"whitburn\">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2008|publisher=Record Research, Inc|year=2008|page=79|isbn=978-0-89820-177-2}}</ref>\n! style=\"width:45px;\"| [[RPM (magazine)|CAN Country]]\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 1983\n! scope=\"row\"| \"You Gotta Get to My Heart (Before You Lay a Hand on Me)\"\n| 65\n| —\n| rowspan=\"3\" {{n/a}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"I'd Say Yes\"\n| 67\n| —\n|-\n| 1984\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Can You Fool\"\n| 72\n| —\n|-\n| 1991\n! scope=\"row\"| \"[[I'll Start with You]]\"<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-All-Music/Billboard/90s/1991/BB-1991-11-23.pdf|title=Single Reviews|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=November 23, 1991}}</ref>\n| 21\n| 50\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" rowspan=\"3\"| ''Love Goes On''\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 1992\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Not with My Heart You Don't\"\n| 68\n| 84\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"The Chain Just Broke\"<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Billboard/90s/1992/Billboard-1992-07-11.pdf|title=Single Reviews|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=July 11, 1992}}</ref>\n| —\n| —\n|-\n| 2005\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Thank You Vets\"\n| —\n| —\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" rowspan=\"3\"| ''It's About Time''\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 2006\n! scope=\"row\"| \"I Knew a Good Thing When I Had it\"\n| —\n| —\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"That Old Glass Case\"\n| —\n| —\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" style=\"font-size:8pt\"| \"—\" denotes releases that did not chart\n|}\n\n===Music videos===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!
