Originating in [[Alabama]], but gaining success after the Maddox family relocated to [[California]] during the [[Great Depression]], the group were among the earliest \"hillbilly music\" stars to emerge from the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]]. The group disbanded in 1956, with Rose Maddox embarking on a solo career.\n\n==Biography==\nThe family hailed from [[Boaz, Alabama]], United States, but [[Freighthopping|rode the rails]] and [[hitch-hike]]d to California in 1933 when the band members were still children, following the failed efforts of their [[sharecropping|sharecropper]] parents  during the early part of the [[Great Depression|Depression]]. They were a little in advance of the flood of [[Okie]]s who were to flood the state in the 1930s. They struggled to make a living as itinerant fruit and vegetable pickers, following the harvest as far north as Washington and as far east as Arizona, as well as the [[San Joaquin Valley]]. They often worked from dawn to dusk, sleeping and eating on the ground.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/programs/morning/features/2003/honkytonks/index.html#part7|title=NPR : Honky Tonks, Hymns and the Blues<!-- Bot generated title -->|website=Npr.org|accessdate=February 14, 2020}}}</ref>\n\nHaving settled in [[Modesto, California]], the family developed their musical ability, and in 1937, performed on the radio, sponsored by a local furniture store. In 1939, they entered a hillbilly band competition at the centennial [[California State Fair|Sacramento State Fair]] after driving to [[Sacramento]] in their [[Ford Model A (1927–1931)|Model A]]. When they took the stage, they tore through \"Sally Let Your Bangs Hang Down\" with rocking rhythms and risqué lyrics. They became, officially, California's best hillbilly band.<ref>Ramblin' Rose - The Life and Times of Rose Maddox.

Some 4 Star masters were leased and released by US.-[[Decca Records]] at the beginning of the 1950s. Rose Maddox stated: \"We were called hillbilly singers — not country — then. No, none of this country music then. People just called us hillbilly... People tell me that I was one of the first women to sing what I sang — country boogie. I guess I was. There was no rock 'n' roll in those early days, before 1955. Only country boogie. My brothers also played that way.
