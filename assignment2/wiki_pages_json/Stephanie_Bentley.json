She made her debut in 1996 as a duet partner on [[Ty Herndon]]'s single \"Heart Half Empty\", which peaked at No.&nbsp;21 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Singles & Tracks]] charts. The single was included both on Herndon's 1995 debut album ''[[What Mattered Most]]'' and on Bentley's 1996 debut album ''[[Hopechest]]''. It produced three more singles for her on the country charts, although only one (\"Who's That Girl\") reached Top 40.\n\nBentley found success as a songwriter, having penned [[Faith Hill]]'s 1999 crossover single \"[[Breathe (Faith Hill song)|Breathe]]\", as well as [[Martina McBride]]'s 2002 Top 5 hit \"[[Concrete Angel]]\".

The three later toured briefly as a musical group, even singing for President [[Jimmy Carter]],<ref name=\"media\">[{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p55988|pure_url=yes}} AllMusic ((( Stephanie Bentley > Overview )))]</ref> In 1984, she formed a band called Special Delivery.<ref name=\"cst\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/article.asp?xid=281|title=Stephanie Bentley hopes debut brings chestful of success – January 1996|website=Countrystandardtime.com|accessdate=April 14, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Move to Tennessee===\nIn 1991, she moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], where she worked as a demo singer.
