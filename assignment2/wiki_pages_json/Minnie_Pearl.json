Sewell Production Company, a touring theater company based in Atlanta. She produced and directed plays and [[musical theatre|musicals]] for local organizations in small towns throughout the [[Southeastern United States|Southeast]].<ref name=HallofFame/><ref name=CMTbio/>\n\nPart of her work involved making brief appearances at civic organizations to promote the group's shows, and during this time she developed her Minnie Pearl routine.<ref name=CMTbio/> While producing an amateur musical comedy in [[Baileyton, Alabama]] she met a [[hillbilly|mountain woman]] whose style and speech became the basis for \"Cousin Minnie Pearl\".<ref name=HallofFame/> Her first stage performance as Minnie Pearl was in 1939 in [[Aiken, South Carolina]].<ref name= HallofFame/> Her character's now-famous trademark hat was purchased downtown at Surasky Bros. Department store before the show. The following year, executives from Nashville radio station [[WSM (AM)|WSM]] saw her perform at a bankers' convention in Centerville and gave her an opportunity to appear on the [[Grand Ole Opry]] on November 30, 1940.<ref name=HallofFame/><ref name=CMTbio/> The success of her debut on the show began an association with the Grand Ole Opry that continued for more than 50 years.<ref name = \"McCusker\">{{cite book| author = Edward T.

She lived in the fictional town of Grinders Switch. Pearl always dressed in frilly \"down home\" dresses and wore a hat with a price tag hanging from it, displaying the $1.98 price. Her signature greeting to her audience was an elongated \"Howdy! I'm just so proud to be here!\" delivered in a hearty holler.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/minnie-pearl-mn0000494750/biography | title=Minnie Pearl Biography, Songs, & Albums | website=[[AllMusic]] }}</ref> After she became an established star, her greeting became a call-and-response with audiences everywhere. Pearl's often self-deprecating humor involved her unsuccessful attempts to attract \"a feller's\" attention and, in later years, her age. She also spun stories involving her comical \"ne'er-do-well\" relatives, notably \"Uncle Nabob\", his wife \"Aunt Ambrosia\", \"Lucifer Hucklehead\", \"Miss Lizzie Tinkum\", \"Doc Payne\", and, of course, her \"Brother\", who was simultaneously both slow-witted and wise. She usually closed her monologues with the exit line, \"I love you so much it hurts!\" She also sang comic novelty songs and often danced with [[Grandpa Jones]].\n\nIn 1956, she made a paid appearance – $3,000, plus expenses – at the kickoff event of the first Alabama gubernatorial candidacy of segregationist [[George Wallace]]. She also appeared at an event kicking off his 1962 candidacy for governor.\n\n[[File:Minnie Pearl hat.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Hat on display at the [[National Museum of American History]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]\n\nPearl drew much of her comic material from her hometown of Centerville, which she called [[Grinders Switch]]. Grinders Switch was a community just outside Centerville that consisted of little more than a railroad switch. Those who knew her recognized that the characters were largely based on actual Centerville residents. So much traffic resulted from fans and tourists looking for Grinders Switch that the Hickman County Highway Department eventually changed the designation on the \"Grinders Switch\" road sign to \"Hickman Springs Road\".\n\nCannon portrayed Minnie Pearl for many years on television, first on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Ozark Jubilee]]'' in the late 1950s; then on the long-running television series ''[[Hee Haw]]'', both on [[CBS]] and the subsequent [[Television syndication|syndicated]] version. She made several appearances on [[NBC]]'s ''[[The Ford Show|The Ford Show, Starring Tennessee Ernie Ford]]''. She also appeared as a celebrity panelist on game shows such as ''[[Match Game]]'' in 1977 and 1978, and ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'' in 1980. Her last regular performances on national television were on [[Ralph Emery]]'s ''Nashville Now'' country-music talk show on the former [[Paramount Network|The Nashville Network (TNN)]] [[cable television|cable]] channel. With Emery, she performed in a weekly feature \"Let Minnie Steal Your Joke\" in the Minnie Pearl character, and read jokes submitted by viewers, with prizes for the best jokes.<ref name=HallofFame/>\n\nCannon made a [[cameo role|cameo]] appearance in the film ''[[Coal Miner's Daughter (film)|Coal Miner's Daughter]]'', appearing at the Opry as Minnie Pearl.\n\n===Family life===\n[[File:Acuff-Pearl Statue.JPG|thumb|right|A life-sized statue of Minnie Pearl sits on a pew alongside a statue of [[Roy Acuff]] in the lobby of [[Ryman Auditorium]].]]\nOn February 23, 1947, Colley married Henry R. Cannon, who had been an [[United States Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]] [[fighter pilot]] during [[World War II]] and was then a partner in an [[air charter]] service. After the wedding, Cannon set up his own air charter service for country music performers and took over management of the Minnie Pearl character.<ref name=HallofFame/><ref name=McCusker/> His clients in the charter service included [[Eddy Arnold]], [[Colonel Tom Parker]], [[Hank Williams]], [[Carl Smith (country musician)|Carl Smith]], [[Webb Pierce]], and [[Elvis Presley]].<ref name=HallofFame/> The couple had no children.<ref name=McCusker/> In 1969, they purchased a large estate home in Nashville next door to the [[Tennessee Governor's Mansion]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musiccitypearl.com/ |title=MusicCityPearl.com |access-date=2007-01-17 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929122022/http://www.musiccitypearl.com/ |archive-date=September 29, 2007 }}</ref> Cannon attended Brentwood Methodist Church, just to the south of Nashville, where she also donated the pipe organ.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bordsen|first=John|title=Nashville Country Here's Where The Music Stars Hang Their Hats|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/2000/12/24/nashville-country/|work=Dec. 24, 2000|date=24 December 2000 |access-date=May 23, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Chicken restaurants===\n{{see also|List of fast-food chicken restaurants}}\nIn the late 1960s, Nashville entrepreneur [[John Jay Hooker]] persuaded Cannon and [[gospel music|gospel]] singer [[Mahalia Jackson]] to lend their names to a [[Restaurant chain|chain]] of [[fried chicken restaurant]]s established to compete with [[Kentucky Fried Chicken]]. After initially reporting good results and enjoying a public stock worth $64 million, the venture collapsed amid allegations of accounting irregularities and stock price manipulation. The ensuing investigation by the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] cleared both Cannon and Jackson of involvement in financial wrongdoings, but both were embarrassed by the negative publicity.\n\n===Cancer research===\nAfter battling [[breast cancer]] through aggressive treatments, including a double [[mastectomy]] and [[radiation therapy]], she became a spokeswoman for the medical center in Nashville where she had been treated. She took on this role as herself, Sarah Ophelia Cannon, not Minnie Pearl, although a [[nonprofit]] group, the Minnie Pearl Cancer Foundation, was founded in her memory to help fund cancer research. The center where she was treated was later named the Sarah Cannon Cancer Center, and has been expanded to at least twenty other hospitals in [[Middle Tennessee]], southern Kentucky, Richmond, Virginia, Kansas City, Missouri, Gainesville, Florida, and the UK. Her name has also been lent to the affiliated [[Sarah Cannon Research Institute]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pearlpoint.org/about-us/our-story|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150916061918/https://www.pearlpoint.org/about-us/our-story|archive-date = 2015-09-16|title = Creating a More Confident Cancer Journey &#124; PearlPoint}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sarahcannon.com/|title=Expert Cancer Care Navigated Close to Home|website=Sarahcannon.com|access-date=January 9, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Final years===\nCannon suffered a debilitating [[stroke]] in June 1991,<ref name=HallofFame/> bringing her performing career to an end. After the stroke, she resided in a Nashville [[nursing home]], where she received frequent visits from music industry figures, including [[Chely Wright]], [[Vince Gill]], and [[Amy Grant]]. Her death on March 4, 1996, at the age of 83 was attributed to complications from another stroke. She is buried at Mount Hope Cemetery in [[Franklin, Tennessee]].\n\n==Legacy and influence==\nShe was an important influence on younger female [[country music]] singers and rural humorists such as [[Jerry Clower]], [[Jeff Foxworthy]], [[Bill Engvall]], [[Carl Hurley]], David L Cook, [[Chonda Pierce]], [[Ron White]], and [[Larry the Cable Guy]]. In 1992, she was awarded the [[National Medal of Arts]].
