By 2003, Proctor had signed to [[BNA Records]], releasing her debut single \"Days Like This\" that year. This song, which peaked at number 24 on the country charts, was the first of four singles from her 2004 debut album ''[[Where I Belong (Rachel Proctor album)|Where I Belong]]''. Proctor's only album for the label, it also produced her highest-charting single in the number 18 \"[[Me and Emily]]\". Although she has not charted a single since 2004, she has written singles for [[Jessica Simpson]] and [[Jesse Lee (singer)|Jesse Lee]]. Proctor has also had songs recorded by Blake Shelton, Gary Allan, Jana Kramer, Lauren Alaina, and Kenny Loggins. In March 2013 Rachel signed an exclusive songwriting agreement with Big Tractor Music Publishing.

When she was in grade school, she appeared in local productions of ''[[Annie (musical)|Annie]]'' and ''[[The Sound of Music]]''. By the time she was in junior high school, she had signed with a New York management company that also managed [[New Kids on the Block]].<ref name=\"about\">{{cite news |url=http://countrymusic.about.com/od/rachelproctor/a/blrproctorbio.htm |title=Rachel Proctor bio (page 1) |accessdate=June 5, 2008 |last=Fabian |first=Shelly |work=[[About.com]] |archive-date=January 20, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120065557/http://countrymusic.about.com/od/rachelproctor/a/blrproctorbio.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref> Proctor also competed on the television talent show ''[[Star Search]]'', and by the time she was eighteen, she had begun writing songs and performing in local bands as well.<ref name=\"about\"/> (One band in which she performed also included a then-unknown [[Blake Shelton]].)<ref name=\"about2\">{{cite web |url=http://countrymusic.about.com/od/rachelproctor/a/blrproctorbio_2.htm |title=Rachel Proctor bio (page 2) |accessdate=June 5, 2008 |last=Fabian |first=Shelly |work=About.com |archive-date=February 8, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208145052/http://countrymusic.about.com/od/rachelproctor/a/blrproctorbio_2.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nProctor moved to [[Nashville]], [[Tennessee]] in the mid 1990s in pursuit of a record deal.
