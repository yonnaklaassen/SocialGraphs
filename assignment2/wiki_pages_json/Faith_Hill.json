Next she achieved immense mainstream and [[Crossover (music)|crossover]] success with two albums, ''[[Faith (Faith Hill album)|Faith]]'' (1998) and ''[[Breathe (Faith Hill album)|Breathe]]'' (1999). ''Faith'' produced her first international hit, \"[[This Kiss (Faith Hill song)|This Kiss]]\", while her album ''Breathe'' became one of the best-selling country albums of all time. The album was led by the huge crossover success of the songs \"[[Breathe (Faith Hill song)|Breathe]]\" and \"[[The Way You Love Me (Faith Hill song)|The Way You Love Me]]\". ''Breathe'' saw massive sales worldwide and earned three [[Grammy Awards]].\n\nIn 2001, Hill recorded \"[[There You'll Be]]\" for the ''[[Pearl Harbor (film)|Pearl Harbor]]'' soundtrack and it too became an international success. Nominated for an [[Academy Award]], it remains her best-selling single in [[Europe]]. \n\nHill's next two albums, ''[[Cry (Faith Hill album)|Cry]]'' (2002) and ''[[Fireflies (Faith Hill album)|Fireflies]]'' (2005), continued her commercial successes; the former spawned another crossover single, \"[[Cry (Faith Hill song)|Cry]]\", which won Hill a Grammy, and the latter produced the singles \"[[Mississippi Girl]]\" and \"[[Like We Never Loved at All]]\", which earned additional Grammy Awards.\n\nHill has won five Grammy Awards, 15 [[Academy of Country Music Awards]], six [[American Music Awards]], and several other awards.
