She tells such wonderful stories and she’s so honest and she’s her. She makes fun of herself. She knows how to be silly and she knows how to be serious. She can lift people up after she’s told them a really heavy story. I think she’s just a really marvellous storyteller. She’s always been a big inspiration to me\". She also added that she \"loved the way [[Alison Krauss]] sings and the stories she tells\" and professes her love of [[Johnny Cash]] and [[June Carter Cash]], Australian pop star [[Tina Arena]] and musical theatre legend [[Stephen Sondheim]]. Bowen asserts that [[Buddy Miller]] is her \"ultimate music mentor\" as he is \"the one who taught [her] to use a microphone when [she] first got to Nashville\", adding that he and his wife [[Julie Miller|Julie]] \"make such beautiful music together\".<ref name=\"entertainment-focus.com\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Twitter}}\n* {{IMDb name}}\n* {{Discogs artist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bowen, Clare}}\n[[Category:1984 births]]\n[[Category:Australian country singers]]\n[[Category:Australian film actresses]]\n[[Category:Australian stage actresses]]\n[[Category:Australian television actresses]]\n[[Category:Australian expatriate actresses in the United States]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:University of Wollongong alumni]]\n[[Category:21st-century Australian actresses]]\n[[Category:21st-century Australian singers]]"
