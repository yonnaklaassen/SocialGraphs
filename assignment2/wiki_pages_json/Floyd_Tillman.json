Tillman was inducted into the [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 1970 and the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] in 1984.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nHe was born in [[Ryan, Oklahoma]], United States,<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> and grew up in the cotton-mill town of [[Post, Texas]] as a [[sharecropper]]'s son.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> One of his early jobs was with [[Western Union]] as a [[Telegraphy|telegraph]] operator. In the early 1930s, Tilman played mandolin and banjo at local dances and eventually took up the guitar.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/>\n\n===Musical career===\nTillman moved to [[San Antonio]] played lead guitar with [[Adolph Hofner]], a Western swing bandleader, and soon developed into a songwriter and singer.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> He took a job with [[Houston]] pop bandleader Mack Clark in 1938,<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> and played with Western swing groups fronted by Leon \"Pappy\" Selph and [[Cliff Bruner]]. He also worked with [[Ted Daffan]], and singer and piano player [[Moon Mullican]].\n\nTillman recorded as a featured vocalist with Selph's Blue Ridge Playboys in 1938, the same year Floyd scored his first major songwriting hit, \"It Makes No Difference Now\", giving him his own [[Decca Records|Decca]] recording contract.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> [[Jimmie Davis]] purchased the song from Floyd for $300, the co-rights to which he got back 28 years later.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2006-01-02|title=Floyd Tillman|url=http://www.nashvillesongwritersfoundation.com/fame/tillman.html|access-date=2021-08-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060102165438/http://www.nashvillesongwritersfoundation.com/fame/tillman.html|archive-date=2006-01-02}}</ref><ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/>\n\nTillman's only No. 1 one song as a singer was \"[[They Took the Stars Out of Heaven]]\".<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/>  It reached the top of the charts in 1944.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> Previously, he had reached No. 2 with \"I'm Gonna Change All My Ways\". His 1944 hit, \"Each Night At Nine\", struck a chord with lonely servicemen during [[World War II]]. [[Axis Sally]] and [[Tokyo Rose]] played it heavily to encourage desertion.\n\nA big hit for Tillman and also for [[Jimmy Wakely]] was 1948's \"[[I Love You So Much It Hurts]]\".<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> His 1949 \"[[Slippin' Around]]\", one of the first country western \"cheating\" songs, was a hit for Tillman as well as [[Ernest Tubb]], Texas Jim Robertson and the duo of [[Margaret Whiting]] and [[Jimmy Wakely]].<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> Tillman had another successful song with his own answer, \"[[I'll Never Slip Around Again]]\", as again did the Whiting-Wakely duo.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> He slowed down on his performing in the early 1950s, although he appeared on ABC-TV's ''[[Ozark Jubilee|Jubilee USA]]'' in 1958 and 1959.\n\nTillman's final album, recorded in 2002 and 2003 titled ''The Influence'', paired him with country music artists who were influenced by his style and performing: [[Willie Nelson]], [[Merle Haggard]], [[Leona Williams]], [[Dolly Parton]], Justin Trevino, [[Ray Price (musician)|Ray Price]], [[Frankie Miller (country musician)|Frankie Miller]], [[Hank Thompson (music)|Hank Thompson]], [[Connie Smith]], [[Lawton Williams]], [[Mel Tillis]], [[Darrell McCall]], [[Johnny Bush]] and [[George Jones]]. The project, released in April 2004, featured liner notes by Dr. [[Bill C. Malone|Bill Malone]], [[Bill Mack (singer)|Bill Mack]], [[Hank Thompson (music)|Hank Thompson]] and [[Willie Nelson]].  It was produced by Justin Trevino on Heart of Texas Records.\n\nHe was inducted into the [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 1970, and the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] in 1984.<ref name=\"Independent\"/>\n\nFloyd Tillman died in August 2003, at the age of 88.<ref name=\"Independent\"/>\n\n==Singles==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
