Lee Sowell''' (born July 8, 1947) is an American musician, pianist and composer. He spent much of his early years playing [[rockabilly]] piano in the late 1950s, playing [[Electronic organ|organ]] in [[rock and roll|rock-and-roll]] [[band (music)|bands]] in the 1960s and playing piano in numerous [[country music]] bands from the 1970s to the 1990s. He was a Mid-South Fair winner in 1966 and was inducted into the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]] in 2002. In 1994, he went out as a solo artist. As a pianist and composer, Sowell has recorded eight albums, crossing many genres of music, from [[jazz]], pop, [[rock and roll]], [[honky tonk]] and [[blues]] to [[country music]], [[gospel music|gospel]] and [[easy listening]].\n\nThe following Memphis musicians were all part of bands with Sowell from the 1960s to the 1990s:\nBarry Sowell ([[Amazing Rhythm Aces]]),\n[[Bobby Whitlock]] ([[Eric Clapton]], [[George Harrison]]),\nBill Humble ([[Elvis Presley]], [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]]),\nDanny Fitzgerald ([[Johnny Rodriguez]]),\nDavid Miller ([[Bill Black]], [[U2]]),\nEddie Slusser ([[Jerry Lee Lewis]], [[Hank Williams Jr.]]),\nFred Prouty ([[Charlie Rich]]),\nGlenn Childress ([[Lonestar]]),\nJack Holder ([[Black Oak Arkansas]]),\nJim Gammell ([[Eddie Bond]]),\nRobert Johnson ([[The Rolling Stones]], [[ZZ Top]]),\nRonnie Scaife ([[Neil Diamond]]), and [[Roy Yeager]] ([[The Crackerjacks (band)|Crackerjacks]], [[Lobo (musician)|Lobo]], [[Atlanta Rhythm Section]], [[Ronnie Milsap]]).\n\n==Biography==\nSowell was born in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], and was named after a famous [[Southern Baptist]] preacher, Dr. Robert G. Lee.\nWhen Sowell was drafted during the [[Vietnam War]], he dropped the initial and became Robert Lee Sowell. In music, his stage name has always been Bobby or Bobby Lee. Growing up in Memphis, Sowell had diverse musical influences. Early influences included [[Hank Williams]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Carl Perkins]] and [[Muddy Waters]]. But what really got his attention were the piano players of that day, [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], [[Fats Domino]], [[Ray Charles]], [[Roger Williams (pianist)|Roger Williams]] and [[Floyd Cramer]]. When Sowell was 16, he met Cramer, and the experience had a lasting effect on his music. His father played harmonica and piano by ear, and his mother sang and played the guitar; she sang on the radio in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]], in the 1940s. They used to have regular family singalongs, inviting area musicians to join in. Early rock and roll along with [[rockabilly]], honkytonk, blues, gospel and his mother's country music had an influence on Sowell's creativity and can be heard in his music style throughout his career.\n\n==Early life==\nAbout the time Sowell was 12 years old, honkytonk and rockabilly music were thriving in Memphis, and he started playing in bars and [[nightclubs]] with much older musicians. They used to sneak him in the back door and hide him behind an upright piano where no one could see how young he was. Sowell also played a lot of sock hops. He joined his first band, the Red Notes, an [[instrumental]] group, in 1959. His parents' house hosted many [[jam sessions]] for area musicians. Many successful professional musicians have come out of Frayser suburb of Memphis, and Sowell has picked with most of them.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:BobbyLV72.jpg|thumb|right|Las Vegas 1972]] -->\nAround the age of 16 the [[British Invasion]] meant Sowell had to adapt to a new kind of music, in which the organ was a more prominent instrument than the piano. Sowell played in numerous groups in the 1960s. In 1966 he won the [[Mid-South Fair]] and was scheduled to appear on ''[[Ted Mack (radio-TV host)|Ted Mack]] and the Original Amateur Hour'' on [[CBS]] Television, but before he could go there, he was drafted and served in the [[Vietnam War]], and his music career was put on hold, although he played while in the military, NCO and Officers Clubs, winning talent shows. After the war and a bout with alcoholism, Sowell got back on the right track. He returned to his first love, the piano, playing and recording in an easy-listening style.\n\n==Later life==\n\nBobby Sowell has been performing music professionally from 1959 to the present day. In 2010, he formed a new blues band, Coldwater Revival (CWR). He is actively performing solo gigs or with the band, recording new music.\n\n==Discography==\n*''Natural High'' (1996)\n*''Country Gold Tribute'' (1999)\n*''Falling Waters'' (2014)\n*''a Tendre Merci'' (2015)\n*''Ricky's Got The Blues'' (2015)\n*''Many Colors of Tennessee'' (2016)\n*''A Simpler Life'' (2017)\n*''Sleepy bubbles'' (2017)\n*''Keep In Touch'' (2017)\n*''Oh Me, Oh My'' (2017)\n*''Let There Be Light' (2017)\n\n==Selected reading==\n* ''Bobby Sowell Rockabilly Biography:'' Bob Timmers (2002)\n* ''The Memphis garage rock yearbook, 1960-1975''  Ron Hall (2003), {{ISBN|978-0966857528}}\n* ''Memphis Blues Musicians: Amazon.com'' (2010)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*https://web.archive.org/web/20190518131612/http://www.rockabillyhall.com/Certificates.html  \"Rockabilly Hall of Fame\"]\n*[http://www.rockabillyhall.com/Certificates.html \"Induction Certificate\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190518131612/http://www.rockabillyhall.com/Certificates.html |date=May 18, 2019 }}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sowell, Bobby}}\n[[Category:1947 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:American country pianists]]\n[[Category:American country rock singers]]\n[[Category:American country singer-songwriters]]\n[[Category:Memphis blues musicians]]\n[[Category:American rockabilly musicians]]\n[[Category:American blues pianists]]\n[[Category:American male pianists]]\n[[Category:American blues singers]]\n[[Category:Musicians from Memphis, Tennessee]]\n[[Category:Singer-songwriters from Tennessee]]\n[[Category:Southern Baptists]]\n[[Category:20th-century American pianists]]\n[[Category:Baptists from Tennessee]]\n[[Category:Country musicians from Tennessee]]\n[[Category:21st-century American pianists]]\n[[Category:20th-century American male musicians]]\n[[Category:21st-century American male musicians]]\n[[Category:American male singer-songwriters]]"
