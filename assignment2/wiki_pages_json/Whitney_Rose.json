Rose (1947–2015),<ref name=\":3\" /> in [[Charlottetown]], the capital of Prince Edward Island, where she lived in a home with her mother's younger brothers and sisters. Her grandparents ran a bar called the Union Hall. Rose's favorite song from the age of two was [[Hank Williams]]’ \"[[There's a Tear in My Beer]]\", which she'd sing to bar customers – sometimes crawling downstairs after her bedtime, and sometimes being paid a dollar to sing. As she jokes, \"I guess it became my career pretty early on. And the pay is about the same now, too. Not much has changed.\"<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nHer grandfather's \"song of choice\" was the [[Johnny Cash]] classic \"[[Ring of Fire (song)|Ring of Fire]]\", which she often includes in her set lists in his memory. As an 8-year-old, Rose made a road trip with her mother to [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]] where she saw [[The Rankin Family]], a regional group that mixed [[Celtic music|Celtic]] and country sounds. It was her first big concert. She plays the group's music on the tour bus \"because nobody really outside of the (Canadian) East Coast has even heard of them. . . I don't think it's solely nostalgia. I actually enjoy the music, too.\"<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nRose attended five different colleges, studying journalism and majoring in English. A \"starter guitar\" given to her by her Uncle Dan started her writing songs. Moving to Toronto from \"a farm in the middle of nowhere in Nova Scotia\", and a failed relationship, she'd written enough songs for a record. In Toronto she got \"immersed\" in the Cameron House scene, the bar becoming a second home. She released her self-titled debut record in 2012 for fledgling Cameron House Records.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nShe got signed by \"great booking agents\" in 2013 and made a \"one-off appearance\" opening for U.S. country act [[The Mavericks]] in Toronto. She later toured as an opening act for [[Raul Malo]]’s band. Rose received a Gibson acoustic guitar, which she named \"Aggie\", as a 27th-birthday present from a boyfriend in 2013. Rose says of the instrument, \"I always kind of meant it to be just a writing tool. ... It's kind of one of the biggest surprises of my life that I actually play guitar in front of people night after night because at one point it would have been absolutely my worst nightmare.\"<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nShe signed with Six Shooter Records in 2016 and is managed by Michael McKeown, former president of Cameron House Records.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Recordings==\n[[File:Whitney Rose at NXNE in 2014 (14476512362) (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Rose at NXNE in 2014]]\nRose signed originally with Cameron House Records, an \"offshoot of the legendary Toronto club\" of the same name.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Hatfield |first=Erin |title=Debut CD for Parkdale songstress Whitney Rose filled with veteran talent |url=https://www.toronto.com/news/debut-cd-for-parkdale-songstress-whitney-rose-filled-with-veteran-talent/article_65cd336e-ad81-5f6c-bb0c-49b6d80712d4.html |access-date=2022-03-26 |website=Toronto |date=October 31, 2012 |language=en |archive-date=April 18, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230418023354/https://www.toronto.com/news/debut-cd-for-parkdale-songstress-whitney-rose-filled-with-veteran-talent/article_65cd336e-ad81-5f6c-bb0c-49b6d80712d4.html |url-status=live }}</ref> She joined other artists on the label, e.g., [[Al Tuck]], [[Doug Paisley]], [[Devin Cuddy|The Devin Cuddy Band]], Sam Cash & The Romantic Dogs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cameronhouserecords.com/gallery/whitney-rose/|title=Whitney Rose {{!}} Cameron House Records|website=Cameronhouserecords.com|access-date=August 10, 2017|archive-date=August 11, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170811010039/http://www.cameronhouserecords.com/gallery/whitney-rose/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== ''Heartbreaker of the Year (2015)'' ===\nRose's sophomore release was produced by The Mavericks' frontman, Raul Malo, and includes two covers: [[Hank Williams]]’ \"[[There's a Tear in My Beer]]\" and \"[[Be My Baby (Vanessa Paradis song)|Be My Baby]]\" by the [[The Ronettes|Ronettes]].
