His early career as a backup vocalist included a long stint with singer/songwriter [[Marty Robbins]].  Shortly before beginning his solo recording career he had two major hits as songwriter in 1964, the top 5 \"What Does it Take\" which was recorded by [[Skeeter Davis]] and the top 40 \"Thanks a Lot for Tryin' Anyway\" recorded by [[Liz Anderson]] and later covered in albums by [[Jan Howard]] and [[Connie Smith]]. His biggest songwriting success was \"[[Woman, Woman]]\" a number 4 pop hit recorded by [[Gary Puckett & The Union Gap]] in 1967, and charting again for Glaser himself in 1975.\n\nAs a solo artist, Jim Glaser recorded four studio albums, and charted several singles on the [[Hot Country Songs]] charts, including the Number One hit \"[[You're Gettin' to Me Again]]\".<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> Out of his three brothers, he was the only one to have a Number One hit. He was selected by the [[Academy of Country Music]] as [[Academy of Country Music Award for New Male Artist of the Year|Best New Male Vocalist]] in 1984. In 1979 he recorded the first version of the song \"Who Were You Thinkin' Of,\" which he co-wrote with [[Cathie Pelletier]] and Paul Gauvin; it was later recorded by [[The Texas Tornados]], among others.<ref>{{cite web|website=SecondHandSongs|url=https://secondhandsongs.com/work/127192/all|title=Who Were You Thinkin' Of|accessdate=July 11, 2022}}</ref>\n\nGlaser died of a heart attack on April 6, 2019, at the age of 81.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://musicrow.com/2019/04/tompall-the-glaser-brothers-member-jim-glaser-dies/|title=Tompall & The Glaser Brothers Member Jim Glaser Dies|date=April 8, 2019|website=Musicrow.com|accessdate=April 9, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n;Studio albums\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!rowspan=\"2\"| Year\n!rowspan=\"2\"| Title\n!colspan=\"1\"| Chart Positions\n!rowspan=\"2\"| Label\n|-\n!width=\"60\"| <small>[[Top Country Albums|US Country]]</small>\n|- \n|1983\n|''Man in the Mirror''\n|align=center|16\n|rowspan=3|Noble Vision\n|-\n|1984\n|''Past the Point of No Return''\n|align=center|40\n|-\n|1985\n|''Everybody Knows I'm Yours''\n|align=center|49\n|-\n|2004\n|''Me and My Dream''\n|\n|Solitaire\n|}\n\n===Singles===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!rowspan=\"2\"| Year\n!rowspan=\"2\"| Song\n!colspan=\"2\"| Chart Positions\n!rowspan=\"2\"| Album\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n!width=\"50\"| [[Hot Country Songs|US Country]]\n!width=\"50\"| CAN Country\n|-\n|1968\n|\"God Help You Woman\"\n|align=center|32\n|align=center|24\n|rowspan=12|singles only\n|-\n|rowspan=3|1969\n|\"Please Take Me Back\"\n|align=center|40\n|align=center|—\n|-\n|\"I'm Not Through Loving You\"\n|align=center|52\n|align=center|—\n|-\n|\"Molly\"\n|align=center|53\n|align=center|—\n|-\n|1973\n|\"I See His Love All Over You\"\n|align=center|67\n|align=center|—\n|-\n|rowspan=2|1974\n|\"Fool Passin' Through\"\n|align=center|68\n|align=center|—\n|-\n|\"Forgettin' 'Bout You\"\n|align=center|51\n|align=center|—\n|-\n|rowspan=2|1975\n|\"One, Two, Three (Never Gonna Fall in Love Again)\"\n|align=center|88\n|align=center|—\n|-\n|\"[[Woman, Woman]]\"\n|align=center|43\n|align=center|46\n|-\n|1976\n|\"She's Free But She's Not Easy\"\n|align=center|66\n|align=center|—\n|-\n|rowspan=2|1977\n|\"Chasin' My Tail\"\n|align=center|88\n|align=center|—\n|-\n|\"Don't Let My Love Stand in Your Way\"\n|align=center|86\n|align=center|—\n|-\n|rowspan=3|1983\n|\"When You're Not a Lady\"\n|align=center|16\n|align=center|—\n|rowspan=6|''The Man in the Mirror''\n|-\n|\"You Got Me Running\"\n|align=center|28\n|align=center|—\n|-\n|\"The Man in the Mirror\"\n|align=center|17\n|align=center|—\n|-\n|rowspan=3|1984\n|\"[[If I Could Only Dance with You]]\"\n|align=center|10\n|align=center|10\n|-\n|\"[[You're Gettin' to Me Again]]\"\n|align=center|1\n|align=center|3\n|-\n|\"Let Me Down Easy\"\n|align=center|16\n|align=center|33\n|-\n|rowspan=2|1985\n|\"I'll Be Your Fool Tonight\"\n|align=center|54\n|align=center|—\n|rowspan=3|''Past the Point of No Return''\n|-\n|\"In Another Minute\"\n|align=center|27\n|align=center|—\n|-\n|rowspan=2|1986\n|\"If I Don't Love You\"\n|align=center|53\n|align=center|—\n|-\n|\"The Lights of Albuquerque\"\n|align=center|40\n|align=center|—\n|''Everybody Knows I'm Yours''\n|}\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year\n!Organization\n!Award\n!Nominee/Work\n!Result\n|-\n|1984\n|[[Academy of Country Music Awards]]\n|[[Academy of Country Music Award for New Male Artist of the Year|Top New Male Vocalist]]\n|Jim Glaser\n|{{won}}\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Glaser, Jim}}\n[[Category:1937 births]]\n[[Category:2019 deaths]]\n[[Category:American country guitarists]]\n[[Category:American country singer-songwriters]]\n[[Category:MCA Records artists]]\n[[Category:People from Spalding, Nebraska]]\n[[Category:Country musicians from Nebraska]]\n[[Category:Singer-songwriters from Nebraska]]\n\n\n{{US-country-singer-stub}}"
