Through her parents' efforts, Rimes began performing in various musical theater and local music contests. Working with her father as producer and manager, Rimes recorded two studio albums as a preteen. She developed a local following that helped bring her to the attention of Nashville label [[Curb Records]]. In 1996, aged 13, she signed a contract with Curb and released the single \"[[Blue (Bill Mack song)#LeAnn Rimes versions|Blue]]\", which became a top-10 hit on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country songs chart. Her 1996 [[Blue (LeAnn Rimes album)|album of the same name]] was [[RIAA certification|certified Platinum]] six times and established her as a major country artist. In 1997, Rimes crossed over into pop music with \"[[How Do I Live]]\", which became one of the best-selling singles of the 1990s. The track was included on her next album ''[[You Light Up My Life: Inspirational Songs]]'' (1997), which was certified quadruple Platinum. It was followed up with the Platinum-certified albums ''[[Sittin' on Top of the World (LeAnn Rimes album)|Sittin' on Top of the World]]'' (1998) and ''[[LeAnn Rimes (album)|LeAnn Rimes]]'' (1999). In the following years, Rimes released several pop singles for soundtrack albums, which include \"[[I Need You (LeAnn Rimes song)|I Need You]]\" and \"[[Can't Fight the Moonlight]]\", the latter of which became a major hit worldwide. Several of these soundtrack singles were compiled on the Platinum-certified album ''[[I Need You (LeAnn Rimes album)|I Need You]]'' (2001).\n\nBreaking away from her father's management in the 2000s, Rimes released the Gold-certified pop album ''[[Twisted Angel]]'' (2002) and the Christmas record ''[[What a Wonderful World (LeAnn Rimes album)|What a Wonderful World]]'' (2004). She returned to her country origins with ''[[This Woman (LeAnn Rimes album)|This Woman]]'' (2005), which produced three country hits and was certified Gold. Later album releases were ''[[Whatever We Wanna]]'' (2006), ''[[Family (LeAnn Rimes album)|Family]]'' (2007), ''[[Lady & Gentlemen]]'' (2011), and ''[[Spitfire (LeAnn Rimes album)|Spitfire]]'' (2013). After ending her long-time professional relationship with Curb Records, Rimes released the Christmas album ''[[Today Is Christmas]]'' (2015) and pop studio album ''[[Remnants (LeAnn Rimes album)|Remnants]]'' (2016), the latter of which featured two number one ''Billboard'' dance club hits. In the years that followed, she released the albums ''[[Chant: The Human & the Holy]]'' (2020) and ''[[God's Work]]'' (2022).  \n\nRimes has also had several notable television film roles. She began her acting career with the film ''[[Holiday in Your Heart]]'' (1997). After appearing in the television film ''[[Northern Lights (2009 film)|Northern Lights]]'' (2009), Rimes began an affair with co-star [[Eddie Cibrian]] which received notable media attention.
