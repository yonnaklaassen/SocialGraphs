Daniels was constantly surrounded by music and singing. She was introduced to music at an early age by a grandfather who taught her how to yodel and an uncle who schooled her in classic rock. She began to write songs at age 12 preferring music that incorporated a country pop music sound.\n\nDaniels began performing as a young girl in choirs and singing competitions. Her first exposure to country music came at age 10 singing at the CNE Open Country singing contest. While attending school in [[Uxbridge, Ontario]] Leah began to perform in musicals. She performed roles as Eliza Doolittle in \"[[My Fair Lady]]\", Sandy in \"[[Grease (musical)|Grease]]\" and Anita in \"[[West Side Story]]\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Boyce|first= Conrad|title=When Did They Grow Up?|newspaper= Uxbridge Cosmos|date= February 28, 2008}}</ref> Her first professional singing job was at a dinner theatre called, \"Al Capone’s Birthday\".
