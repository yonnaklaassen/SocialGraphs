His break came in 1973 thanks to Commander Cody of [[Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen]], who contacted Vanguard Music on his behalf. Friedman released ''Kinky Friedman'' in 1974 for [[ABC Records]], then toured with [[Bob Dylan]] in 1975–1976.<ref>Tucker, Stephen R. (1998). \"Kinky Friedman\". In ''The Encyclopedia of Country Music''. Paul Kingsbury, Editor. New York: Oxford University Press. p. 184.</ref> His repertoire mixed [[social commentary]] (\"We Reserve the Right to Refuse Service to You\") and maudlin ballads (\"Western Union Wire\") with raucous humor (such as \"Get Your Biscuits in the Oven and Your Buns in the Bed\"). His \"Ride 'Em Jewboy\" was an extended tribute to the victims of [[the Holocaust]].\n\nOne of his most famous songs is \"They Ain't Makin' Jews Like Jesus Anymore,\" a song in which Kinky verbally and physically beats up a drunken white racist who berates blacks, Jews, Italians, Greeks, and [[Sigma Nu]]s in a bar, with lyrics such as,\n\n<blockquote><poem>\nOh, they ain't makin' Jews like Jesus anymore,\nThey ain't makin' carpenters that know what nails are for\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nOther Friedman tunes include \"The Ballad of Charles Whitman,\" in which Friedman lampooned [[Charles Whitman]]'s [[University of Texas tower shooting|sniper attack]] from the [[University of Texas at Austin]]'s [[Main Building (University of Texas at Austin)|Main Building tower]] on August 1, 1966. He also covered [[Chinga Chavin]]'s \"Asshole from [[El Paso]]\", a parody of [[Merle Haggard]]'s \"[[Okie from Muskogee (song)|Okie from Muskogee]]\".\n\nOne of Friedman's most infamous concerts was a 1973 performance in [[Buffalo, New York]]; upon performing \"Get Your Biscuits in the Oven and Your Buns in the Bed\" (a song that lampoons [[feminism]]), a group of what Friedman described as \"cranked-up lesbians\" entered into a fight with the band and forced the concert to end early while Friedman and the band were escorted off stage. The [[National Organization for Women]] awarded Friedman the \"Male Chauvinist Pig Award\" later that year, an award Friedman took with pride.
