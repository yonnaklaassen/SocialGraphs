A former [[police officer]] and bull rider, Ward signed to [[Giant Records (Warner)|Giant Records]] in 1994.

Written by [[Robert Ellis Orrall]] and [[Josh Leo]], and originally recorded by Orrall in the duo [[Orrall & Wright]], the song received a favorable review from ''Billboard'', whose Deborah Evans Price said that it \"should go a long way toward helping Ward get through the clutter of competition at country radio.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Price|first=Deborah Evans|date=10 August 1996|title=Reviews|magazine=Billboard|page=41|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wgcEAAAAMBAJ&dq=%22chris+ward%22+%22Fall+reaching%22&pg=PA47-IA6}}</ref> The song spent two weeks on the [[Hot Country Songs]] charts, peaking at number 68.<ref name=\"whitburn\">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2008|publisher=Record Research, Inc|year=2008|page=446|isbn=978-0-89820-177-2}}</ref>\n\nStroud and [[Dann Huff]] co-produced Ward's debut album ''One Step Beyond''.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Flippo|first=Chet|date=29 June 1996|title=Giant's Chris Ward traded his police badge for singing career|magazine=Billboard|pages=28, 30|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pgkEAAAAMBAJ&dq=%22chris+ward%22+%22Fall+reaching%22&pg=PA28}}</ref> This album included the song \"[[Only God (Could Stop Me Loving You)]]\", co-written by [[Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange]].
