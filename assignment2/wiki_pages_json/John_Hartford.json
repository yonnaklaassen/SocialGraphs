He spent his childhood in [[St.&nbsp;Louis, Missouri]], where he was exposed to the influence that shaped much of his career and music: the Mississippi River. From the time he got his first job on the river, at age 16, Hartford was on, around, or singing about the river.\n\nHis early musical influences came from the broadcasts of the [[Grand Ole Opry]] and included [[Earl Scruggs]], nominal inventor of the three-finger bluegrass style of [[banjo]] playing. Hartford said often that the first time he heard Earl Scruggs pick the banjo, it changed his life. By age 13, Hartford was an accomplished old-time [[fiddle]]r and banjo player, and he soon learned to play guitar and [[mandolin]] as well. Hartford performed with his first bluegrass band while attending [[John Burroughs School]], a local private high school.\n\nAfter high school, he enrolled at [[Washington University in St. Louis]], completed four years of a commercial arts program and dropped out to focus on music; however, he did receive a degree in 1960. He immersed himself in the local music scene, working as a DJ, playing in bands, and occasionally recording singles for local labels.\n\n==Music career==\n[[File:Helix, v.4, no.2, Jul. 18, 1968 - DPLA - 451625779b905df3f6c596ed3f34bf66 (page 9).jpg|thumb|upright|left|Full-page ad for the 1968 album ''Housing Project''.]]\nIn 1965, he moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], the center of the country music industry. In 1966, he signed with [[RCA Victor]] and produced his first album, ''[[Looks at Life]]'', in the same year.<ref>{{cite book |last=Samuelson |first=Dave |year=2012 |title=The Encyclopedia of Country Music |editor1-first=Michael |editor1-last=McCall |editor2-first=John |editor2-last=Rumble |editor3-first=Paul |editor3-last=Kingsbury |location=New York |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |page=215 |isbn=978-0195395631}}</ref>\n\nIn 1967, Hartford's second album ''[[Earthwords & Music]]'' spawned his first major songwriting hit, \"[[Gentle on My Mind]]\".<ref name=\"ig.ft.com\">{{cite web | url=https://ig.ft.com/life-of-a-song/gentle-on-my-mind.html | title=Subscribe to the Financial Times | date=September 21, 2023 }}</ref> His recording of the song was only a modest success, but it caught the notice of [[Glen Campbell]], who recorded his own version, which gave the song much wider publication. At the [[10th Annual Grammy Awards|1968 Grammys]], the song netted four awards, two of which went to Hartford. It became one of the most widely recorded country songs of all time, and the royalties it brought in allowed Hartford great financial independence; Hartford later said that the song bought his freedom.<ref name=\"biography\">Hartford's [http://www.johnhartford.com/biography.cfm biography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060206021252/http://www.johnhartford.com/biography.cfm |date=February 6, 2006 }} from his official site.</ref>\n\nAs his popularity grew, he moved to the West Coast, where he became a regular on ''[[The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]]''; other television appearances followed, as did recording appearances with several major country artists. Hartford played banjo and sang the vocal harmonies on the Guthrie Thomas song \"I'll be Lucky\". He also played with [[The Byrds]] on their album ''[[Sweetheart of the Rodeo]]''.\n\nHis success on the Smothers Brothers series was enough that Hartford was offered the lead role in a TV detective series, but he turned it down to move back to Nashville and concentrate on music. He also was a regular on ''[[The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour]]''<ref name=\"AMG\" /> (as the banjo picker who would stand up from his seat in the audience to begin the theme music) and ''[[The Johnny Cash Show]]''.\n\nIn live performances, John Hartford was a true [[one-man band]]; he used several stringed instruments and a variety of props such as plywood squares and boards with sand and gravel for flatfoot dancing.\n\n===Newgrass===\nHartford recorded four more albums for RCA from 1968 to 1970: ''[[The Love Album (John Hartford album)|The Love Album]]'', ''[[Housing Project (album)|Housing Project]]'', ''[[John Hartford (album)|John Hartford]]'', and ''[[Iron Mountain Depot]]''. In 1971, he moved to [[Warner Bros. Records]], where he was given more freedom to record in his nontraditional style, fronting a band that included [[Vassar Clements]], [[Tut Taylor]], and [[Norman Blake (American musician)|Norman Blake]]. He recorded several albums that set the tone of his later career, including ''[[Aereo-Plain]]'' and ''[[Morning Bugle]]''. [[Sam Bush]] said, \"Without ''Aereo-Plain'' (and the Aereo-Plain band), there would be no newgrass music.\"<ref name=\"biography\"/>\n\nHe switched to the [[Flying Fish Records|Flying Fish]] label several years later and continued to experiment with nontraditional country and bluegrass styles. Among his recordings were two albums in 1977 and 1980 with Doug and Rodney Dillard from [[The Dillards]], with Sam Bush as a backing musician and featuring a diversity of songs that included \"[[Boogie On Reggae Woman]]\" and \"[[Yakety Yak]]\".<ref>[http://www.rounder.com/?id=album.php&catalog_id=5894 Dillard/Hartford/Dillard: Glitter Grass/Permanent Wave], [[Rounder Records]].</ref> Hartford's Grammy-winning ''[[Mark Twang]]'' features Hartford playing solo, reminiscent of his live solo performances playing the fiddle, guitar, banjo, and amplified plywood for tapping his feet. At the same time, he developed a stage show, which toured in various forms from the mid 1970s until shortly before his death.<ref name=\"AMG\" />\n\nHartford changed recording labels several more times during his career; in 1991, he inaugurated his own Small Dog a'Barkin' label. Later in the 1990s, he switched again to [[Rounder Records]]. He recorded a number of idiosyncratic records on Rounder, many of which recalled earlier forms of folk and country music. Among them was the 1999 album ''Retrograss'' recorded with [[Mike Seeger]] and [[David Grisman]], with bluegrass versions of \"[[(Sittin' on) the Dock of the Bay]]\", \"[[Maybellene]]\", \"[[When I'm Sixty-Four]]\", and \"[[Maggie's Farm]]\".\n\nHe recorded several songs for the [[O Brother, Where Art Thou? (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] to the movie ''[[O Brother, Where Art Thou?]]'', winning another Grammy for his performance. He made his final tour in 2000 with the [[Down from the Mountain]] tour that grew out of that movie and its accompanying album. While performing in Texas in April, he found that he could no longer control his hands due to [[non-Hodgkin lymphoma]], which ended his life two months later.\n\nHartford is considered a co-founder of the newgrass movement, although he remained deeply attached to traditional music as well. His last band and last few albums reflect his love for pre-bluegrass old-time music.\n\n==Steamboating==\nThe culture of the Mississippi River and its steamboats captivated Hartford from an early age. He said that it would have been his life's work \"but music got in the way\", so he intertwined them whenever possible. In the '70s, Hartford earned his steamboat pilot's license, which he used to keep close to the river he loved; for many years, he worked as a pilot on the [[riverboat|steamboat]] ''[[Julia Belle Swain]]'' during the summers. He also worked as a [[towboat]] pilot on the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]], [[Illinois River|Illinois]], and [[Tennessee River|Tennessee]] Rivers.\n\nDuring his later years, he came back to the river every summer. \"Working as a pilot is a labor of love\", he said. \"After a while, it becomes a metaphor for a whole lot of things, and I find for some mysterious reason that if I stay in touch with it, things seem to work out all right\". His home in [[Madison, Tennessee]], was situated on a bend of the Cumberland River and built to simulate the view from a steamboat deck. He used to talk to the boat captains by radio as their barges crawled along the river. That bend of the Cumberland River, known as \"Hartford's Bend\" or \"John Hartford Point\",<ref>Dansby, Andrew.

Along with his own compositions, such as \"Long Hot Summer Days\" and \"Kentucky Pool\", Hartford was a repository of old river songs, calls, and stories. His song \"Let Him Go on Mama\" from [[Mark Twang]] was inspired by retired [[Streckfus Steamers]] musician (and later chief engineer of the [[Delta Queen]]) Mike O'Leary.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The River: 'Geetars and mouth harps' were part of the river journey, and then there was also John Hartford {{!}} NKyTribune |date=May 10, 2020 |url=https://www.nkytribune.com/2020/05/the-river-geetars-and-mouth-harps-were-part-of-the-river-journey-and-then-there-was-also-john-hartford/ |access-date=2022-12-04 |language=en-US}}</ref> Hartford was also the author of ''[[Steamboat in a Cornfield]]'', a children's book that recounts the true story of the [[Ohio River]] steamboat ''The Virginia'' and its beaching in a cornfield.\n\n==Final years and legacy==\nBetween 1995 and 2001, Brandon Ray Kirk and he co-authored a biography of blind fiddler [[Ed Haley]].

Hartford's albums also vary widely in formality, from the stately and orderly ''Annual Waltz'' to the rougher and less cut recordings that typified many of his later albums.\n\n''[[Aereo-Plain]]'' and ''[[Morning Bugle]]'' are often considered to be Hartford's most influential works, coming as they did at the beginning of a period in which artists such as Hartford and the [[New Grass Revival]], led by Sam Bush, would create a new form of [[country music]], blending their country backgrounds with influences from a number of other sources. His later years had a number of live albums, as well as recordings that explored the repertoire of old-time [[folk music]]. He sketched the cover art for some of his midcareer albums, drawing with both hands simultaneously.\n\nHartford is also a published author, including 1971's collection of poetry ''Word Movies''<ref>{{cite book|title=Word Movies|url=https://www.amazon.com/Word-movies-John-Hartford/dp/B0006C5H78|date=January 1, 1971|publisher=Doubleday|first=John|last=Hartford}}</ref> and 1986's ''Steamboat in a Cornfield,''<ref>{{cite book|title=Steamboat in a Cornfield|date=1986|publisher=Doubleday|first=John|last=Hartford|isbn=0517561417 }}</ref> a poetic retelling of a steamboat running aground along the [[Ohio River]].<ref>{{cite news|title=The Steamer Virginia\n|url=https://www.waterwaysjournal.net/2019/03/29/the-steamer-virginia/#:~:text=Regarded%20as%20one%20of%20the,night%20of%20March%206%2C%201910|date=March 29, 2019|publisher=The Waterways Journal Weekly|first=Keith|last=Norrington}}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nHis song \"This Eve of Parting\", from the 1968 album ''[[The Love Album (John Hartford album)|The Love Album]]'', was featured in the 2017 movie ''[[Lady Bird (film)|Lady Bird]]'', portions being heard at two different points in the film.\n\nCartoonist [[Jim Scancarelli]] was a fan, and mentioned Hartford several times in his strip ''[[Gasoline Alley (comic strip)|Gasoline Alley]]''.
