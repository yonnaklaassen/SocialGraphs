Graham Brown''', is an American [[country music]] singer. Active since 1973, Brown has recorded a total of thirteen studio albums, and has charted more than twenty singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] chart. Three of these singles — \"[[Hell and High Water (T. Graham Brown song)|Hell and High Water]]\" and \"[[Don't Go to Strangers (T. Graham Brown song)|Don't Go to Strangers]]\" from 1986, and \"[[Darlene (T. Graham Brown song)|Darlene]]\" from 1988 — reached Number One, and eight more made Top Ten.\n\nIn 2024, he achieved one of country music's crowning achievements when he was invited to become a [[List of Grand Ole Opry members|member]] of the [[Grand Ole Opry]]. Prior to his induction, Brown had made over 300 appearances as a guest performer.\n\n==Biography==\nAnthony Graham Brown was born in 1954 in [[Arabi, Georgia]].<ref name=\"The Albany Journal\">{{cite web|url=http://thealbanyjournal.com/2011/08/t-graham-brown-the-interview/|work=The Albany Journal|title=T.

Brown also found work as a songwriter for E.M.I. Publishing before signing to [[Capitol Records]] in 1984. He was with [[Universal Music Group Nashville]] for 13 years. His first release for the label, \"Drowning in Memories\", peaked at No.39 on the Billboard country chart. The title song of his debut album \"I Tell It Like It Used To Be\" went to No.7, followed by \"I Wish That I Could Hurt That Way Again\" to No.4, giving way to a pair of number ones: \"Hell and High Water\" and \"Don't Go To Strangers\".<ref name=\"whitburn\"/>\n\nBrown's first release for the label, \"Drowning in Memories\", peaked at No.&nbsp;39 and was never included on an album. Next came the No.&nbsp;7 \"I Tell It Like It Used to Be\", the first single from his 1986 album of the same name. Counting its title track, this album accounted for four singles: the No.&nbsp;3 \"I Wish That I Could Hurt That Way Again\" and two straight Number Ones in \"Hell and High Water\" and \"Don't Go to Strangers\".<ref name=\"Larkin80\"/>\n\nBrown's second album for the label, ''Brilliant Conversationalist'', followed a year later. Although none of its singles went to Number One, it accounted for three more Top Ten hits in its title track, followed by \"She Couldn't Love Me Anymore\" and \"Last Resort\".<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p1537|pure_url=yes}}|title=allmusic (((T.

In early 1990, he sang guest vocals on the multi-artist charity single \"Tomorrow's World\", as well as [[Tanya Tucker]]'s single \"Don't Go Out\", from her album ''[[Tennessee Woman]]''.\n\n1990 also saw the release of his next album, ''Bumper to Bumper''. This album's lead-off single \"If You Could Only See Me Now\" went Top Ten with a No.&nbsp;6 peak, but the other singles — the No.&nbsp;18 \"Moonshadow Road\" and No.&nbsp;53 \"I'm Sending One Up for You\" — did not fare as well, with the latter being his first single to land outside the Top 40. That same year, he also released an unsuccessful greatest-hits package. His next album, ''You Can't Take It with You'', only accounted for the No.&nbsp;31 \"With This Ring\" before he exited Capitol in 1991.\n\nBrown did not record another album until 1998's ''Wine into Water'' on the Intersound label. This album produced four more singles for him, although the No.&nbsp;44 title track was the highest-charting single from it. The subject matter of the lyrics of the song surrounded Brown's then ongoing fight against alcoholism.<ref name=\"Larkin80\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Eighties Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=2003|edition=Third|isbn=1-85227-969-9|page=87}}</ref> He then released two more independent albums: ''The Next Right Thing'' in 2003 and ''The Present'' in 2006.\n\nBrown joined Broadway icon [[Carol Channing]] for a duet of \"[[Don't Sit Under The Apple Tree]]\" on her 2012 album ''True To The Red, White, and Blue''.
