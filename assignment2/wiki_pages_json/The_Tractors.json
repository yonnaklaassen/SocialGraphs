The original lineup consisted of Steve Ripley (lead vocals, guitar), Ron Getman (guitar, [[Dobro]], [[mandolin]], tenor vocals), Walt Richmond (keyboards, piano, bass vocals), Casey van Beek (bass guitar, baritone vocals), and [[Jamie Oldaker]] (drums). Under the band's original lineup, they signed to [[Arista Nashville]] in 1994, releasing their [[The Tractors (album)|self-titled debut album]] that year; the album only produced one Top 40 hit on the [[Hot Country Songs|''Billboard'' country charts]]. \n\nSince their foundation, most of the band's original members moved on to separate projects, although they often collaborated with frontman Ripley on The Tractors' more recent recordings. Ripley was the only official member of the group throughout its tenure; he had stated that The Tractors was more of a \"state of mind\",<ref name=\"tractors2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thetractors.com/|title=THE TRACTORS|website=Thetractors.com|accessdate=5 January 2019}}</ref> and the band contained a largely undefined cast of unofficial contributors.\n\n==Biography==\nThe Tractors were formed in 1988 by [[Steve Ripley]].<ref name=\"cst1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/article.asp?xid=807|title=The Tractors plow ahead – November 1998|website=Countrystandardtime.com|accessdate=5 January 2019}}</ref> The original lineup comprised Ron Getman ([[electric guitar]] and [[slide guitar]]); [[Jamie Oldaker]] ([[Drum kit|drums]]); Walt Richmond ([[bass (vocal range)|bass]] vocals, [[keyboard instrument|keyboards]]); [[Steve Ripley]] (guitar, [[Singing|lead vocals]]); and Casey Van Beek ([[bass guitar]], [[baritone]] vocals).<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-tractors-mn0000481827/biography|title=The Tractors - Biography & History|website=AllMusic|accessdate=5 January 2019}}</ref> All five members had previously been backing musicians for other notable artists, including [[Bob Dylan]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Bonnie Raitt]], [[Linda Ronstadt]], and [[Leonard Cohen]].<ref name=\"cst1\"/> Oldaker had also played with [[Leon Russell]], [[Peter Frampton]], and [[Bob Seger]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tulsaworld.com/entertainment/music/tulsa-sound-musician-jamie-oldaker-dies-peter-frampton-eric-clapton-praise-hall-of-fame-drummer/article_c5b46473-6720-59ed-8a87-de371587dbe1.html|title=Tulsa Sound musician Jamie Oldaker dies; Peter Frampton, Eric Clapton praise hall of fame drummer|last = Tramel|first = Jimmie|website = [[Tulsa World]]|date=17 July 2020 |accessdate=5 September 2021}}</ref>\n\nBy 1990, the group was signed to Arista Nashville, a newly formed record label based in [[Nashville, Tennessee]] and a subsidiary of [[Arista Records]].<ref name=\"cst1\"/> In 1994, they released their self-titled debut album, which produced the single, \"[[Baby Likes to Rock It]],\" and soon became the fastest-selling debut album from a country group to reach platinum status.
