''The Tommy Hunter Show'' began as a [[CBC Radio]] program in 1960, replacing the long-running variety show ''[[The Happy Gang]]'', and went on to replace ''Country Hoedown'' on CBC Television in 1965; Hunter's show was picked up by [[The Nashville Network|TNN]] in 1983 and ran on CBC until 1992. Performers on the show included singer-songwriter [[Gordon Lightfoot]] in the early years of his own musical career. \n\nThe book ''Cue the Elephant'' by [[Knowlton Nash]] (1996, McClelland & Stewart) featured some disparaging remarks from the show's make-up artist. \"He could sell himself terrifically but there was no love lost between Tommy and the crew. Some of the guys loathed him ... Everybody made snide remarks behind Tommy's back ... people might say he was the biggest jerk in the world. But that was not my experience. For me, I saw a very easy down-to-earth manner. But Tommy does generate anti as well as pro feelings from people ... he didn't trust people around him, he became a monster to some.\"\n\nPeople who performed on ''The Tommy Hunter Show'' early in their careers include:\n*[[Garth Brooks]]\n*[[Shania Twain]], then known as Eileen Twain\n*[[The Judds]]\n*[[Yvonne Murray (singer)|Yvonne Murray]]<ref>''RPM Weekly'', Volume 39 No. 7 October 15, 1983 - [https://worldradiohistory.com/CANADA/RPM/80s/1983/RPM-1983-10-15.pdf Page 16 Watch for yet another YVONNE MURRAY guest appearance on the Tommy Hunter Show, October 21st, 8:00 pm EST, CDC.]</ref>\n\nAfter his show was cancelled by the CBC, Hunter continued to tour with his band, ''The Travelling Men''.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://ottawacitizen.com/Entertainment/Canada+country+gentleman+long+from+done/1221067/story.html | newspaper=[[Ottawa Citizen]] | title=Canada's country gentleman a long way from done | first=Lynn | last=Saxberg | date=January 27, 2009 | access-date=January 27, 2009 | archive-date=May 15, 2022 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220515002605/https://ottawacitizen.com/Entertainment/Canada+country+gentleman+long+from+done/1221067/story.html | url-status=dead }}</ref> He retired after his final tour in 2012.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/television/tommy-hunter-hangs-up-his-guitar/article561125/ | work=[[The Globe and Mail]] | title=Tommy Hunter hangs up his guitar | first=Guy | last=Dixon | date=January 9, 2011 | access-date=February 16, 2023 }}</ref>\n\n==Awards and recognition==\nHunter was inducted into the [[Canadian Country Music Hall of Fame]] in 1984.
