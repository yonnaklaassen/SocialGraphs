Turner's musical character has always been a charged combination of mystery as well as light, melancholy mixed with a ferocious vitality that often flirted with danger.}}\n\n=== Awards, honors and achievements ===\n{{Main|List of awards and nominations received by Tina Turner}}\n[[File:Don Grierson with Tina Turner.jpg|thumb|left|Turner holding certification plaques with [[Don Grierson (music business)|Don Grierson]]]]\n\nTurner previously held a [[Guinness World Record]] for the largest paying audience (180,000 in 1988) for a solo performer.<ref name=\"upi88\"/><ref name=\"Guinness\"/> In the UK, Turner was the first artist to have a top 40 hit in seven consecutive decades; she has a total of 35 UK top 40 hits.<ref name=\"Chart UK-2018\"/> She sold over 100&nbsp;million records worldwide, including certified RIAA album sales of 10&nbsp;million.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Gold & Platinum: Top Artists |publisher=Record Industry Association of America |url= https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=top_tallies&ttt=TAA&col=certified_units&ord=asc#search_section |access-date=April 22, 2020 |archive-date=June 5, 2020 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200605003954/https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=top_tallies&ttt=TAA&col=certified_units&ord=asc#search_section |url-status=live}}</ref> As of May 2023, Turner has reportedly sold around 100 to 150 million records worldwide.<ref>{{Cite magazine |date=May 24, 2023 |title=Tina Turner, 'Queen of Rock 'n' Roll,' Dead at 83 |url= https://time.com/6282453/tina-turner-dies-83/ |access-date=May 27, 2023 |magazine=Time |language=en |archive-date=May 26, 2023 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20230526155048/https://time.com/6282453/tina-turner-dies-83/ |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Boyce |first=Hunter |title=Remembering Tina Turner: a look inside the star's stunning $76 million Swiss estate |language=en |work=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution |url= https://www.ajc.com/life/private-quarters/remembering-tina-turner-a-look-inside-the-stars-stunning-76-million-swiss-estate/Z7ESVYKWJ5BXPF3PLSD6Q6R6GU/ |access-date=May 27, 2023 |issn=1539-7459 |archive-date=May 27, 2023 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20230527041726/https://www.ajc.com/life/private-quarters/remembering-tina-turner-a-look-inside-the-stars-stunning-76-million-swiss-estate/Z7ESVYKWJ5BXPF3PLSD6Q6R6GU/ |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |date=May 25, 2023 |title=Tina Turner's intimate and unexpected connection to St. John's and Newfoundland |language=en-CA |work=The Globe and Mail |url= https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/article-st-johns-was-a-safe-spot-for-tina-turner-and-newfoundlanders-remember/ |access-date=May 27, 2023 |archive-date=May 26, 2023 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20230526224747/https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/article-st-johns-was-a-safe-spot-for-tina-turner-and-newfoundlanders-remember/ |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nTurner won a total of 12 Grammy Awards.
