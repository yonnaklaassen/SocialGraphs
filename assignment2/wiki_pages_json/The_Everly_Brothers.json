Consisting of [[Don Everly|Isaac Donald \"Don\" Everly]] and [[Phil Everly|Phillip \"Phil\" Everly]], the duo combined elements of [[rock and roll]], [[country music|country]], and [[pop music|pop]],<ref name=\"Unterberger\">{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-everly-brothers-mn0000046699/biography |title=The Everly Brothers |last=Unterberger |first=Richie   |publisher=Allmusic |access-date=September 20, 2021}}</ref> becoming pioneers of [[country rock]].<ref name=RecordCollector/><ref name=Hoffman/>\n\nThe duo was raised in a musical family, first appearing on radio in Iowa singing with their father Ike Everly and mother Margaret Everly as \"The Everly Family\" in the 1940s, and in Knoxville, Tennessee, while the brothers were in high school.  They gained the attention of [[Chet Atkins]], who began to promote them for national attention.\n\nThey began writing and recording their own music in 1956, and their first hit song came in 1957, with \"[[Bye Bye Love (The Everly Brothers song)|Bye Bye Love]],\" written by [[Felice and Boudleaux Bryant]]. The song hit No. 1 in the spring of 1957, and additional hits would follow through 1958, many of them written by the Bryants, including \"[[Wake Up Little Susie]],\" \"[[All I Have to Do Is Dream]],\" and \"[[Problems (The Everly Brothers song)|Problems]].\" In 1960, they signed with [[Warner Bros. Records]] and recorded \"[[Cathy's Clown]],\" written by the brothers themselves, which was their biggest selling single. The brothers enlisted in the [[United States Marine Corps Reserve]] in 1961 and their output dropped off, though additional hit singles continued through 1962, with \"[[That's Old Fashioned (That's the Way Love Should Be)]]\" being their last top-10 hit.\n\nLong-simmering disputes with [[Wesley Rose]], the CEO of [[Acuff-Rose Music]], which managed the group, and increased drug use in the 1960s, as well as changing tastes in popular music, led to the duo's decline in popularity in its native U.S., though the brothers continued to release hit singles in the U.K. and Canada and had many highly successful tours throughout the 1960s. In the early 1970s, the brothers began releasing solo recordings, and in 1973 they officially broke up. Starting in 1983, the brothers got back together and continued to perform periodically until Phil's death in 2014. Don died seven years later.\n\nThe group had a major influence on the music of the generation that followed it. Many of the top acts of the 1960s were heavily influenced by the close-harmony singing and acoustic guitar playing of the Everly Brothers including [[the Beatles]], [[the Beach Boys]], the [[Bee Gees]], and [[Simon & Garfunkel]].

In 1961, the brothers had a falling out with Wesley Rose during the recording of \"Temptation\". Rose was reportedly upset that the Everlys were recording a song which he had not published and, hence, for which he would not be paid any publishing royalties. Rose made efforts to block the record's release. The Everlys held firm to their position, and as a result, in the early 1960s, they were shut off from Acuff-Rose songwriters. These included Felice and Boudleaux Bryant, who had written and composed most of their hits, as well as the Everlys themselves, who were still contracted to Acuff-Rose as songwriters and had written several of their own hits. From 1961 through early 1964, the Everlys recorded songs by other composers to avoid paying any royalties to Acuff-Rose. They used the pseudonym \"Jimmy Howard\" as writer or arranger on two selections they wrote and recorded during this time. This ruse, however, was ultimately unsuccessful, as Acuff-Rose gained legal possession of the copyrights once the deception was discovered.<ref name=\"alca\">{{cite web|url=https://alancackett.com/phil-everly/|title=Phil Everly|website=Alan Cackett |access-date=September 15, 2021}}</ref>\nAround this time, the brothers also set up their own record label, Calliope Records, for solo projects. Using the pseudonym \"Adrian Kimberly\", Don recorded a big-band instrumental version of [[Edward Elgar]]'s first \"[[Pomp and Circumstance]]\" march, which [[Neal Hefti]] arranged and which charted in the United States top 40 in mid-1961. Further instrumental singles credited to Kimberly followed, but none of those charted. Phil formed the Keestone Family Singers, which featured [[Glen Campbell]] and [[Carole King]]. Their lone single, \"Melodrama\", failed to chart, and by the end of 1962, Calliope Records had gone out of business.\nThe Everly Brothers' last United States top 10 hit was 1962's \"That's Old Fashioned (That's The Way Love Should Be)\", a song recorded but unreleased by [[The Chordettes]] and given to the brothers by their old mentor, Archie Bleyer.<ref name=\"ebmf\"/>\n\nIn succeeding years the Everly Brothers sold fewer records in the United States.

The Everlys' first two albums for Warners (in 1960 and 1961) peaked at No.&nbsp;9 US, but after that, of a dozen more LPs for Warner Bros., only one made the top 200 – 1965's \"[[Beat & Soul]]\", which peaked at No.&nbsp;141.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nysmusic.com/2021/08/23/don-everly-1937-2021/|last=O'Shea|first=Tim|date=August 23, 2021|title=Don Everly, 1937–2021|website=NYS Music|access-date=September 17, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/the-everly-brothers/chart-history/tlp/|title=Chart History: The Everly Brothers – Beat & Soul|magazine=Billboard|access-date=September 17, 2021}}</ref>\n\nThe Everlys' dispute with Acuff-Rose lasted until 1964, when they resumed writing and composing as well as working with the Bryants.
