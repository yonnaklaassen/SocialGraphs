After being discovered at a local talent competition in 2004, Carroll was signed to the [[Arista Nashville]] label in 2006, releasing his debut album ''[[Waitin' in the Country]]'' that year. This album produced three consecutive Top 40 country hits for him on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts: \"[[Alyssa Lies]]\", \"[[Livin' Our Love Song]]\" and \"[[I Can Sleep When I'm Dead]]\". Carroll's second album, ''[[Growing Up Is Getting Old (album)|Growing Up Is Getting Old]]'', has also produced his fourth and fifth Top 40 hits. Carroll and Arista Nashville parted ways in February 2010.\n\n==Life and career==\nCarroll grew up in a religious household in [[Youngsville, North Carolina]]. His father (James P. Carroll) was a conservative Christian minister who viewed modern music as sinful and would not allow any secular music played in the home, or even on family trips in the car. His father went so far as to spank him when he found a copy of [[Billy Ray Cyrus]]' \"[[Achy Breaky Heart]]\" in his bedroom.<ref name=\"extend\">{{cite web|url=http://www.billceller.com/showstuff.html |title=Bill Celler |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071118073858/http://www.billceller.com/showstuff.html |archive-date=November 18, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2004 encouraged by his mother (Pamela Clark Carroll), Carroll won a local singing competition, [[WRAZ (TV)|WRAZ]] FOX 50's ''Gimme the Mic''.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> During this same period, Carroll had finished writing \"Alyssa Lies.\" Carroll says he struggled to the point of getting migraines for a year and a half before finishing the song. By the summer of 2005, Carroll was a regular along Nashville's [[Music Row]].  He later signed with the booking agency Monterey Peninsula Artists Nashville and entered a recording agreement with [[Arista Nashville]].\n\n==Musical career==\n\n===''Waitin' in the Country''===\nCarroll's debut album, ''[[Waitin' in the Country]]'', produced by [[Don Gehman]], was released on February 6, 2007. In its opening week, it debuted at No.&nbsp;1 on the Billboard Top Country Albums Charts. With first-week sales of 57,608, and a Billboard 200 pop chart entry at No.&nbsp;8, Carroll had once achieved both the best unit sales and the highest pop chart debut by a new country male artist since [[Billy Ray Cyrus]] in 1993.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jasonmichaelcarroll.com/site.php?em2253=116321_-1__0_~0_-1_2_2007_0_0&content=news|title=Jason Michael Carroll News|access-date=February 15, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927190040/http://www.jasonmichaelcarroll.com/site.php?em2253=116321_-1__0_~0_-1_2_2007_0_0&content=news|archive-date=September 27, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> The debut single from ''Waitin' in the Country'', entitled \"[[Alyssa Lies]]\", reached No.&nbsp;5 on the [[Hot Country Songs]] charts.
