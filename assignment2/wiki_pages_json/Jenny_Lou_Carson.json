She was raised in Decatur in modest surroundings. She learned to work early in life and was expected to do chores around the house.  Her father had a strict, no-nonsense personality who instilled a strong work ethic and a fierce win-at-any-cost sense of competition in his children. In her adult life she rarely spoke of her early days to any of her friends or business associates, other than to occasionally remark, \"You don't need friends if you've got your family with you.\"\n\n==Career==\nCarson began her professional music career at age 17 in 1932, performing with her sisters Evelyn and Eva Alaine (AKA: [[Judy Martin (singer)|Judy Martin]]) Overstake as the [[Judy Martin (singer)#The Three Little Maids|Three Little Maids]] on [[WLS (AM)|WLS]]'s ''[[National Barn Dance]]'' in Chicago.<ref>{{cite book|title= The Encyclopedia of Country Music, page538 |author=Samuelson, Dave|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=1998|isbn=978-0-19-977055-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=untabCgOVkgC&q=Eva+Overstake+Foley+dies+at+home+in+Nashville&pg=PA538|access-date=December 3, 2013}}</ref> Carson also performed briefly as Winnie in the trio Winnie, Lou, and Sally (WLS). The Overstake sisters also performed as The Little Country Girls.\nFrom 1938 to 1939 she recorded under the name Lucille Lee with the Sweet Violet Boys, also known as The [[Prairie Ramblers]].\n\nFashioning herself as a 20th-century [[Annie Oakley]], Overstake assumed the name Jenny Lou Carson in September 1939. She became an expert sharpshooter and learned to spin a rope and manipulate a bullwhip. She toured the state of Texas putting on her cowgirl show and singing with her partner, Texas Tommy.\n\nDuring World War II she wrote popular songs about soldier boys and home.  She was known as the \"Radio Chin-Up Girl\" and received lots of fan letters from servicemen and their families.\n\nJenny Lou Carson authored ''[[Jealous Heart]]'' for [[Tex Ritter]], a song that stayed on the hit charts for 23 weeks in 1945, and ''[[You Two-Timed Me One Time Too Often]]'', the first top country hit written by a woman, which stayed at No. 1 on the country chart for 11 weeks in 1945.<ref>{{cite book |title= The Billboard Book Of Top 40 Country Hits: 1944–2006, Second edition|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |author-link=Joel Whitburn |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=292}}</ref>\n\nCarson wrote a great many songs for a number of country music stars such as [[Roy Acuff]], [[Eddy Arnold]], [[Ernest Tubb]], and [[Red Foley]], who had married her sister Eva. She co-wrote with Al Hill, a pseudonym used by [[Fred Wise (lyricist)|Fred Wise]], Kathleen Twomey, and [[Ben Weisman]], the 1954 popular hit ''[[Let Me Go, Lover!]]'', first performed by 18-year-old [[Joan Weber]] and subsequently recorded by [[Hank Snow]], [[Teresa Brewer]], [[Peggy Lee]], [[Patti Page]], and [[Sunny Gale]]. \n \nHer song catalog contains more than 170 songs that have been professionally recorded by more than 180 artists.\n\nIn 1971 she was inducted into the [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]].\n\n==Married life==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2019}}\nOn July 16, 1934, at age 19, she married fellow [[National Barn Dance]] performer [[Red Blanchard|Donald Francis \"Red\" Blanchard]].  The marriage was doomed from the start.  They quickly separated and were divorced shortly thereafter. She immediately married 34-year-old Indiana native Myrl \"Jack\" Dumbauld on November 17, 1936, in Chicago, Illinois. After nine months the marriage was falling apart and they eventually separated several months later. It was not until September 1945 that Carson applied for and was granted a divorce from Dumbauld.\n\nOn May 1, 1946, Carson married 39-year-old [[Tiny Hill|Harry Lawrence \"Tiny\" Hill]], a successful [[big band]] entertainer. The couple had a successful business partnership with Hill performing many of Carson's songs. In January 1947 the Hills purchased a home in [[Ft. Wayne, Indiana]]. Their marriage was not successful, and Carson filed for divorce in April 1949; it became final on July 5, 1949. Carson entered her fourth marriage on April 28, 1951, to a 45-year-old Chicago drug store executive named William H. Newman.  Within two years Carson left Newman and moved to Texas with her mother.\n\n==Partial list of Carson's songs==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n*''Ain'tcha Tired of Makin' Me Blue''\n*''A Pair of Broken Hearts'' (1945) (Co-written by [[Fred Rose (songwriter)|Fred Rose]])\n*''A Penny for Your Thoughts'' (1947)\n*''Another Night is Coming'' (1950) (Co-written by [[Moon Mullican]])\n*''Blues in My Heart''  (1949) (Co-written by Red Foley)\n*''Chained to a Memory'' (1946)\n*''C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S''  (1949) (co-written by Eddy Arnold)\n*''Darling, What More Can I Do?''
