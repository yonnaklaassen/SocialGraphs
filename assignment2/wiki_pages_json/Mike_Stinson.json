Something that would stand alone among the country albums I love that I considered classics. I had the burning desire to do that for a long time and I did it on three records to the best of my ability. And I sort of got it out of my system. I'm sort of exploring other music styles I've been influenced by over the years. This album's got a little muscle, it's a little tougher. The singing is better and the writing is better. I think it shows some growth.\"<ref>interview on the [http://americanamusicshow.com/episode155 Americana Music Show, episode 155], released September 2, 2013</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n* ''Jack of All Heartache'' (2002)\n* ''Last Fool at the Bar'' (2005)\n* ''The Jukebox in Your Heart'' (2010)\n* ''Hell and Half of Georgia'' (2013)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://mikestinsonmusic.com/ Mike Stinson official website]\n* [http://archives.nodepression.com/artist/mike-stinson/ Articles on Stinson from No Depression archives]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Stinson, Mike}}\n[[Category:American male singer-songwriters]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Year of birth missing (living people)]]"
