Irwin was a finalist on the [[America's Got Talent (season 2)|second season]] of ''[[America's Got Talent]]''.\n\n==Biography==\nPrior to her ''[[America's Got Talent]]'' debut, Irwin has stated she has never performed publicly or received any vocal lessons. According to her bio on the [[NBC]] website, Irwin attended Harford [[Christianity|Christian]] School where she was a [[cheerleader]] and became the [[class president]]. She is also said to want to sing the [[national anthem]] at [[Camden Yards]], the home of the [[Baltimore Orioles]].\n\nIrwin is a very devoted [[country music]] fan. In her own words, on her public website, she states:\n<blockquote>\nI live for country music. If it didn't exist, a huge piece of my life would be missing. It wakes me up in the morning and puts me to sleep at night, and it's on my mind 24 hours a day.<ref name=\"JIrwinMusic\">{{cite web\n|url = http://myspace.com/julienneirwinmusic\n|title = About Julienne Irwin\n|access-date = 2007-10-19\n|author = Julienne Irwin\n|work = The Official Julienne Irwin MySpace Page\n|publisher = MySpace.com\n}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nShe also values her education:\n<blockquote>\nSchool is such an integral part of my life. I really think it has molded me into who I am today.<ref name=\"JIrwinMusic\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\n===2007: ''America's Got Talent''===\nAs in the previous year, the show consisted of a nationwide search, through thousands of applicants all competing for the top one million dollar prize.\n\nIrwin first auditioned in [[New York City|New York]], with an a cappella rendition of \"[[How Do I Live]]\" ([[LeAnn Rimes]]) by [[Diane Warren]].<ref>{{cite web\n|url = http://cocatalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?v1=1&ti=1,1&Search%5FArg=PA0000852491&Search%5FCode=REGS&CNT=25&SID=1\n|title = Registration Number: PA0000852491  \n|access-date = 2007-10-18\n|work = Copyright Catalog\n|publisher = United States Copyright Office\n}}</ref>  The judges unanimously praised her raw talent and invited her to the [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] callbacks.\n\nIn subsequent shows, Irwin performed individual songs and passed through to the next round as follows:\n\n* ''Las Vegas Callbacks:''  \"[[At Last]]\" ([[Etta James]]) by [[Mack Gordon]] and [[Harry Warren]].

After the song, judge [[Piers Morgan]] said:\n<blockquote>\n.Julienne, I still don't think you've done enough to win, but I've gotta say, that was a brilliant performance.  And I think if America gives votes for people that make me look stupid, you're going to get lots of votes.\n<ref name=\"AGTFinalFour\">{{cite episode\n |title       = The Final Four\n |url         = http://www.nbc.com/Americas_Got_Talent\n |series      = America's Got Talent\n |series-link  = America's Got Talent (season 2)\n |network     = NBC\n |airdate     = 2007-08-14\n |season      = 2\n |number      = 210\n |access-date = 2007-08-15\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20070816063814/http://www.nbc.com/Americas_Got_Talent/\n |archive-date = 2007-08-16\n |url-status    = dead\n}}</ref> \n</blockquote>\n\nThe \"Season Finale\" was about entertainment, performance reviews and announcement of results.  Irwin performed \"[[Teardrops on My Guitar]]\" with the famous country singer-songwriter [[Taylor Swift]].<ref>{{cite web\n|url = http://cocatalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?v1=1&ti=1,1&Search%5FArg=PA0001381162&Search%5FCode=REGS&CNT=25&SID=1\n|title = Registration Number: PA0001381162\n|access-date = 2007-10-18\n|work = Copyright Catalog\n|publisher = United States Copyright Office\n}}</ref>  After the song, Swift was asked, based on her experience as a teenage Country Music singer, what advice she would offer to Irwin.  In reply, Swift commented:\n<blockquote>\n... She [Irwin] has such an adorable personality, and that's so much of the battle right there.  You know, being so endearing and so so humble.  I think she should just stay who she is.  I think she's got it.\n<ref name=\"AGTSeasonFin\">{{cite episode\n |title       = Season Finale\n |url         = http://www.nbc.com/Americas_Got_Talent\n |series      = America's Got Talent\n |series-link  = America's Got Talent (season 2)\n |network     = NBC\n |airdate     = 2007-08-21\n |season      = 2\n |number      = 211\n |access-date = 2007-08-15\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20070816063814/http://www.nbc.com/Americas_Got_Talent/\n |archive-date = 2007-08-16\n |url-status    = dead\n}}</ref> \n</blockquote>\n\nAfterward, a prerecorded message was played from four-time [[Country Music Association|CMA]] and three-time [[Academy of Country Music|ACM]] Female Vocalist of the Year winner, [[Martina McBride]].  In it she said:\n<blockquote>\nI just want to take this chance to let you know that I'm really impressed with your [Irwin's] singing.  You have a great voice. It's wonderful to watch you. As a matter of fact, watching you brings back a lot of memories of myself singing when I was your age...\n  <ref name=\"AGTSeasonFin\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\nIt was later announced that Irwin was the first contestant eliminated of the final four.\n\n==Career==\nOn September 9, 2007, Julienne Irwin got to live her dream of singing the national anthem at Camden Yards, as reported in the September 10, 2007 issue of the Baltimore Sun.  In the words of Sun reporter, John-John Williams IV:\n<blockquote>\n\nBefore she performed, the Bel Air resident showed signs of a typical awe-struck teenager. Her jaw dropped after a brief conversation with Orioles starter Melvin Mora.\n\n\"Oh my gosh!\" she mouthed to her father, Felix \"Phil\" Irwin.\n\nWhen it was time to perform, Julienne displayed the poise and maturity that captured fans this summer. The words of the anthem flowed with the clarity and strength of a professional. Julienne later said she was a bundle of nerves inside.<ref name=\"Camden Yards\">{{cite news|last=Williams|first=John-John|date=2007-09-10|title=She's got talent -- and hometown pride, too|work=The Baltimore Sun|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/entertainment/tv/bal-md.irwin10sep10,0,5727159.story|access-date=2007-10-15}}{{Dead link|date=August 2019|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}</ref>\n\n</blockquote>\n\nThe story goes on to say that Julienne is settling into life as a student. She began her freshman year at Harford Christian School in Darlington earlier that week.\n\nOn September 23, 2007, Julienne Irwin's singing once again brought her to the national stage.  She was invited to sing the national anthem to a crowd of 140,000 spectators at the Dodge Dealers 400, at Dover International Speedway, as televised on ABC to a nationwide audience.<ref>{{cite press release\n | title = America's Got Talent finalist Julienne Irwin to perform National Anthem prior to the start of the Dodge Dealers 400 on Sept. 23, 2007\n | publisher = Dover International Speedway\n | date = 2007-09-07\n | url = http://www.doverspeedway.com/track/press/article.php?dir=200709&id=1326\n | access-date = 2007-10-19\n | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080322110754/http://www.doverspeedway.com/track/press/article.php?dir=200709&id=1326\n | archive-date = 2008-03-22\n | url-status = dead\n }}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n|url = http://www.doverspeedway.com/fanzone/slideshow.php?gallery_id=143&gal_name=Dodge%20Dealers%20400%20NASCAR%20NEXTEL%20Cup%20Series%20race%20(September%2023,%202007)&ids=5124:5125:5126:5127:5128:5129:5130:5131:5132:5133:5134:5135:5136:5137:5145:5144:5143:5142:5141:5140&num=11:20\n|title = Dodge Dealers 400 NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series race (September 23, 2007)\n|access-date = 2007-10-19\n|work = Monster Mile Photo Gallery\n|publisher = Dover International Speedway\n|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110517122739/http://www.doverspeedway.com/fanzone/slideshow.php?gallery_id=143&gal_name=Dodge%20Dealers%20400%20NASCAR%20NEXTEL%20Cup%20Series%20race%20(September%2023,%202007)&ids=5124:5125:5126:5127:5128:5129:5130:5131:5132:5133:5134:5135:5136:5137:5145:5144:5143:5142:5141:5140&num=11:20\n|archive-date = May 17, 2011\n|url-status = dead\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n|url = http://www.nascar.com/2007/races/lapbylap/09/23/dover2/4.html\n|title = Lap-by-Lap: Dover\n|access-date = 2007-10-19\n|author = NASCAR.COM\n|date = 2007-09-23\n|publisher = Turner Sports Interactive, Inc.\n|pages = 5\n|quote = 1:31 p.m. -- Julienne Irwin, a finalist from America's Got Talent, sings the national anthem.\n|archive-date = 2011-06-28\n|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110628222358/http://www.nascar.com/2007/races/lapbylap/09/23/dover2/4.html\n|url-status = dead\n}}</ref>\n\nIrwin announced on her MySpace that she was going to tour with [[Kenny Rogers]] in December 2007.
