Outlaw calls his music \"SoCal country\", country music refashioned with a Southern California vibe of the classic honky-tonk and troubadour pop.<ref name=\"Shore Fire\">{{cite web|title=Introducing a Country Singer Living in Los Angeles|url=http://shorefire.com/releases/entry/introducing-a-country-singer-living-in-los-angeles-sam-outlaw-new-lp-angele|website=Shore Fire Media|accessdate=April 8, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nOutlaw was born in [[Aberdeen, South Dakota]] as Sam Morgan.<ref name=\"Lonesome Highway\">{{cite web|last1=Rapid|first1=Stephen|title=Interview With Sam Outlaw By Stephen Rapid|url=http://www.lonesomehighway.com/interviews/2014/2/17/interview-with-sam-outlaw-by-stephen-rapid.html|website=Lonesome Highway|date=February 17, 2014|accessdate=April 8, 2015}}</ref> At the age of 10, his family moved to southern California. He grew up in a conservative Christian home and was limited by his parents as to what kind of music he could listen to. He did however, note the influence of Western Swing band [[Asleep at the Wheel]] and how their all-star tribute albums to [[Bob Wills & His Texas Playboys]] acted as \"country music in a bottle\" for him. [[The Beatles]] were also a huge influence on Outlaw. As a young adult, he had a musical revelation when he heard the classic country voices of [[Emmylou Harris]] and [[George Jones]]. Outlaw notes that George Jones' music inspired him to get more serious about playing the guitar and writing songs.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Exclusive Video Premiere: \"Ghost Town\" by Sam Outlaw|url = http://thedailysouth.southernliving.com/2015/07/07/exclusive-video-premiere-ghost-town-by-sam-outlaw/|website = The Daily South|access-date = 2016-02-23}}</ref>\n\nIn \"his late 20s ... both his parents’ and his own marriage simultaneously crumbled.\"<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.laweekly.com/music/sam-outlaw-is-on-a-mission-to-make-country-music-that-doesn-t-suck-6868319 |title = Sam Outlaw is on a Mission to Make \"Country Music That Doesn't Suck\"|date = 2016-04-27}}</ref>\n\nWhen Outlaw decided to actively pursue a music career, he borrowed his mother's maiden name, Outlaw, for a stage moniker. His mother has since died and he honors her by continuing to use the family name.<ref name=\"Shore Fire\" />\n\n==Career==\nSam Outlaw had a successful advertising career in Southern California; however, on his thirtieth birthday he switched gears to pursue his passion for music. Outlaw self-released an EP in 2014. It immediately created a buzz and he secured performance slots at the [[Stagecoach Festival]] and AmericanaFest produced by the [[Americana Music Association]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = Sam Outlaw Spreads SoCal Country Sound With 'Angeleno'|url = http://theboot.com/sam-outlaw-angeleno-interview-2015/|website = The Boot|access-date = 2016-02-23}}</ref>\n\nCMT featured his music video, ''Cry For Me'', in 2014.\n\nWhile enlisting a crack group of backing musicians to record ''Angeleno'', Outlaw's first LP, he began working with musician and record producer, [[Ry Cooder]].
