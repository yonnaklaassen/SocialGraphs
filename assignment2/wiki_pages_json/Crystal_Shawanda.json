She signed a publishing deal with Island Bound Music in 2014,and then signed a production deal with Scott Hendricks in 2015, and signed with RCA records in 2016.\n\nMany of Shawanda's songs have been inspired by her connections to Wiikwemkoong and part of her 2016 album was recorded at the Debajehmujig Creation Centre in [[Assiginack|Manitowaning, Manitoulin Island]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.manitoulin.ca/2016/04/27/crystal-shawanda-talks-two-new-albums-set-release-summer/|title=Crystal Shawanda talks about her two new albums set to release this summer|last=Burridge|first=Robin|date=2016-04-27|work=Manitoulin Expositor|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180315070442/http://www.manitoulin.ca/2016/04/27/crystal-shawanda-talks-two-new-albums-set-release-summer/|archive-date=2018-03-15|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Music career==\nShawanda's first album, ''[[Dawn of a New Day (Crystal Shawanda album)|Dawn of a New Day]]'', was released in Canada on June 24, 2008, and in the United States on August 19. The album entered the Canadian Country Albums chart at number 2, and the ''Billboard'' [[Top Country Albums]] chart at number 16.

In mid-2009, Shawanda left RCA Nashville and, through her own record label, New Sun Records, and a distribution deal with EMI released a Christmas album titled ''I'll Be Home for Christmas''.\n\nIn 2010, Shawanda released a single, \"Beautiful Day\", via her own label, New Sun Records.

Shawanda's second studio album, ''[[Just Like You (Crystal Shawanda album)|Just Like You]]'', was released by New Sun on April 24, 2012, and won a Juno award for Aboriginal Album of the year in 2013. She became the first full blood Indigenous woman as the CEO of a record label, to procure these milestones.\n\nIn 2014, Shawanda made a departure from country music and released a Blues album titled \"The Whole World's got the Blues\",she focused on rather than regurgitating someone else's blues, she told her story as an Indigenous woman in \"Pray Sister Pray\", which raised awareness of the Missing and Murdered Indigenous women issue, across Canada. She filmed a music video in her hometown with the help of her community, and the music video is now being used in schools across Canada, as a teaching tool of this rising issue. This album was nominated for \"Aboriginal Album of the year\", and Shawanda was invited to perform at the Juno Awards opening Gala.\n\nIn 2016, Shawanda released her 4th album \"Fish out of water\", feeling torn between her future and her past, the album had a mix of Blues and country music songs, which ended up having am Americana sound. Perhaps best said by DMME.net \"She's a force of nature, Crystal Shawanda, the Canadian singer may reside in Nashville, but her casting as a country artist, whitewashed as the genre demands, is hopefully over\".\n\nIn 2017, Shawanda released \"Voo Doo Woman\", consisting of 6 covers of blues standards, and 4 originals. Later that year Crystal signed a record deal with True North Records, who rereleased the album later that year, and they achieved moderate airplay at Blues Radio in America.\n\nIn 2020, Shawanda released \"Church House Blues\",which had extensive airplay at Blues Radio in America, and in Europe. She also went on to become the first Indigenous woman to win a Juno award for \"Blues album of the year\".\n\nIn 2022 Crystal released \"Midnight Blues\", which debuted at #8 on the American Billboard blues chart, and she became the first full blood Indigenous person to appear on this chart. She also received extensive airplay at Blues radio. This album was also nominated for \"blues album of the year\" at the Juno awards.\n\n==Discography==\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:16em;\"| Title\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:22em;\"| Album details\n! colspan=\"2\"| Peak chart<br />positions\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n! width=\"45\"| [[Top Country Albums|US Country]]<br><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/crystal-shawanda/chart-history/clp/|title=Crystal Shawanda- Country Albums|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=April 30, 2019}}</ref>\n! width=\"45\"| [[Billboard 200|US]]<br /><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/crystal-shawanda/chart-history/tlp/|title=Crystal Shawanda - Billboard 200|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=April 30, 2019}}</ref>\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[Dawn of a New Day (Crystal Shawanda album)|Dawn of a New Day]]''\n| \n* Release date: June 24, 2008\n* Label: [[RCA Records Nashville|RCA Nashville]]\n| 16\n| 81\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''I'll Be Home for Christmas''\n| \n* Release date: December 1, 2009\n* Label: New Sun/EMI/On Ramp Records\n| —\n| —\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[Just Like You (Crystal Shawanda album)|Just Like You]]''\n| \n* Release date: April 24, 2012\n* Label: New Sun Records/[[Fontana North]]\n| _\n| —\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''The Whole World's Got the Blues''\n| \n* Release date: September 30, 2014\n* Label: New Sun Records\n| —\n| —\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Fish Out of Water''\n|\n* Release date: October 2016\n* Label: New Sun Records\n| —\n| —\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Voodoo Woman''\n|\n* Release date: October 31, 2017\n* Label: New Sun Records/Fontana North\n| —\n| —\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Church House Blues''\n|\n* Release date: April 17, 2020\n* Label: True North Records\n| —\n| —\n|-\n|Midnight Blues                               \n|Release date: 2022\nLabel: True North Records\n|8\n|\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" style=\"font-size:8pt\" |\n|-\n|}\n\n===Singles===\n;Notes\n{{refbegin}}\n*a<span id=\"endnote_a\" ></span>'''[[#ref_a|^]]''' \"You Can Let Go\" also reached number nine on the [[Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles]] chart.<ref name=\"whitburn\">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2008|publisher=Record Research, Inc|page=376|year=2008|isbn=978-0-89820-177-2}}</ref>\n{{refend}}\n\n====As a featured artist====\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Year\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:18em;\"| Single\n!
