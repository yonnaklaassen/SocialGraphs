The [[Dallas]], Texas native currently resides in [[Nashville, Tennessee]].\n\n== Life and career ==\n=== Early life ===\nCartwright grew up in Dallas, Texas where he was given a guitar for his twelfth birthday and started penning his own songs shortly thereafter. By the time he hit high school, he was regularly playing in bars and local venues in town. A summer program at [[New York University]] exposed Cartwright to the world outside of Dallas and inspired him to head even further from home to attend the [[Berklee College of Music]] in [[Boston]], Massachusetts where he studied music business and songwriting. During college, he worked odd jobs in the music industry, including a stint as a wedding singer. Upon graduating in 2012, Cartwright moved back to Texas to pursue his own music career.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.berklee.edu/berklee-today/fall-2014/alumnotes|title=Alumnotes {{!}} Berklee College of Music|website=www.berklee.edu|access-date=17 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== 2013–2015 ===\nSoon after returning to Dallas, Texas, he recorded an EP, ''Bull Run'', earning him recognition at the 2013 [[B.
