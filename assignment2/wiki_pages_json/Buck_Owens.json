He and his first wife eventually settled there in 1951.{{sfn|Burke|2007|p=24}} Soon, Owens was frequently traveling to Hollywood for session recording jobs at [[Capitol Records]], playing backup for [[Tennessee Ernie Ford]], [[Wanda Jackson]], [[Tommy Collins (singer)|Tommy Collins]], [[Tommy Duncan]], and many others.{{sfn|Burke|2007|p=42–43}}\n\nUsing the pseudonym \"Corky Jones\" to prevent the recording of a rock 'n' roll tune from hurting his aspiring Country Music career, Owens recorded a [[rockabilly]] record called \"[[Hot Dog (Buck Owens song)|Hot Dog]]\" for the [[Pep Records|Pep label]].{{sfn|Burke|2007|p=44}} Some time in the 1950s he lived with his second wife and children in [[Fife, Washington]], where he sang with the Dusty Rhodes band.\n\nIn 1958 Owens met [[Don Rich]] in Steve's Gay 90s Restaurant in South [[Tacoma, Washington]].{{sfn|Fenster|1998|pp=399–400}} Owens had observed one of Rich's shows and immediately approached him about collaborating, after which Rich began playing fiddle with Owens at local venues. They were featured on the weekly BAR-K Jamboree on [[KSTW|KTNT-TV 11]]. In 1959, Owens' career took off when his song \"Second Fiddle\" hit No. 24 on the ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' country chart. Soon after, \"[[Under Your Spell Again]]\" made it to No. 4 on the charts and Capitol Records wanted Owens to return to Bakersfield, California.\n\nFollowing their success, Owens tried unsuccessfully to convince Rich to accompany him to Bakersfield. Instead, Rich opted to go to become a music teacher at [[Centralia College]]. While there, he tutored on the side but continued playing local venues. In December 1960, however, he left to rejoin Owens in Bakersfield.\n\n\"Above and Beyond\" hit No. 3.

His guitarist and longtime collaborator Don Rich, however, enjoyed it and convinced Owens to record it with the Buckaroos.  Laid down on February 12, 1963, it was released on March 11 and entered the charts of April 13. By June 15 the single began its first of four non-consecutive weeks at the No. 1 position, Owens' first top hit. [[The Beatles]] recorded a cover of it in 1965 with [[Ringo Starr]] as lead singer.

Owens and the Buckaroos had two songs reach No. 1 on the country music charts in 1969, \"Tall Dark Stranger\" and \"Who's Gonna Mow Your Grass\".  In 1969, they recorded a live album, ''Live in London'', where they premiered their rock song{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} \"A Happening In London Town\" and their version of [[Chuck Berry]]'s song \"[[Johnny B. Goode]]\".\n\nDuring this time ''Hee Haw'', starring Owens and the Buckaroos, was at its height of popularity. The series, originally envisioned as a country music's version of ''[[Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In]]'', went on to run in various incarnations for 231 episodes over 24 seasons. [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]] mentioned Owens by name in their 1970 single \"[[Lookin' Out My Back Door]]\".\n\nAlso between 1968 and 1970, Owens made guest appearances on top TV variety programs, including ''[[The Dean Martin Show]]'', ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', ''[[The Jackie Gleason Show]]'' and seven times on ''[[The Jimmy Dean Show]]''.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Owens and the Buckaroos enjoyed a string of hit duets with his protege [[Susan Raye]], who subsequently became a popular solo artist with Owens as her producer.\n\nIn 1971, the Buckaroos' bass guitarist [[Doyle Holly]] left the band to pursue a solo career. Holly was known for his booming deep voice on solo ballads. His departure was a setback to the band, as Doyle had received the Bass Player of the Year award from the [[Academy of Country Music]] the year before and served as co-lead vocalist (along with Don Rich) of the Buckaroos.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} Holly went on to record two solo records in the early 1970s, both were top 20 hits.\n\nOwens and Rich were the only members left of the original band, and in the 1970s they struggled to top the country music charts. However, the popularity of ''Hee Haw'' was allowing them to enjoy large crowds at indoor arenas.\n\nAfter three years of not having a number one song Owens and the Buckaroos finally had another No. 1 hit, \"[[Made in Japan (Buck Owens song)|Made in Japan]]\", in 1972. The band had been without pedal steel since late in 1969 when Maness departed.  In April he added pedal steel guitarist, [[Jerry Brightman]], and Owens returned to his grassroots sound of fiddle, steel, and electric guitars, releasing a string of singles including \"Arms Full of Empty\", \"Ain't it Amazing Gracie\" and \"Ain't Gonna Have Ole Buck (to Kick Around no More)\". Owens' original version of \"Streets of Bakersfield\" was released in 1972.\n\n===Death of Don Rich===\nOn July 17, 1974, Owens's best friend, the Buckaroos' guitarist [[Don Rich]], was killed when he lost control of his motorcycle and struck a guard rail on [[California State Route 1|Highway 1]] in [[Morro Bay, California|Morro Bay]], where he was to have joined his family for vacation. Owens was devastated. \"He was like a brother, a son and a best friend,\" he said in the late 1990s. \"Something I never said before, maybe I couldn't, but I think my music life ended when he died. Oh yeah, I carried on and I existed, but the real joy and love, the real lightning and thunder is gone forever.\"<ref>[http://www.salon.com/bc/1999/02/23bc.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031210085707/http://www.salon.com/bc/1999/02/23bc.html |date=December 10, 2003 }}</ref> Owens would never fully recover from the tragedy, either emotionally or professionally.\n\n===Business ventures===\n[[File:KUZZ logo.png|right|thumb|upright|KUZZ Radio logo featuring a depiction of Owens' trademark guitar]]\nBefore the 1960s ended, Owens and manager [[Jack McFadden]] began to concentrate on Owens' financial future. He bought several radio stations, including [[KQFN|KNIX (AM)]] (later KCWW) and [[KNIX-FM]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] and [[KUZZ|KUZZ-FM]] in Bakersfield. During the 1990s, Owens was co-owner of the country music network [[Real Country]], of which, the Owens-owned station KCWW was the flagship station.<ref>\"[http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-RandR/1990s/1993/RR-1993-04-30.pdf West, Nicholson Join KNIX, Real Country Network]\", [[Radio & Records]], Issue Number 990.

Duncan, \"American Radio, Volume 23, Issue 1\", (1998) p. 12</ref> and sold KNIX-FM to [[iHeartMedia|Clear Channel Communications]], but he maintained ownership of KUZZ until his death.\n\nOwens established Buck Owens Enterprises and produced records by several artists. He recorded for [[Warner Bros. Records]], but by the 1980s he was no longer recording, instead devoting his time to overseeing his business empire from Bakersfield. He left ''Hee Haw'' in 1986.\n\n===Later career===\nCountry artist [[Dwight Yoakam]] was largely influenced by Owens' style of music and teamed up with him for a duet of \"[[Streets of Bakersfield]]\" in 1988. It was Owens' first No. 1 single in 16 years.  In an interview, Yoakam described the first time he met with Owens:\n<blockquote>\nWe sat there that day in 1987 and talked about my music to that point, my short career, and what I'd been doing and how he'd been watching me.  I was really flattered and thrilled to know that this legend had been keeping an eye on me.<ref>''Back to Buck'' by Chris Neal, ''Country Weekly'', November 19, 2007, p. 43</ref></blockquote>\n\nOwens also collaborated with [[Cledus T. Judd]] on the song \"The First Redneck On The Internet\" in 1998, in which Owens also appears in the music video.\n\nThe 1990s saw a flood of reissues of Owens' Capitol recordings on compact disc, the publishing rights to which Owens had bought back in 1974 as part of his final contract with the label. His albums had been out of print for nearly 15 years when he released a retrospective box set in 1990. Encouraged by brisk sales, Owens struck a distribution deal with [[Sundazed Records]] of New York, which specializes in reissuing obscure recordings. The bulk of his Capitol catalog was reissued on CD in 1995, 1997 and in 2005. Sometime in the 1970s, Owens had also purchased the remaining copies of his original LP albums from Capitol's distribution warehouses across the country. Many of those records (still in the shrinkwrap) were stored by Owens for decades. He often gave them away as gifts and sold them at his nightclub for a premium price some 35 years later.\n\nIn August 1999, Owens brought back together the remaining members of his original Buckaroo Band to help him celebrate his 70th birthday at his [[Buck Owens Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]] in Bakersfield.  Owens, [[Doyle Holly]], [[Tom Brumley]], and Wille Cantu performed old hits from their heyday including \"[[I've Got a Tiger By the Tail]]\" and \"Act Naturally\".\n\nLong before Owens became the famous co-host of ''Hee Haw'', his band became known for their signature Bakersfield sound, later emulated by artists such as [[Merle Haggard]], [[Dwight Yoakam]], and [[Brad Paisley]]. Buck inspired indie country songwriter and friend Terry Fraley, whose band \"The Nudie Cowboys\" possessed a similar sound. This sound was originally made possible with two trademark silver-sparkle [[Fender Telecaster]] guitars, often played simultaneously by Owens and longtime lead guitarist Don Rich. Fender had made a \"Buck Owens signature Telecaster,\" and after his death paid tribute to him.<ref>{{cite web|title=Buck Owens, 1929–2006; Farewell to a legend, an innovator and a dear friend...|publisher=[[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]]|url=http://www.fender.com/news/index.php?display_article=101|access-date=October 1, 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224223851/http://www.fender.com/news/index.php?display_article=101|archive-date=February 24, 2012}}</ref> In 2003, Paisley blended creative styles with this guitar and his own Paisley Telecaster, creating what became known as the Buck-O-Caster. Initially, only two were made; one for Paisley himself and the other presented to Owens during a New Year's celebration that Paisley attended in 2004.\n\nFollowing the death of Rich, Owens' latter trademark became a red, white and blue acoustic guitar, along with a 1974 Pontiac convertible \"Nudiemobile\", adorned with pistols and silver dollars. A similar car, created by [[Nudie Cohn]] for [[Elvis Presley]] and later won by Owens in a bet, is now enshrined behind the bar at Owens' Crystal Palace Nightclub in Bakersfield.\n\nOwens would hand out replicas of his trademark acoustic guitar to friends, acquaintances, and fans. Each would contain a gold plaque with the name of the recipient. Some of these guitars cost $1000 and up.\n\n==Personal life==\nOwens was married four times, three ending in divorce and one in annulment. He married country singer [[Bonnie Owens|Bonnie Campbell Owens]] in 1948.  The couple had two sons, one of whom was Buddy Alan, and separated in 1951, and later divorced.<ref name=Barndance>{{citation|url=http://barndance.blogspot.com/2006/03/bakersfield-californian-article-on.html|title=Bakersfield Californian Article On Buck Owens|publisher=Fresno Barn Dance|author=Price, Robert|access-date=January 29, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1956 Owens married Phyllis Buford with whom he had a third son.<ref name=\"Barndance\"/> In the 1970s he had a relationship with [[Hee Haw]] \"Honey\" Lisa Todd and appeared with her as \"Buck Owens and his gal Lisa\" on the TV game show ''[[Tattletales]]''.\n\nIn 1977 he wed Buckaroos [[fiddle]] player [[Jana Jae|Jana Jae Greif]].

These health problems had forced him to curtail his regular weekly performances with the Buckaroos at his Crystal Palace. Owens died in his sleep of an apparent heart attack at his ranch just north of Bakersfield on March 25, 2006, only hours after performing at his club. He was 76 years old.<ref name=\"Legacy\"/>\n\nOwens was inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] in 1996. He was ranked No. 12 in ''[[Country Music Television|CMT]]'s 40 Greatest Men of Country Music'' in 2003. In addition, CMT also ranked the Buckaroos No. 2 in the network's ''20 Greatest Bands'' in 2005.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} He was also inducted into the [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]].\n\nThe stretch of US Highway 82 in Sherman, Texas, is named the Buck Owens Freeway in his honor.\n\n==Biographies==\nIn November 2013, Buck Owens's posthumous autobiography ''Buck 'Em! The Autobiography of Buck Owens'' by Buck Owens with Randy Poe was released. The book has a foreword by Brad Paisley and a preface by Dwight Yoakam.\n\nIn a 2007 authorized biography ''Buck'', historian Kathryn Burke gives a positive account of Owens.{{sfn|Burke|2007}}\n\nIn ''Buck Owens: The Biography'' (2010) investigative journalist Eileen Sisk offers a critical account of Owens and the shortcomings in his private life.<ref>Gillis, Charlie [http://www.macleans.ca/tag/buck-owens-the-biography/ Review of Eileen Sisk, ''Buck Owens: The Biography''], ''[[Maclean's]]'' magazine, August 19, 2010; 2.macleans.ca</ref>\n\n== Discography ==\n{{main|Buck Owens discography}}\n\n==Covers of Owens songs==\n{{More citations needed section|date=January 2024}}\n* Vocalist–guitarist [[Johnny Rivers]] recorded a rock version of Owens's \"Under Your Spell Again\" on his album ''Meanwhile, Back at the Whiskey A GoGo'' in 1965.\n*Country music singer [[Emmylou Harris]] recorded a version of Owens's \"Together Again\", which was released on her 1976 album ''Elite Hotel''.\n* [[The Beatles]] and, later, [[Ringo Starr]] recorded versions of \"Act Naturally\".
