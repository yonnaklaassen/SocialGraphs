He has also released nine studio albums, mostly in the [[country pop]] vein, with his 1983 album ''Why Lady Why'' having earned a [[gold album|gold]] certification from the [[RIAA]].\n\n==Early life==\nMorris was born in [[Fort Worth, Texas]].<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\" /> He has two siblings, a twin sister, Carey, and a younger brother, Mark. Even though Morris was best known for [[pop (music)|pop]]-oriented hits in the 1980s, he was descended from a long line of traditional [[country music|country]] [[singers]], who sang hard-twang country and also [[gospel music|gospel]].\n\nGary's family moved from Fort Worth to [[North Richland Hills, Texas]] in the late 1950s.<ref>*North Richland Hills, Tex. : CitiCable, [1986]NRH profiles [DVD], Arlita W. Hallam interview.</ref>  Morris, a good athlete, played four sports at [[Richland High School (Texas)|Richland High School]], which led to a scholarship with [[Cisco Junior College]] in [[Texas]]. It was during college that singing became Morris's chosen vocation, and he decided to move to [[Colorado]]. He and his two friends formed a trio, and asked a Colorado Springs bartender if they could get up on the bandstand and perform a few songs, and the audience's response (and tips) convinced Morris to put his college plans on hold and to pursue a performing career.<ref>[{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p31350/biography|pure_url=yes}} Gary Morris Biography], [[AllMusic]]</ref>\n\nIn the early 1970s, Morris made a living by singing in nightclubs in [[Denver, Colorado]].<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> He also wrote a few commercial jingles for [[Frontier Airlines]]. In 1976, Morris signed on with [[Jimmy Carter]]'s presidential campaign and sang at fundraisers during Carter's campaign.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> This job led to Morris' performing at the [[White House]] following Carter's election.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> In the audience was [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] country music producer [[Norro Wilson]], to whom Morris later gave a demo tape.  Wilson liked what he heard, and soon signed Morris to his label [[Warner Bros. Records]].\n\n==Recording career==\nMorris signed his recording contract with Warner Bros. in 1980. After a pair of minor hits landed just inside the top 40 of the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Songs|Hot Country Singles]] chart, he scored his breakthrough hit with \"Headed for a Heartache\";<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> that song reached No. 8 on the country chart in late 1981. Two follow-up singles also reached the top 15.\n\nMorris' 1983 album, ''Why Lady Why'' focused more on ballads. One of the album's four singles was \"[[Wind Beneath My Wings]]\",<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> which showcased Morris' soaring tenor. Written by [[Larry Henley]] and Jeff Silbar, the song about heroes — which Morris recorded as a ballad — became one of the earliest hit versions of the song;<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> a better-known version by [[Bette Midler]] would top the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in 1989. The ''Why Lady Why'' album also featured the ballad \"The Love She Found in Me\",<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> the mid-tempoed \"Velvet Chains\" and the up-tempoed title track as singles; all of them peaked in the top 10 of the ''Billboard'' Hot Country Singles chart. Also during this time, Morris recorded a duet with [[Lynn Anderson]] called \"You're Welcome to Tonight\", which became a top 10 hit.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/>\n\nAfter two more top 10 hits in 1984 — \"Between Two Fires\" and \"Second Hand Heart\" — Morris scored his first No. 1 country hit in March 1985 with \"[[Baby Bye Bye]]\". During what was his most prolific hitmaking part of his career, Morris had three more solo No. 1 hits during the next two years: \"[[I'll Never Stop Loving You (Gary Morris song)|I'll Never Stop Loving You]]\", \"[[100% Chance of Rain]]\" and \"[[Leave Me Lonely (Gary Morris song)|Leave Me Lonely]]\".<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> He also recorded a chart-topping duet with [[Crystal Gayle]], \"[[Makin' Up For Lost Time (The Dallas Lovers Song)]]\".<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> Although he rarely saw any success outside country music, many of Morris' hit songs were in the [[Country music#Country pop|pop-country]] vein during the height of his career.\n\nMorris had two more hits in 1987: the solo \"Plain Brown Wrapper\" and another duet with Gayle called \"[[Another World (Crystal Gayle and Gary Morris song)|Another World]]\". The latter song was used for almost a decade as the theme song for the [[Another World (TV series)|NBC soap opera]].<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> After that, Morris' success on the country charts began to fade, as tastes switched once again to neo-traditional country music. Morris later opened a music publishing office in Nashville, with one of his employees being future star [[Faith Hill]].<ref>Williams, Janet E. (1998). \"Faith Hill\". In ''The Encyclopedia of Country Music''. Paul Kingsbury, Editor. New York: [[Oxford University Press]]. p. 240.</ref>\n\nIn early 2008, Morris released two gospel albums. His most recent CD is called, ''Faith and Freedom,'' dedicated to the military troops. Gary Morris performed two songs featured on [[Juice Newton]]'s album ''Duets: Friends & Memories'', which was released in October 2010.\n\n==Acting career==\nMorris took a break from touring to pursue a serious acting career. One of his first big roles was in the Broadway production of ''[[Les Misérables (musical)|Les Misérables]],'' as [[Jean Valjean]].<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> The full symphonic recording of ''Les Misérables'' is a platinum-selling, [[Grammy Award]]-winning album and features Morris' vocals throughout in the role of Valjean,<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> including his version of the song \"Bring Him Home\".<ref>[http://garymorris.com/bio.html Gary Morris biography at his official website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206063613/http://garymorris.com/bio.html |date=December 6, 2006 }}</ref> Morris has also appeared in a production of Puccini's opera ''[[La Boheme]]'' with fellow country/pop singer [[Linda Ronstadt]].<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/>\n\nIn the 1980s, he did a stint on ''[[The Colbys]]'' as blind country music singer Wayne Masterson,<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> signed to [[Dominique Deveraux]]'s label.  On the show, he sang \"Try Gettin' Over You\" from his ''Anything Goes'' release.\n\nIn the 1990s, he spent a great deal of time working on music projects, such as the [[PBS]] special concert production, in [[Moscow, Russia]], in the [[Tretyakov Gallery]]. He returned to country music in the 1990s, performing in concerts and as a [[record producer]]. Morris hosted and also produced the [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] network's ''The North American Sportsman.'' In 1992, he appeared in an episode of ''Designing Women'' as Julia's surgeon.\n\n==Discography==\n{{Main|Gary Morris discography}}\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n=== American Music Awards ===\n\n{{awards table}}\n|-\n|[[American Music Awards of 1987|1987]]\n|Gary Morris\n|Favorite Country Male Video Artist\n|{{nom}}\n|}\n\n=== Music City News Country Awards ===\n\n{{awards table}}\n|-\n|[[18th Music City News Country Awards|1984]]\n|rowspan=3| Gary Morris\n|Star of Tomorrow\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|[[19th Music City News Country Awards|1985]]\n|rowspan=2| Male Artist of the Year\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|[[20th Music City News Country Awards|1986]]\n|{{nom}}\n|}\n\n=== Academy of Country Music Awards ===\n\n{{awards table}}\n|-\n|[[18th Academy of Country Music Awards|1983]]\n|Gary Morris\n|[[Academy of Country Music Award for New Male Artist of the Year|Top New Male Vocalist]]\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|[[19th Academy of Country Music Awards|1984]]\n|\"[[Wind Beneath My Wings]]\"\n|Song of the Year\n|{{won}}\n|-\n|rowspan=3|[[20th Academy of Country Music Awards|1985]]\n|Gary Morris\n|[[Academy of Country Music Award for Male Artist of the Year|Top Male Vocalist of the Year]]\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|rowspan=2| \"[[Second Hand Heart (Gary Morris song)|Second Hand Heart]]\"\n|Song of the Year\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|Video of the Year\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|rowspan=3| [[21st Academy of Country Music Awards|1986]]\n|Gary Morris\n|Top Male Vocalist of the Year\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|\"[[I'll Never Stop Loving You (Gary Morris song)|I'll Never Stop Loving You]]\"\n|Song of the Year\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|rowspan=2| [[Crystal Gayle]] and Gary Morris\n|rowspan=2| Top Vocal Duo of the Year\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|rowspan=2| [[22nd Academy of Country Music Awards|1987]]\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|\"[[100% Chance of Rain]]\"\n|Video of the Year\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|[[23rd Academy of Country Music Awards|1988]]\n|[[Crystal Gayle]] and Gary Morris\n|Top Vocal Duo of the Year\n|{{nom}}\n|}\n\n=== Country Music Association Awards ===\n\n{{awards table}}\n|-\n|[[1984 Country Music Association Awards|1984]]\n|rowspan=2| Gary Morris\n|rowspan=2| [[Country Music Association Award for Male Vocalist of the Year|Male Vocalist of the Year]]\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|rowspan=2| [[1985 Country Music Association Awards|1985]]\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|\"[[Second Hand Heart (Gary Morris song)|Second Hand Heart]]\"\n|rowspan=2| [[Country Music Association Award for Video of the Year|Music Video of the Year]]\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|rowspan=3| [[1986 Country Music Association Awards|1986]]\n|\"[[100% Chance of Rain]]\"\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|Gary Morris\n|Male Vocalist of the Year\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Gary Morris and [[Crystal Gayle]]\n|rowspan=2|[[Country Music Association Award for Vocal Duo of the Year|Vocal Duo of the Year]]\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|[[1987 Country Music Association Awards|1987]]\n|{{nom}}\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20031224174739/http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/morris_gary/artist.jhtml CMT.com profile]\n*Millard, Bob (1998). \"Gary Morris\".
