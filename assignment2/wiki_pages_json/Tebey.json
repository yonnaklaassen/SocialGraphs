His debut single, \"We Shook Hands (Man to Man)\", hit {{abbr|No.|Number}} 47 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts and remains his only American chart hit.  He has composed several singles for other artists, in addition to releasing music of his own. Tebey has landed seven songs in the top ten of the [[Canada Country]] airplay chart, including the number one hit \"[[Who's Gonna Love You]]\" in 2018.\n\n==Early life==\nHe started singing in church at the age of five and then began to sing at local events. In 1990 and again in 1994, he won the 14-and-under male division of the Canadian Open Country Singing Contest, and in 1996 and 1998, the 18-and-under male division. At 15, he signed a development deal with a major [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] record label and moved to that city with his father, a Nigerian-born electronics engineer, with his mother and siblings staying back at their family home in [[Burlington, Ontario]].\n\nAfter three years, he and his father returned to Burlington. Ottoh was a high school football player at Assumption Catholic High School. But his Nashville career took a belated turn as Ottoh was signed to [[BNA Records]] as a singer and [[Warner Chappell Music]] as a staff songwriter in 2000.  Soon after, he signed fellow Canadian [[Bruce Allen (manager)|Bruce Allen]] as his [[music management|manager]].\n\n==Career==\nIn 2002 and 2003, his performance of \"We Shook Hands (Man to Man)\" became a charted country radio hit in the United States and Canada. Tebey was the subject of a segment on [[CBC Radio]]'s ''[[Sounds Like Canada]]'', and nominated for a 2004 [[Canadian Radio Music Award]] for Best New Group or Solo Artist (Country), against [[Damian Marshall]], [[Deric Ruttan]], Heather Dawn and [[Jason Blaine]].\n\nReturning to Canada, Tebey became a professional songwriter in popular music outside of country.  Artists for whom he has written include Sony BMG recording artist Rex Goudie (including co-writing the No.&nbsp;1 Hot AC single \"Run\"), Shawn Desman (including co-writing his No.&nbsp;1 pop/r&b single \"Let's Go\"), 2006 Canadian Idol winner [[Melissa O'Neil]], Open Road/Universal country Tara Oram and On Ramp/EMI artist Brad Johner.  Tebey also has a co-penned song on Big & Rich's million selling album ''Between Raising Hell and Amazing Grace\" platinum.\n\nAs a country music artist, Tebey has had several hit singles in Canada.  His songs \"Somewhere In The Country\" and \"Till It's Gone\" were Top 10 radio hits in 2012 and 2013 respectively.  In 2014, Tebey's country cover of Avicii's \"[[Wake Me Up (Avicii song)|Wake Me Up]]\" reached No. 5 on the Canadian country music radio airplay chart and has sold in excess of 40,000 copies, being certified Canadian Gold.<ref name=\"MC certs\"/> In 2014 Tebey signed a record deal with Road Angel Entertainment, a sub label of the parent company, [[Warner Music Canada]]. In February 2018 Tebey released the first single \"[[Denim on Denim (song)|Denim on Denim]]\" off his EP ''Love a Girl''.\n\nIn 2019, Tebey launched his own record label, Jayward Artist Group, with management executive Jill Snell.
