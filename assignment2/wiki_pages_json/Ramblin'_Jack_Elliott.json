He attended [[Midwood High School]] in Brooklyn and graduated in 1949. Elliott grew up inspired by the [[rodeo]]s at [[Madison Square Garden]], and wanted to be a cowboy.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Encouraged instead to follow his father's example and become a surgeon, Elliott rebelled, running away from home at the age of 15 to join Col. Jim Eskew's Rodeo,<ref>[http://2talkhorses.com/?p=10031 Colonel Jim Eskew and his Wild West Show in Waverly, NY]</ref> the only rodeo east of the Mississippi. They traveled throughout the Mid-Atlantic states and New England. \n\nElliott was with them for only three months before his parents tracked him down and had him sent home, but he had been exposed to his first singing cowboy, Brahmer Rogers, a rodeo clown who played guitar and five-string banjo, sang songs, and recited poetry. Back home, Elliott taught himself guitar and started [[busking]] for a living. Eventually he got together with [[Woody Guthrie]] and stayed with him as an admirer and student.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> \n{{Quote box\n | quote  =Nobody I know—and I mean nobody—has covered more ground and made more friends and sung more songs than the fellow you're about to meet right now.

By 1960, he had recorded three folk albums for the UK [[record label]] [[Topic Records]]. In London, he played small clubs and pubs by day and [[West End of London|West End]] [[cabaret]] [[nightclub]]s at night. When he returned to the States, Elliott found he had become renowned in American folk music circles.\n\nWoody Guthrie had the greatest influence on Elliott. Guthrie's son, [[Arlo Guthrie|Arlo]], said that because of Woody's [[Huntington's chorea|illness]] and early death, Arlo never really got to know him, but learned his father's songs and performing style from Elliott and, according to Arlo, Woody Guthrie once said that Jack Elliot \"Sounds more like me than I do\".<ref>{{cite magazine | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/ramblin-jack-elliott-interview-bob-dylan-bob-weir-894982/ | title=The Last Folksinger | first=David | last=Browne | date=October 10, 2019 | magazine=Rolling Stone | access-date=September 20, 2024}}</ref>  Elliott's guitar and his mastery of Guthrie's material had a big impact on [[Bob Dylan]] when he lived in Minneapolis.<ref>Dylan paid tribute to Elliott's music in ''[[Chronicles, Vol. 1]]'', pp 250–252</ref> When he reached New York, Dylan was sometimes referred to as the 'son' of Jack Elliott, because Elliott had a way of introducing Dylan's songs with the words: \"Here's a song from my son, Bob Dylan.\" Dylan rose to prominence as a songwriter; Elliott continued as an interpretative troubadour, bringing old songs to new audiences in his idiosyncratic manner. Elliott also influenced [[Phil Ochs]], and played guitar and sang harmony on Ochs's cover of the song \"[[Joe Hill (song)|Joe Hill]]\" from the ''[[Tape from California]]'' album. Elliott also discovered singer-songwriter [[Guthrie Thomas]] in a bar in Northern California in 1973, bringing Thomas to Hollywood, where Thomas's music career began.\n\nElliott appeared in Dylan's 1975–1976 [[Rolling Thunder Revue]] concert tour,<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> and played \"Longheno de Castro\" in Dylan's movie ''[[Renaldo and Clara]]'' accompanied by guitarist [[Arlen Roth]]. In the movie, he sings the song \"South Coast\" by Lillian Bos Ross and Sam Eskin, from whose lyric the character's name is derived.<ref>[http://www.arlo.net/resources/lyrics/south-coast.shtml \"South Coast\" lyrics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205160706/http://arlo.net/resources/lyrics/south-coast.shtml |date=2010-12-05 }} - ''Arlo.net'', Arlo Guthrie's website</ref>\n\n{{blockquote|<poem>\nMy name is Longheno de Castro\nMy father was a Spanish [[grandee]]\nBut I won my wife in a card game\nTo Hell with those lords o'er the sea\n</poem>}}\n\nElliott also appears briefly in the 1983 film ''{{film year|Breathless|1983}}'', starring [[Richard Gere]] and directed by [[Jim McBride]].\n\nElliott plays guitar in both a traditional [[flatpicking]] style and a traditional [[fingerstyle guitar|fingerpicking]] style, depending on the song, which he matches with his laconic, humorous storytelling, often accompanying himself on [[harmonica]]. His singing has a strained, nasal quality which the young Bob Dylan emulated. His repertoire includes American traditional music from various genres, including [[Country music|country]], [[blues]], [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] and folk.\n\nElliott's nickname comes not from his traveling habits, but rather the countless stories he relates before answering the simplest of questions. Folk singer [[Odetta]] claimed that her mother gave him the name, remarking, \"Oh, Jack Elliott, yeah, he can sure ramble on!\"\n\nHis image as a folksy, down-to-earth country boy, despite being a Jewish doctor's son from Brooklyn, and his disdain for other folk singers, were parodied in the fictional documentary ''[[A Mighty Wind]]'' in the character of a former member of the New Main Street Singers, Ramblin' Sandy Pitnick, a somewhat geeky-looking white man in a cowboy hat. The film's central band of folksingers, the Folksmen ([[Christopher Guest]], [[Michael McKean]], and [[Harry Shearer]]), are said to have a scored a hit album called ''Ramblin'.''\n\nElliott's first recording in many years, ''South Coast'', earned him his first [[Grammy Award]] in 1995. He was awarded the [[National Medal of Arts]] in 1998.\n\nHis long career and strained relationship with his daughter Aiyana were chronicled in her 2000 [[film documentary]], ''The Ballad of Ramblin' Jack''.\n\nAt the age of 75, he changed labels and released ''[[I Stand Alone (Ramblin' Jack Elliott album)|I Stand Alone]]'' on the [[ANTI-]] label, with an assortment of guest backup players including members of [[Wilco]], [[X (American band)|X]], and the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]]. The album was produced by [[Ian Brennan (music producer)|Ian Brennan]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2006/music/news/49th-annual-grammy-nominations-list-part-2-1117955272/|title=49th annual Grammy nominations list — part 2|date=2006-12-07|newspaper=Variety|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-04}}</ref> Jack said his intention was to title the album ''Not for the Tourists'', because it was recorded partially in response to his daughter's request for songs he loved but never played in concert. When asked why he did not, he told her, \"These songs are not for the tourists.\"\n\nIn 2012 he was featured on the song \"Double Lifetime\" on the album ''[[Older Than My Old Man Now]]'' by [[Loudon Wainwright III]].\n\nElliott appeared with the Ramblin' Jackernacle Choir, adding vocals, yodels, hollers, to [[Bob Weir|Bob Weir's]] 2016 [[solo album]] ''[[Blue Mountain (Bob Weir album)|Blue Mountain]]'', on the track \"Ki-Yi Bossie\".<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/fall-music-preview-2016-35-must-hear-albums-w438379|title=Fall Music Preview 2016: 35 Must-Hear Albums|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=8 September 2016|access-date=12 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n===Studio===\n*1956: ''[[Woody Guthrie's Blues]]''\n*1957: ''[[Jack Elliot Sings]]''\n*1958: ''[[Jack Takes the Floor]]''\n*1959: ''[[Ramblin' Jack Elliott in London]]'' [[EMI Records]]\n*1960: ''[[Ramblin' Jack Elliott Sings Songs by Woody Guthrie and Jimmie Rodgers]]''\n*1960: ''[[Jack Elliott Sings the Songs of Woody Guthrie]]''\n*1961: ''[[Songs to Grow On by Woody Guthrie, Sung by Jack Elliott]]'' ([[Folkways Records]])\n*1961: ''[[Ramblin' Jack Elliott (album)|Ramblin' Jack Elliott]]'' ([[Prestige Records|Prestige]]/Folklore)\n*1962: ''[[Country Style (Ramblin' Jack Elliott album)|Country Style]]'' ([[Prestige Records|Prestige]]/Folklore)\n*1964: ''[[Jack Elliott (Ramblin' Jack Elliott album)|Jack Elliott]]'' ([[Vanguard Records|Vanguard]])\n*1968: ''[[Young Brigham]]'' ([[Reprise Records|Reprise]])\n*1970: ''[[Bull Durham Sacks & Railroad Tracks]]'' ([[Reprise Records|Reprise]])\n*1981: ''[[Kerouac's Last Dream]]'' (Folk Freak/re-release by Conträr Musik, Germany)\n*1995: ''[[South Coast (album)|South Coast]]'' ([[Red House Records|Red House]])\n*1998: ''[[Friends of Mine (Ramblin' Jack Elliott album)|Friends of Mine]]'' ([[HighTone Records|HighTone]])\n*1999: ''[[The Long Ride]]'' ([[HighTone Records|HighTone]])\n*2006: ''[[I Stand Alone (Ramblin' Jack Elliott album)|I Stand Alone]]'' ([[ANTI-]])\n*2009: ''[[A Stranger Here]]'' ([[ANTI-]])\n\n===Live===\n*1957: ''[[The Lost Topic Tapes: Isle of Wight 1957]]''\n*1962: ''[[Jack Elliott at the Second Fret]]''\n\n===With Derroll Adams===\n*1958: ''[[The Rambling Boys]]''\n*1963: ''Roll On Buddy''\n*1969: ''Folkland Songs''\n*1969: ''Riding in Folkland''\n*1975: ''America''\n\n===Compilations===\n*1963: ''[[Woody Guthrie's Blues|Talking Woody Guthrie]]'' (Topic)\n*1964: ''Muleskinner'' (Topic)\n*1976: ''[[The Essential Ramblin' Jack Elliott]]'' (Vanguard)\n*1989: ''Hard Travelin<nowiki>'</nowiki>'' (reissue of ''Jack Elliott Sings the Songs of Woody Guthrie'' and ''Ramblin' Jack Elliott'')\n*1989: ''Talking Dust Bowl: The Best of Ramblin' Jack Elliott''\n*1990: ''Ramblin' Jack Elliott, Spider John Koerner, U.
