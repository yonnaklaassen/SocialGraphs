Widely cited as one of the most influential songwriters of his generation, Prine was known for his signature blend of humorous lyrics about love, life, and current events, often with elements of [[social commentary]] and [[satire]], as well as sweet songs and melancholy ballads. He was active as a composer, recording artist, live performer, and occasional actor from the early 1970s until his death.\n\nBorn and raised in [[Maywood, Illinois]], Prine learned to play the guitar at age 14. He attended classes at Chicago's [[Old Town School of Folk Music]].<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/oldtownschool/status/989572224213450752 |title=John Prine OTSFM Registration Card |publisher=Old Town School of Folk Music |date=September 17, 1964 |access-date=April 26, 2018}}</ref> After serving in [[West Germany]] with the [[U.S. Army]], he returned to Chicago in the late 1960s, where he worked as a mailman, writing and singing songs first as a hobby. Continuing studies at the Old Town School, he performed at a student hang-out, the nearby Fifth Peg. A laudatory review by [[Roger Ebert]] put Prine on the map. Singer-songwriter [[Kris Kristofferson]] heard Prine at [[Steve Goodman]]'s insistence, and Kristofferson invited Prine to be his opening act. Prine released his [[John Prine (album)|eponymous debut album]] in 1971.<ref>{{cite magazine | url=https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/john-prine-songwriters-hall-of-fame-interview-8515459/ | title=John Prine Shares the Remarkable 'Cinderella Story' of How His Career Got Started | magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] }}</ref> Featuring such songs as [[Paradise (John Prine song)|\"Paradise\"]], [[Sam Stone (song)|\"Sam Stone\"]] and \"[[Angel from Montgomery]]\", it has been hailed as one of the greatest of all albums.<ref>{{Cite web |title=#149 John Prine, 'John Prine' (1971) |url=https://www.rs500albums.com/150-101/149 |access-date=2023-10-10 |website=Rolling Stone 500 Greatest Albums Of All Time |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nThe acclaim Prine earned from his debut led to three more albums for Atlantic. ''[[Common Sense (John Prine album)|Common Sense]]'' (1975) was his first to chart on the Billboard U.S. Top 100. He then recorded three albums with [[Asylum Records]]. In 1981, he co-founded [[Oh Boy Records]], an independent label which released all of his music up until his death. His final album, 2018's ''[[The Tree of Forgiveness]]'', debuted at #5 on the [[Billboard 200]], his highest ranking on the charts.\n\nPrine struggled with health issues throughout his life, surviving cancer twice. He died in 2020 from complications caused by {{nowrap|[[COVID-19]]}}. Earlier the same year, he received the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]].\n\n==Early life==\nPrine was the son of William Mason Prine, a [[Tool and die maker|tool-and-die]] maker, and Verna Valentine (Hamm), a homemaker, both originally from [[Muhlenberg County, Kentucky]].

In the audience was [[Jerry Wexler]], who signed Prine to [[Atlantic Records]] the next day.<ref name=\"Betts\"/> The album included Prine's signature songs \"Illegal Smile\" and [[Sam Stone (song)|\"Sam Stone\"]]. \"Sam Stone\" is about the trauma of a Vietnam veteran. He explained in 2011: <blockquote>I knew there were a lot of GIs out there, who came out of the war and they weren’t quite right. … I knew there were homes where nobody was talking to each other, which became \"[[Angel from Montgomery]]\". … I knew there were kids who didn’t have fathers, and nobody ever acknowledged it, which became \"6 O’Clock News.\"… I saw all that.

The album also featured \"Hello in There\", a song about aging that was later covered by numerous artists, and \"Far From Me\", a lonely [[waltz]] about lost love for a waitress, which Prine later said was his favorite of all his songs. The album received many positive reviews, and some hailed Prine as \"the next Dylan\". Bob Dylan himself appeared unannounced at one of Prine's first New York City club appearances, anonymously backing him on harmonica.<ref name=\"Huffman\">{{cite book |last1=Huffman |first1=Eddie |title=John Prine: In Spite of Himself |date=2015 |publisher=[[University of Texas Press]] |isbn=9780292748224 |pages=69–70 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zcAvBgAAQBAJ |access-date=April 7, 2020 |quote=''Rolling Stone'' caught up with Prine in New York shortly before the album's release [referring to ''Diamonds in the Rough''].

The 'nervously nondescript figure' who joined him was none other than Bob Dylan.}}</ref>\n\nPrine's second album, ''[[Diamonds in the Rough (album)|Diamonds in the Rough]]'' (1972), was a surprise for many after the critical success of his first LP; it was an uncommercial, stripped-down affair that reflected Prine's fondness for [[bluegrass music]] and features songs reminiscent of [[Hank Williams]]. Highlights of the compilation include the allegorical \"[[The Great Compromise (song)|The Great Compromise]]\", which includes a recitation and addresses the [[Vietnam War]], and the ballad \"Souvenirs\", which Prine later recorded with Goodman.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Looking Back on John Prine Buddy Steve Goodman |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/looking-back-on-john-prine-buddy-steve-goodman-860284/ |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=July 19, 2019  |access-date=April 8, 2020}}</ref>\n\nHis subsequent albums from the 1970s include ''[[Sweet Revenge (John Prine album)|Sweet Revenge]]'' (1973), containing such fan favorites as \"Dear Abby\", \"Grandpa Was a Carpenter\", and \"Christmas in Prison\", and [[Common Sense (John Prine album)|''Common Sense'']] (1975), with \"Come Back to Us Barbara Lewis Hare Krishna Beauregard\". The latter album was Prine's first to chart on the U.S.\nTop 100 by ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' and reflected his growing commercial success. It was produced by Steve Cropper. ''[[Bruised Orange]]'' (1978) is a Steve Goodman–produced album that gave listeners songs such as \"That's The Way That The World Goes 'Round\", \"Sabu Visits the Twin Cities Alone\", \"Fish and Whistle\", and the title track.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Cocks |first1=Jay |title=Bruised Orange |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/bruised-orange-190100/ |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=September 7, 1978  |access-date=April 8, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 1974, singer [[David Allan Coe]] achieved considerable success on the country charts with \"[[You Never Even Called Me by My Name]]\", co-written by Prine and Goodman. The song good-naturedly spoofs stereotypical country music lyrics to create what it calls \"the perfect country and western song\". Prine refused to take a songwriter's credit (stating he was too drunk when the song was written to remember what he had contributed) and Goodman received sole credit.
