Davis was with Boots for several years in the late 1960s. During his time there, he played on many of Sinatra's recordings, and she worked him into her stage shows. Boots Enterprises also acted as Davis's publishing company, publishing songs such as \"In the Ghetto\", \"Friend, Lover, Woman, Wife\", \"Home\", and \"[[Memories (Elvis Presley song)|Memories]]\", which were recorded by [[Elvis Presley]], [[Nancy Sinatra]], [[B. J. Thomas]] and many others. During a short timespan Davis used the pseudonym \"Scott Davis\" for songwriting purposes (borrowing from the given name of his son) to avoid confusion with renowned songwriter [[Mack David]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.elvisinfonet.com/interview_mac_davis.html|title=Elvis Information Network - Mac Davis Interview|publisher=elvisinfonet.com|access-date=21 October 2021}}</ref> Davis left Boots Enterprises in 1970 to sign with [[Columbia Records]], taking all of his songs with him.<ref name=\"Newman\"/><ref name=\"Ososeje\"/><ref name=\"Wood\"/>\n\nOne of the songs he wrote in 1968, called \"A Little Less Conversation\", was recorded by Elvis Presley (and became a posthumous success for Presley years later). Presley also recorded Davis's \"In the Ghetto\" in sessions in Memphis. Mac Davis eventually recorded the tune after Presley's version became a success, and was released in a Ronco In Concert compilation in 1975. Presley continued to record more of Davis's material, such as \"Memories\", \"Don't Cry Daddy\", and \"Clean Up Your Own Backyard\". [[Bobby Goldsboro]] also recorded some of Davis's songs, including \"[[Watching Scotty Grow]]\",<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> which became a No. 1 [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]] success for Goldsboro in 1971. Other artists who recorded his material included [[Vikki Carr]], [[O.C. Smith]], and [[Kenny Rogers]] and [[The First Edition (band)|The First Edition]]. \"I Believe in Music\", often considered to be Davis's [[signature song]], was recorded by several artists (including Marian Love, B.J. Thomas, [[Louis Jordan]], [[Perry Como]], [[Helen Reddy]], [[Lynn Anderson]], and Davis himself) before it finally became a success in 1972 for the group [[Gallery (band)|Gallery]].<ref name=\"Newman\"/><ref name=\"Ososeje\"/><ref name=\"Wood\"/>\n\nDuring the 1970s, many of his songs \"crossed over\", successfully scoring on both the country and popular music charts, including \"Baby Don't Get Hooked on Me\"<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> (a number one Grammy-nominated success), \"[[One Hell of a Woman]]\" (pop no. 11), and \"[[Stop and Smell the Roses (song)|Stop and Smell the Roses]]\" (a no. 9 pop hit).<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Also, during the 1970s and 1980s, he was very active as an actor, appearing in several movies, including 1979's ''North Dallas Forty'', as well as hosting a successful variety show.[3][4][5] In 2010, Davis co-wrote the song \"Time Flies\" with Rivers Cuomo which appeared on Weezer's Hurley album.

After several years of writing songs for other artists, he was signed by Clive Davis for Columbia, later topping the Country and Pop charts with the song \"Baby Don't Get Hooked on Me\" in 1972. It sold over one million copies and was awarded a gold disc by the Recording Industry Association of America in September 1972 [[Recording Industry Association of America]] in September 1972.<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\">{{cite book| first=Joseph| last=Murrells| year=1978| title=The Book of Golden Discs| edition=2nd| publisher=Barrie and Jenkins Ltd| location=London| page=[https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/310 310]| isbn=978-0214204807| url-access=registration| url=https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/310}}</ref>\n\nIn 1974, Davis was awarded the [[Academy of Country Music]]'s Entertainer of the Year award.

At the end of the 1970s, he was signed by Neil Bogart and moved to Casablanca Records, which was best known at the time for its successes with disco star Donna Summer and rock'n'roll band Kiss. His first success for the company in 1980 was the novelty song \"[[It's Hard to Be Humble]]\", a light-hearted look at how popularity and good looks could go to one's head. The song became his first Country music top 10 and a rare top 30 hit in the UK. (It was translated into Dutch as \"''Het is moeilijk bescheiden te blijven''\" and became a hit for the Dutch singer Peter Blanker in 1981). Later that year, he had another top 10 song with \"Let's Keep It That Way\" written by Curly Putman and Rafe Van Hoy. In November, \"Rock 'N' Roll (I Gave You the Best Years of My Life)\" was played by [[KHJ (AM)|KHJ]] in Los Angeles as its last song before it switched from Top 40 to Country music.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://formatchange.com/khj-goes-country/ |title=KHJ Goes Country |date=November 8, 1980 |publisher=Formatchange.com |access-date=August 26, 2015}}</ref> He achieved success with other songs like \"Texas in My Rear View Mirror\" and \"Hooked on Music\", which became his biggest Country music success in 1981 going to number 2.
