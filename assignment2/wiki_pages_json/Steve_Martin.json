He became one of the most popular U.S. stand-up comedians during the 1970s, performing his brand of offbeat, [[Surreal humour|absurdist]] comedy routines before sold-out theaters on national tours. Martin went on to star in  film roles, including such films as ''[[The Jerk]]'' (1979), ''[[Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid]]'' (1982), ''[[The Man with Two Brains]]'' (1983), ''[[All of Me (1984 film)|All of Me]]'' (1984), ''[[Three Amigos|¡Three Amigos!]]'' (1986), ''[[Planes, Trains and Automobiles]]'' (1987), ''[[Dirty Rotten Scoundrels (film)|Dirty Rotten Scoundrels]]'' (1988), ''[[L.A.

Martin has stated in several interviews and in his memoir, ''Born Standing Up'', that he used to take 33 rpm [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] records and slow them down to 16 rpm and tune his banjo down, so the notes would sound the same. Martin was able to pick out each note and perfect his playing.{{Citation needed|reason=|date=October 2020}} Martin learned how to play the banjo with help from [[John McEuen]], who later joined the [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]]. McEuen's brother later managed Martin as well as the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. Martin did his stand-up routine opening for the band in the early 1970s. He had the band play on his hit song \"King Tut\", being credited as \"The Toot Uncommons\" (as in [[Tutankhamun]]).{{Citation needed|reason=|date=October 2020}} The banjo was a staple of Martin's 1970s stand-up career, and he periodically poked fun at his love for the instrument.<ref name=\"Smithsonian\"/> On the ''[[Comedy Is Not Pretty!]]'' album, he included an all-instrumental jam, titled \"Drop Thumb Medley\", and played the track on his 1979 concert tour. His final comedy album, ''[[The Steve Martin Brothers]]'' (1981), featured one side of Martin's typical stand-up material, with the other side featuring live performances of Steve playing banjo with a bluegrass band.\n\nIn 2001, he played banjo on [[Earl Scruggs]]'s remake of \"[[Foggy Mountain Breakdown]]\". The recording was the winner of the [[Grammy Award for Best Country Instrumental Performance|Best Country Instrumental Performance]] category at the [[Grammy Awards of 2002]]. In 2008, Martin appeared with the band, In the Minds of the Living, during a show in [[Myrtle Beach, South Carolina]].<ref>[https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/10/06/steve-martin-plays-the-ba_n_310858.html \"Steve Martin Plays The Banjo Really Well (Video)\"].
