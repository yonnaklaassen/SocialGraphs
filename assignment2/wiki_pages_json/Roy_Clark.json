He is best known for having hosted ''[[Hee Haw]]'', a nationally televised country variety show, from 1969 to 1997. Clark was an important and influential figure in [[country music]], both as a performer and in helping to popularize the genre.\n\nDuring the 1970s, Clark frequently guest-hosted for [[Johnny Carson]] on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' and enjoyed a 30-million viewership for ''Hee Haw''. Clark was highly regarded and renowned as a guitarist, [[banjo]] player, and [[fiddle]]r.  He was skilled in the traditions of many genres, including classical guitar, country music, [[Latin music]], [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]], and pop.  He had hit songs as a pop vocalist (e.g., \"[[Hier encore|Yesterday, When I Was Young]]\" and \"Thank God and Greyhound\"), and his instrumental skill had an enormous effect on generations of [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] and country musicians. He became a member of the [[Grand Ole Opry]] in 1987, and, in 2009, was inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum|Country Music Hall of Fame]]. He published his autobiography, ''My Life—in Spite of Myself'', in 1994.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-671-86434-7 |title=Nonfiction Book Review: 'My Life in Spite of Myself' |date=February 28, 1994 |magazine=[[Publishers Weekly]] |access-date=June 9, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nClark was born April 15, 1933, in [[Meherrin, Virginia]],{{sfn|''Current Biography Yearbook''|1979|page=83}} one of five children<ref name=Thanki>{{cite news| url=https://www.tennessean.com/story/entertainment/music/2018/11/15/roy-clark-dead-85/1978910002/| title=Roy Clark, 'Hee Haw' co-host, Country Music Hall of Fame member, dies at 85| last=Thanki| first=Juli| newspaper=[[The Tennessean]]| location=Nashville| access-date=June 9, 2020}}</ref> born to Hester Linwood Clark and Lillian Clark (Oliver).{{sfn|Flint|Nelson|1993|page=57}} His father was a tobacco farmer.{{sfn|Flint|Nelson|1993|page=57}} He spent his childhood in Meherrin and New York City, where his father moved the family to take jobs during the [[Great Depression]].{{sfn|Kingsbury|2004|page=95}} When Clark was 11 years old, his family moved to a home on 1st Street SE in the [[Washington Highlands, Washington, D.C.|Washington Highlands]] neighborhood of Washington, D.C.,{{sfn|Clark|Eliot|1994|page=84}} after his father found work at the [[Washington Navy Yard]].{{sfn|Lornell|2012|page=369}}\n\nClark's father was a semi-professional musician who played [[banjo]], [[violin|fiddle]], and guitar,{{sfn|Kingsbury|2004|page=95}} and his mother played piano.{{sfn|Flint|Nelson|1993|page=57}} The first musical instrument Clark ever played was a four-string cigar box with a ukulele neck attached to it,{{sfn|Flint|Nelson|1993|page=57}} which he picked up in elementary school.<ref name=rcinterview>{{cite magazine| title=The Roy Clark Interview| magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]| date=December 28, 1985| pages=RC-4, RC-12| access-date=November 15, 2018| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uyQEAAAAMBAJ&q=%22Roy%20Clark%22%20%22National%20Banjo%20Championship%22&pg=PT77}}</ref> His father taught Clark to play guitar{{sfn|Flint|Nelson|1993|page=57}} when Roy was 14 years old, and soon Clark was playing banjo, guitar, and [[mandolin]].{{sfn|Lornell|2012|page=369}} \"Guitar was my real love, though,\" Clark later said. \"I never copied anyone, but I was certainly influenced by them; especially by [[George Barnes (musician)|George Barnes]].

And I used to go in and just steal them blind. I stole all their licks. It wasn't until years later that I found out that a lot of them used to cringe and say 'Oh, no!

[[Country-western]] music was widely derided by Clark's schoolmates, leaving him socially isolated. Clowning around, he felt, helped him to fit in again. Clark used humor as a musician as well, and it was not until the mid 1960s that he felt confident enough to perform in public without using humor in his act.<ref name=rcinterview />\n\nThe D.C. area had a number of country-western music venues at the time.
