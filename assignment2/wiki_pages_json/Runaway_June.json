Wayne co-founded the group in 2015 with Hannah Mulholland (mandolin, vocals) and Naomi Cooke (lead vocals). Wayne was a former member of [[Stealing Angels]] and had co-written singles for other singers prior to the group's foundation. Signed to [[BBR Music Group]]'s Wheelhouse imprint in 2015, the group charted two singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] and [[Country Airplay]] charts prior to their breakthrough hit \"[[Buy My Own Drinks]]\" in 2018. This was the first of three singles from their 2019 studio album ''[[Blue Roses (Runaway June album)|Blue Roses]]''. Mulholland quit the group in 2020 and was replaced by Natalie Stovall, former lead singer of [[Natalie Stovall and the Drive]]; Cooke quit in 2022 and was replaced by Stevie Woodward.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Runaway June performing at Camp Schwab Festival.jpg|thumb|Runaway June performing at the [[Camp Schwab]] Festival in March 2023]]\nJennifer Wayne, a granddaughter of [[John Wayne]], grew up in southern California, and Hannah Mulholland grew up in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], while Naomi Cooke is from Cedar Key, Florida.
