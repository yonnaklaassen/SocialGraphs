Between 1995 and 1998, he recorded for [[Giant Records (Warner)|Giant Records]], for which he released three studio albums: ''[[Daryle Singletary (album)|Daryle Singletary]]'' in 1995, ''[[All Because of You (Daryle Singletary album)|All Because of You]]'' in 1996 and ''[[Ain't It the Truth]]'' in 1998. In the same timespan, Singletary entered the Top 40 of the [[Hot Country Songs]] charts five times, reaching No. 2 with \"[[I Let Her Lie]]\" and \"[[Amen Kind of Love]]\", and No. 4 with \"[[Too Much Fun (song)|Too Much Fun]]\".\n\nIn 2000, Singletary switched to Audium Entertainment (a division of Koch Entertainment), where he released the albums ''[[Now and Again (Daryle Singletary album)|Now and Again]]'' (2000) and ''[[That's Why I Sing This Way]]'' (2002), both of which were largely composed of [[cover song]]s. A third album of covers, 2007's ''[[Straight from the Heart (Daryle Singletary album)|Straight from the Heart]]'', was issued on the independent [[Shanachie Records]] label. He returned to [[E1 Music]] in 2010, to release ''[[Rockin' in the Country]]''.\n\n==Early life==\nDaryle Singletary was born March 10, 1971, in [[Cairo, Georgia]].<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/daryle-singletary-mn0000573100/biography|title=Daryle Singletary biography|last=Ankeny|first=Jason|work=[[Allmusic]]|access-date=October 1, 2018}}</ref> His father, Roger Singletary,<ref name=\"Te\"/> was a postal worker, while his mother, Anita,<ref name=\"Te\"/> was a hair dresser.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Betts |first1=Stephan |title=Daryle Singletary, Nineties Honky-Tonk Singer, Dead at 46 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/daryle-singletary-nineties-honky-tonk-singer-dead-at-46-204232/ |access-date=18 November 2018 |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=February 2, 2018}}</ref> At an early age, he sang [[gospel music]] with his cousins and brother. Later on, in high school, he began taking vocal classes as well. In 1990, he moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], in pursuit of a record deal.<ref name=\"Te\">{{cite news |url=https://www.tennessean.com/story/entertainment/music/2018/02/12/daryle-singletary-dead-46/328887002/|title=Country singer Daryle Singletary dead at 46 |newspaper=[[The Tennessean]] |date=February 12, 2018 |last=Thanki |first=Juli}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Nashville]], he found work singing during open-mic nights at various venues, before finding work as a demo singer. One of the demos that Singletary sang was \"An Old Pair of Shoes\", which [[Randy Travis]] eventually recorded.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> Travis recommended Singletary to his management team, who helped him sign to a recording contract with [[Giant Records (Warner Bros. subsidiary label)|Giant Records]].<ref name=\"allmusic\"/>\n\n==Career==\n===1995–1996: ''Self-titled album''===\nSingletary's self-titled [[Daryle Singletary (album)|debut album]] was released in 1995. The lead-off single, \"I'm Living Up to Her Low Expectations\", spent one week in the Top 40 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country charts, peaking at No.&nbsp;39. It was followed by his biggest hit, the No.&nbsp;2 \"I Let Her Lie\". This album also produced the No.&nbsp;4 \"[[Too Much Fun (song)|Too Much Fun]]\" and finally \"Working It Out\" at No.&nbsp;50. Despite the two Top Five hits it produced, the album sold poorly and reached No.&nbsp;44 on [[Top Country Albums]]. The album was produced by [[David Malloy]], [[James Stroud]] and [[Randy Travis]].\n\n===1996–1997: ''All Because of You''===\nA second album for Giant, ''[[All Because of You (Daryle Singletary album)|All Because of You]]'', was released in 1996. Although its lead-off single \"Amen Kind of Love\" became his second No.&nbsp;2 hit that year, the album's other two tracks — \"The Used to Be's\" and \"Even the Wind\" — both fell short of Top 40, peaking at number 48 and 68 respectively.\n\n===1998–1999: ''Ain't It the Truth''===\n''[[Ain't It the Truth]]'', his third and final album for Giant, produced a minor hit in \"[[The Note (song)|The Note]]\", which peaked at No.&nbsp;28 on the country charts and No.&nbsp;90 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Despite this song's minor crossover success, however, this album also saw its second and third singles miss the Top 40, and Singletary was dropped from Giant's roster.\n\n===2000–2001: ''Now and Again''===\nIn 2000, Singletary signed to Audium/Koch Entertainment to release his fourth album, 2000's ''Now and Again''. This album's lead-off single was a cover of [[Savage Garden]]'s 1999 pop single \"[[I Knew I Loved You (Savage Garden song)|I Knew I Loved You]]\". Following it were \"I've Thought of Everything\" at No.&nbsp;70, and the album's title track, which failed to chart.\n\n===2002–2003: ''That's Why I Sing This Way''===\nHis second album for Audium/Koch, ''That's Why I Sing This Way'', was mostly a cover album save for the title track. Both \"That's Why I Sing This Way\" and a cover of [[Conway Twitty]]'s \"I'd Love to Lay You Down\" were released from this album, respectively reaching No.&nbsp;47 and No.&nbsp;43.\n\n===2003–2018: Later years===\nAfter Audium/Koch closed its country division, Singletary signed to [[Shanachie Records]]. His first project for the label was a second album, 2007's ''Straight from the Heart'', which was also largely composed of cover songs. Its singles, \"I Still Sing This Way\" and \"Jesus & Bartenders\", both failed to chart.\n\nIn 2009, Singletary returned to Koch under the label's new name of E1 Music. He released his next single, \"Love You With the Lights On\" in February. The single was the lead-off single to a new album, ''Rockin' in the Country'', released in June 2009.\n\n==Death==\nSingletary died unexpectedly at his home in Lebanon, Tennessee,<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> on the morning of February 12, 2018. The cause of death was not revealed.<ref>{{cite news |last=Fernandez |first=Matt|title=Country Singer Daryle Singletary Dies at 46|url=https://variety.com/2018/music/news/country-singer-daryle-singletary-dead-dies-at-46-1202695314/|date=February 12, 2018 |access-date=February 12, 2018 |publisher=Variety}}</ref> Later that same year, Platinum Records Nashville released a posthumous single titled \"She's Been Cheatin' on Us\". Although the label announced that the song's proceeds were to benefit his family, a representative of the singer stated that no such fund existed, and that the recording was a demo that was never meant to be released.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theboot.com/daryle-singletary-last-song-cease-and-desist/|title=POSTHUMOUSLY RELEASED DARYL SINGLETARY SONG CAUSES LEGAL DRAMA|last=Stecker|first=Liv|work=The Boot|date=16 February 2018 |access-date=19 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!
