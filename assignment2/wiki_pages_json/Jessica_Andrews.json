At age 15<!--see talk page--> in mid-1999, she made her debut on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now [[Hot Country Songs]]) charts with the single \"I Will Be There for You\", from her debut album ''[[Heart Shaped World (Jessica Andrews album)|Heart Shaped World]]'', released in 1999 on [[DreamWorks Records]] Nashville. Andrews had her biggest chart success in 2001 with the song \"[[Who I Am (Jessica Andrews song)|Who I Am]]\", a No.&nbsp;1 country hit and the title track of her [[Who I Am (Jessica Andrews album)|second studio album]], which was certified gold in the United States. A third album, ''[[Now (Jessica Andrews album)|Now]]'' was released in 2003 to lower sales, while a fourth album (tentatively titled ''Ain't That Life'') was never released due to DreamWorks' closure. In late 2008, Andrews signed to Carolwood Records, an imprint of [[Lyric Street Records]], however, she was dropped from the label in 2009 without issuing an album. Andrews has been married to Nashville songwriter [[Marcel (singer)|Marcel]] since 2011.\n\n==Early life==\nJessica Danielle Andrews was born in [[Huntingdon, Tennessee]], to parents Jessie and Vicki Andrews.<ref name=\"price\">{{cite magazine |last1=Price |first1=Deborah Evans |title=Teen Jessica Andrews Greets 'World' |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kw4EAAAAMBAJ&q=%22Teen+Jessica+Andrews+Greets%22&pg=PA35 |access-date=9 June 2019 |date=6 February 1999 |magazine=Billboard |volume=111 |issue=6 |page=35}}</ref><ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p359529|pure_url=yes}} |title=Jessica Andrews biography |access-date=April 13, 2008 |last=Phares |first=Heather |work=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> When she was seven, a bone was growing through her spinal cord, a condition that required surgery.
