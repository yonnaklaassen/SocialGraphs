Initially, Gayle's management and record label were the same as that of her oldest sister, [[Loretta Lynn]].  Not finding success with the arrangement after several years, and with Lynn's encouragement, Gayle decided to try a different approach. She signed a new record contract and began recording with Nashville producer [[Allen Reynolds]]. Gayle's new sound was sometimes referred to as [[Middle of the road (music)|middle-of-the-road]] (MOR) or [[country pop]], and was part of a bigger musical trend by many country artists of the 1970s to appeal to a wider audience. Subsequently, Gayle became one of the most successful [[crossover music|crossover]] artists of the 1970s and 80s.<ref name=\"You Don't Know Me\">{{cite magazine |last1=Betts |first1=Stephen L. |title=Crystal Gayle Sings With Loretta Lynn, Interprets Country Staples on 'You Don't Know Me' |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/crystal-gayle-loretta-lynn-you-dont-know-me-album-904127/ |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=26 October 2019 |access-date=30 December 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Taste of Country\">{{cite web |title=Country Music's Most Powerful Women |url=https://tasteofcountry.com/crystal-gayle-powerful-female-country-singers/ |website=[[Townsquare Media#Web publications and services|Taste of Country]] |date=10 September 2017 |access-date=30 December 2019}}</ref> She is known for her floor-length hair.<ref name=\"Three Good Reasons\">{{cite web |title=SHORT TAKES: Hair Harasses Crystal Gayle |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-09-19-ca-874-story.html |website=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=19 September 1990 |access-date=1 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nGayle was said to have begun her career in the 1960s performing as a background singer in Lynn's band (although Gayle says this actually never happened).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Country music icon Crystal Gayle blows through Texas once again for renewed tour |url=https://sanantonio.culturemap.com/news/entertainment/country-music-icon-crystal-gayle-blows-through-texas-once-again-renewed-tour/ |access-date=2022-04-15 |website=CultureMap San Antonio |language=en}}</ref> Lynn helped her sign a recording contract with [[Decca Records]] in 1970. Having minor success, she was encouraged to develop her own musical identity. Under the direction of producer Reynolds at [[United Artists Records]], Gayle shifted towards a [[country pop]] style that was more successful. In 1975, \"[[Wrong Road Again]]\" became Gayle's first major hit. However, it was in 1977 when Gayle achieved her biggest success with \"Don't It Make My Brown Eyes Blue\". The single topped the ''Billboard'' country chart, crossed over to the top five of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and became a major international hit.\n\nGayle continued having success from the late 1970s and through late 1980s. Her biggest hits included \"[[Ready for the Times to Get Better]]\" (1977), \"[[Talking in Your Sleep (Crystal Gayle song)|Talking in Your Sleep]]\" (1978), \"[[Half the Way]]\" (1979) and \"[[You and I (Eddie Rabbitt and Crystal Gayle song)|You and I]]\" (1982). In the 1990s, Gayle shifted artistic directions by recording various genres of music. This included an album of [[inspirational music]] titled ''[[Someday (Crystal Gayle album)|Someday]]'' (1995) and an album of standards called ''[[Crystal Gayle Sings the Heart and Soul of Hoagy Carmichael]]'' (1999). During the decade she also owned and operated a fine arts shop called Crystal's Fine Gifts and Jewelry. Her most recent studio release was in 2019 and Gayle has since continued to tour throughout the world.\n\nGayle has won one [[Grammy Award]] and has been nominated for several others since the 1970s. She has also won five [[Academy of Country Music]] awards; those awards include receiving the Cliffie Stone Pioneer Award in 2016. In addition, she has won two [[Country Music Association]] awards and three [[American Music Awards]]. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked her among the 100 greatest country artists of all time and [[CMT (American TV channel)|CMT]] ranked her within their list of the 40 greatest women of country music.

Upon signing with Decca, the label insisted that Gayle change her first name from \"Brenda\" to another name. The conflict was due to the fact that [[Brenda Lee]] was already signed to Decca at the time. Shortly thereafter, Lynn drove past a sign for the [[Krystal (restaurant)|Krystal]] fast-food restaurant and said to Gayle, \"That's your name.

However it was Lynn that encouraged Gayle to develop a unique style.
