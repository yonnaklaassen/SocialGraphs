From 1994 until his departure in 2007, he was the lead singer of the group [[Lonestar]], which recorded seven studio albums on [[BNA Records]] during his tenure as lead vocalist. For the first seven years of the band's existence, he alternated with then-bassist [[John Rich]] as vocalist. McDonald became the sole lead vocalist of Lonestar following Rich's departure. McDonald co-wrote several of the band's singles, and sang lead on all but one of them; he would rejoin the band in 2011 before exiting again in 2021 to perform with [[The Frontmen]]. Outside Lonestar, he has charted twice as a guest vocalist on others' songs, in addition to releasing two independent albums and four solo singles.\n\n==Biography==\nRichie McDonald was born on February 6, 1962, in [[Lubbock, Texas]]<ref name=\"Country Encyclopedia\">{{cite book |title=Country Music: The Encyclopedia |last=Stambler |first=Irwin |author2=Lyndon Stambler |author3=Grelun Landon  |date=14 July 2000 |pages=257 |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=9780312264871 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d18K8QWcEo8C&dq=%22richie+mcdonald%22+1962&pg=PA257}}</ref> He was asked to join the band Lonestar by founding member Dean Sams in 1992.<ref>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p165799/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Lonestar biography|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|work=[[Allmusic]]|access-date=12 February 2010}}</ref> He served as the band's lead vocalist, with other members comprising bass guitarist [[John Rich (musician)|John Rich]] (who left in 1998 and was never officially replaced), drummer Keech Rainwater, keyboardist, guitarist, vocals and founding member Dean Sams and guitarist, vocals Michael Britt.
