The next year's follow-up album, ''[[Desperado (Eagles album)|Desperado]]'', peaked at only number 41 in the US, although [[Desperado (Eagles song)|the title song]] became a popular track. In 1974, guitarist [[Don Felder]] joined, and ''[[On the Border]]'' produced the top-40 hit \"[[Already Gone (Eagles song)|Already Gone]]\" and the Eagles' first number-one song in the US and Canada, \"[[Best of My Love (Eagles song)|Best of My Love]]\", which made the top 15 in Australia, their first hit overseas. In 1975, the album ''[[One of These Nights]]'' became their first number-one album in the US and a top ten album in many countries. It included the US number-one hit \"[[One of These Nights (Eagles song)|One of These Nights]]\", which was their first top ten hit outside of North America, and US top-5 songs \"[[Lyin' Eyes]]\" and \"[[Take It to the Limit (Eagles song)|Take It to the Limit]]\".

The album yielded two number-one singles in the US and Canada, \"[[New Kid in Town]]\" and \"[[Hotel California]]\", the latter of which became their only top-10 hit in the United Kingdom, while also reaching the top ten in New Zealand and many European countries, including number two in France.\n\nMeisner was replaced by [[Timothy B. Schmit]] in 1977. The Eagles released their last studio album for nearly 28 years in 1979 with ''[[The Long Run (album)|The Long Run]]'', spawning the North American number-one song \"[[Heartache Tonight]]\", which became their biggest hit in Australia (number 13), and the North American top-10 hits \"[[The Long Run (song)|The Long Run]]\" and \"[[I Can't Tell You Why]]\". The Eagles broke up in 1980 but reunited in 1994 for the album ''[[Hell Freezes Over]]'', a mix of live and new studio tracks, and toured consistently. In 2007, the Eagles released ''[[Long Road Out of Eden]]'', their sixth number-one album in the US, and in 2008 launched the [[Long Road Out of Eden Tour]]. In 2013, they began the extended [[History of the Eagles – Live in Concert|History of the Eagles Tour]] in conjunction with the documentary release, ''[[History of the Eagles]]''.

The album took two years to complete. It was originally intended to be a double album, but the band members were unable to write enough songs. ''The Long Run'' was released on September 24, 1979. Considered a disappointment by some critics for failing to live up to ''Hotel California'', it proved a huge commercial hit nonetheless; the album topped the charts and sold seven million copies. In addition, it included three Top 10 singles. \"[[Heartache Tonight]]\" became their last single to top the Hot 100, on November 10, 1979. The [[The Long Run (song)|title track]] and \"[[I Can't Tell You Why]]\" both reached number 8. The band won their fourth Grammy for \"Heartache Tonight\". \"[[In the City (Joe Walsh song)|In the City]]\" by Walsh and \"The Sad Cafe\" became live staples. The band also recorded two Christmas songs during these sessions, \"Funky New Year\" and \"[[Please Come Home for Christmas]]\", which was released as a single in 1978 and reached number 18 on the charts.\n\nFrey, Henley, and Schmit contributed backup vocals for the single release of \"[[Look What You've Done to Me]]\" by [[Boz Scaggs]]. A different version with female backing vocals appears on the ''[[Urban Cowboy]]'' soundtrack, along with the Eagles' 1975 hit \"Lyin' Eyes\".\n\nOn July 31, 1980, in [[Long Beach, California]], tempers boiled over into what has been described as the \"Long Night at Wrong Beach\".<ref name=\"Times\">{{cite news|title= How The Eagles took it to the limits |newspaper= [[The Times]] |location= London |date= October 12, 2007 |url= http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article2638985.ece |archive-date= July 18, 2008 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080718172259/http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article2638985.ece}}</ref>{{sfn|Felder|Holden|2008|p=209}} The animosity between Felder and Frey boiled over before the show began, when Felder said, \"You're welcome – I guess\" to California Senator [[Alan Cranston]]'s wife as the politician was thanking the band backstage for performing a benefit for his re-election.{{sfn|Felder|Holden|2008|pp=209–210}} Frey and Felder spent the entire show telling each other about the beating each planned to administer backstage. \"Only three more songs until I kick your ass, pal,\" Frey recalled Felder telling him near the end of the band's set.<ref>{{cite news|first= Andrew |last= Gumbel |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/eagles-reform-checking-back-into-the-hotel-california-434806.html |title= Eagles reform: checking back into the Hotel California |newspaper= [[The Independent]] |date= February 3, 2007 |access-date= November 27, 2010}}</ref> Felder recalls Frey telling him during \"Best of My Love\", \"I'm gonna kick your ass when we get off the stage.\"<ref name=\"Times\"/>{{sfn|Felder|Holden|2008|p=210}}\n\nIt appeared to be the end of the Eagles, but the band still had a commitment with [[Elektra Records]] to make a live record from the tour.

It was written by [[Steve Young (musician)|Steve Young]] in an arrangement created by [[Iain Matthews]] for his ''Valley Hi'' album in 1973. The song reached number 21 on the charts in 1980, becoming the Eagles' last Top 40 single until 1994.\n\n===1980–1994: hiatus===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2019}}\nAfter the Eagles broke up, the former members pursued solo careers. Elektra, the band's long-time record label, initially owned the rights to solo albums created by members of the Eagles. Walsh had established himself as a solo artist in the 1970s, but it was uncharted waters for the others.\n\nWalsh released a successful album in 1981, ''[[There Goes the Neighborhood (album)|There Goes the Neighborhood]],'' but subsequent albums throughout the 1980s were less well received. During this period, Walsh performed as a session musician for [[Dan Fogelberg]], [[Steve Winwood]], [[John Entwistle]], [[Richard Marx]] and [[Emerson, Lake & Palmer]], among others, and produced and co-wrote [[Ringo Starr]]'s ''[[Old Wave]]'' album.\n\nHenley achieved commercial solo success. In 1981, he sang a duet with [[Stevie Nicks]] ([[Fleetwood Mac]]), \"[[Leather and Lace (song)|Leather and Lace]]\". In 1982, he released ''[[I Can't Stand Still]],'' featuring the hit \"[[Dirty Laundry (Don Henley song)|Dirty Laundry]]\". The next album, ''[[Building the Perfect Beast]]'' (1984), featured \"[[The Boys of Summer (song)|The Boys of Summer]]\" (a ''Billboard'' number 5 hit), \"[[All She Wants to Do Is Dance]]\" (number 9), \"Not Enough Love in the World\" (number 34) and \"[[Sunset Grill (song)|Sunset Grill]]\" (number 22). Henley's next album, ''[[The End of the Innocence (album)|The End of the Innocence]]'' (1989), was also a major success. It included \"[[The End of the Innocence (song)|The End of the Innocence]]\", \"[[The Last Worthless Evening]]\" and \"[[The Heart of the Matter (song)|The Heart of the Matter]]\". His solo career was cut short due to a contract dispute with his record company, which was finally resolved when the Eagles reunited in 1994.\n\nFrey achieved solo success in the 1980s. In 1982, he released his first album, ''[[No Fun Aloud]]'', which spawned the number 15 hit \"[[The One You Love (Glenn Frey song)|The One You Love]]\". ''[[The Allnighter (album)|The Allnighter]]'' (1984) featured the number 20 hit \"Sexy Girl\". He reached number 2 on the charts with \"[[The Heat Is On (Glenn Frey song)|The Heat Is On]]\" from the ''[[Beverly Hills Cop]]'' soundtrack. He had another number 2 single in 1985 with \"[[You Belong to the City]]\" from the ''[[Miami Vice]]'' soundtrack, which featured another Frey song, \"[[Smuggler's Blues]]\". He appeared as \"Jimmy\" in the episode titled after the song and contributed riffs to the episode's soundtrack. He also contributed the songs \"Flip City\" to the ''[[Ghostbusters II]]'' soundtrack and \"Part of Me, Part of You\" to the soundtrack for ''[[Thelma & Louise]].''\n\nFormer music writer [[Cameron Crowe]] had written articles about Poco and the Eagles during his journalism career. In 1982, his first screenplay was produced as the feature-length movie ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]].'' The film was co-produced by Eagles manager Azoff, who also co-produced the soundtrack album, released by Elektra. Henley, Walsh, Schmit, and Felder all contributed solo songs to the film's soundtrack. The band playing at the dance toward the end of the movie covers the Eagles song \"[[Life in the Fast Lane]]\".\n\nFelder released a solo album, and contributed two songs to the soundtrack of the movie ''[[Heavy Metal (film)|Heavy Metal]]'': \"[[Heavy Metal (Takin' a Ride)]]\" (with Henley and Schmit providing backing vocals) and \"All of You\". He also had a minor hit, \"Bad Girls\", off his solo album ''[[Airborne (Don Felder album)|Airborne]].''\n\nSchmit had a prolific solo career after the band's initial breakup. He had a hit song on the ''Fast Times at Ridgemont High'' soundtrack with \"[[So Much in Love]]\". He contributed vocals to the [[Crosby, Stills, Nash, & Young|Crosby, Stills & Nash]] album ''[[Daylight Again]]'' on the songs \"Southern Cross\" and \"[[Wasted on the Way]]\" when that band needed an extra vocalist due to [[David Crosby]]'s drug overindulgence. Schmit sang backup vocals on [[Toto (band)|Toto]]'s ''[[Toto IV]]'' album, including the song \"[[I Won't Hold You Back]]\" and appeared with the group on their 1982 European tour. He spent three years (1983–1985) as a member of [[Jimmy Buffett]]'s Coral Reefer band. He had a Top 40 solo hit in 1987 with \"Boys' Night Out\" and a top-30 Adult Contemporary hit with \"Don't Give Up\", both from his album ''Timothy B.'' Schmit appeared with Meisner and Walsh on [[Richard Marx]]'s debut single \"[[Don't Mean Nothing]]\". In 1992, Schmit and Walsh toured as members of Ringo Starr's [[Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band|All-Starr Band]] and appeared on the live video from the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]]. Schmit released two solo albums, ''Playin' It Cool'' in 1984 and ''Tell Me the Truth'' in 1990. He was the only Eagle to appear on the 1993 Eagles tribute album ''[[Common Thread: The Songs of the Eagles]],'' singing backing vocals on [[Vince Gill]]'s cover of \"I Can't Tell You Why\".\n\nMeisner hit the top 40 three times, including the number 19 \"Hearts on Fire\" in 1981.\n\n===1994–2001: reunion, ''Hell Freezes Over''===\nAn Eagles country tribute album, titled ''[[Common Thread: The Songs of the Eagles]]'', was released in 1993, 13 years after the breakup. [[Travis Tritt]] insisted on having the ''Long Run''-era Eagles in his video for \"Take It Easy\" and they agreed. Following years of public speculation, the band formally reunited the following year. The lineup comprised the five ''Long Run''-era members—Frey, Henley, Walsh, Felder, and Schmit—supplemented by [[Scott F. Crago|Scott Crago]] (drums), John Corey (keyboards, guitar, backing vocals), [[Timothy Drury]] (keyboards, guitar, backing vocals), and former [[Loggins and Messina]] sideman Al Garth (sax, violin) on stage.\n\n\"For the record, we never broke up, we just took a 14-year vacation,\" said Frey at their first live performance in April 1994, one of two shows performed to record a live album and companion MTV special, both titled ''[[Hell Freezes Over]]'' (named for Henley's recurring statement that the group would get back together \"when hell freezes over\"); the album debuted at number 1 on the ''Billboard'' album chart. It included four new studio songs, with \"[[Get Over It (Eagles song)|Get Over It]]\" and \"[[Love Will Keep Us Alive]]\" both becoming Top 40 hits. The album proved successful, selling six million copies in the U.S.\n\nThe band subsequently embarked on a tour in 1994, which was interrupted in September because of Frey's serious recurrence of [[diverticulitis]], but it resumed in 1995 and continued into 1996.<ref>{{cite web|title= The Great Gastro-Intestinal Saga of Glenn Frey (1994–95) |url= http://eaglesonlinecentral.com/articles/illness.htm |url-status= dead |archive-date= October 11, 2007 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071011185039/http://eaglesonlinecentral.com/articles/illness.htm}}</ref> In 1998, the Eagles were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].
