This time he created a similar prototype instrument, a one-off solid-body electric guitar known as \"The Log\", which was manufactured utilizing a common construction material often referred as a “4×4 stud post”, which provided a unique neck-thru design.  The “stud post” (a 4″ × 4″ section of [[Douglas fir]]) was then equipped with a crude bridge and an electromagnetic [[Pickup (music technology)|pickup]], neck and strings.

This solved his two main problems: [[Audio feedback|feedback]], as the acoustic body no longer resonated with the amplified sound, and sustain, as the energy of the strings was not dissipated in generating sound through the guitar body. These instruments were constantly being improved and modified over the years, and Paul continued to use them in his recordings even after the development of his eponymous Gibson model.\n\nPaul approached the [[Gibson Guitar Corporation]] with his idea of a solid-body electric guitar in 1941,<ref name=\"Les Paul In His Own Words\"/> \nbut Gibson showed no interest until Fender began marketing its [[Fender Esquire|Esquire]] and [[Telecaster|Broadcaster]] guitars in 1950 (the Broadcaster was renamed the Telecaster in 1952).\n\nGibson's [[Ted McCarty]] was the chief designer of the guitar, which was based on Paul's drawings and later dubbed the [[Gibson Les Paul]]. Gibson entered into a promotional and financial arrangement with Les Paul, paying him a royalty on sales.<ref name=Lawrence2008>{{cite book|last=Lawrence|first=Robb|title=The Early Years of the Les Paul Legacy: 1915–1963|year=2008|publisher=Hal Leonard Corp|isbn=978-0634048616|page=304}}</ref> The guitar went on sale in 1952.

Not liking the new look and  severe problems with the strength of the body and neck, made Paul dissatisfied with this new Gibson guitar. This, and a pending divorce from [[Mary Ford]], led to Paul ending his endorsement and use of his name on Gibson guitars from 1964 until 1966, by which time his divorce was completed.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.jinxmagazine.com/les_paul.html |title= Interview &#124; July 19, 1999, at the Iridium jazz club, New York City |publisher= Jinx Magazine |date= July 19, 1999 |access-date= March 27, 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110713110152/http://www.jinxmagazine.com/les_paul.html |archive-date= July 13, 2011 |url-status= live }}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Headless guitar}}\nPaul continued to suggest technical improvements, although they were not always successful commercially.

In 1946,  his mother complimented him on a song she had heard on the radio, when in fact she had heard George Barnes, not Paul.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kane|first1=Brian|title=Acousmatic Fabrications: Les Paul and the 'Les Paulverizer' |journal=Journal of Visual Culture|date=August 2011|volume=10|issue=2|page=216|doi=10.1177/1470412911402892|s2cid=193109700}}</ref> This motivated Paul to spend two years in his Hollywood garage recording studio, creating his unique sound, his New Sound. Paul stunned the music industry with his New Sound in 1948.\n\nPaul recorded several songs with Bing Crosby, most notably \"[[It's Been a Long, Long Time]],\" which was a number-one single in 1945.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Waksman|first1=Steve|title=Les Paul: In Memoriam|journal=Popular Music & Society|date=May 2010|volume=33|issue=2|page=271|doi=10.1080/03007761003707944|s2cid=191470269}}</ref><ref name=\"SoundOnSound\"/>\n\nAfter a recording session, Bing Crosby suggested that Paul build a recording studio so he could produce the sound he wanted. Paul started his studio in the garage of his home on North Curson Street in Hollywood. The studio drew many vocalists and musicians who wanted the benefit of his expertise. His experiments included microphone placement, track speed, and recording overdubs. These methods resulted in a clarity previously unheard in this type of multitrack recording. People began to consider his recording techniques as instruments—as important to production as a guitar, bass, or drums.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Waksman|first1=Steve|title=Les Paul: In Memoriam|journal=Popular Music & Society|date=May 2010|volume=33|issue=2|page=3|doi=10.1080/03007761003707944|s2cid=191470269}}</ref>\n\nCapitol Records released \"[[Lover (When You're Near Me)]]\", on which Paul played eight different parts on electric guitar,<ref name=\"SoundOnSound\"/> some recorded at half-speed, hence \"double-fast\" when played back at normal speed for the [[master recording|master]]. This was the first time he used multitracking in a recording. His early multitrack recordings, including \"Lover\" and \"Brazil\", were made with [[acetate disc]]s. He recorded a track onto a disk, then recorded himself playing another part with the first. He built the multitrack recording with overlaid tracks rather than parallel ones as he did later. By the time he had a result that satisfied him, he had discarded some five hundred recording disks.\n\nAs a teen he had built a disc-cutter assembly using the flywheel from a [[Cadillac]], a dental belt and other parts from his father's car repair shop. Years later in his Hollywood garage, he used the acetate disc setup to record parts at different speeds and with delay, resulting in his signature sound with echoes and birdsong-like guitar riffs.\n\nIn 1949, Crosby gave Paul one of the first [[Ampex]] Model 200A [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording|reel to reel tape recorders]].<ref name=\"Les Paul In His Own Words\"/> Paul invented sound on sound recording using this machine by placing an additional playback head, located before the conventional erase/record/playback heads. This allowed Paul to play along with a previously recorded track, both of which were mixed together onto a new track. The Ampex was a monophonic tape recorder with only one track across the entire width of quarter-inch tape, and therefore, the recording was \"destructive\" in the sense that the original recording was permanently replaced with the new, mixed recording. He eventually enhanced this by using one tape machine to play back the original recording and a second to record the combined track. This preserved the original recording.<ref name=\"aes.org\">{{cite web |url=http://www.aes.org/aeshc/docs/sel-sync/snyder_sel-sync.pdf |title=Sel-sync and the \"Octopus\": How Came to be the First Recorder to Minimize Successive Copying in Overdubs |work=ARSC Journal |access-date=March 27, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519105331/http://www.aes.org/aeshc/docs/sel-sync/snyder_sel-sync.pdf |archive-date=May 19, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn 1952, Paul invented the [[flanging|flange effect]], where a sound phases in and out in harmonic tone.

They began working together on Paul's radio show, as Rhubarb Red and The Ozark Apple Knockers with Mary Lou. Later Paul suggested the stage name [[Mary Ford]]. They married in Milwaukee in 1949.\n\nTheir hits included \"[[How High the Moon]]\", \"[[Bye Bye Blues (song)|Bye Bye Blues]]\", \"Song in Blue\", \"Don'cha Hear Them Bells\", \"[[The World Is Waiting for the Sunrise]]\", and \"[[Vaya con Dios (song)|Vaya con Dios]]\". The songs were recorded with multiple tracks where Ford harmonized with herself and Paul played multiple layers of guitars.\n\nThey used the recording technique known as [[close miking]]<ref name=Garage/> where the microphone is less than {{convert|6|in|cm|0}} from the singer's mouth. This produces a more intimate, less reverberant sound than when a singer is {{convert|1|ft|cm|-1}} or more from the microphone. When using a pressure-gradient (uni- or bi-directional) microphone, it emphasizes low-frequency sounds in the voice due to the microphone's [[Proximity effect (audio)|proximity effect]] and gives a more relaxed feel because the performer is not working as hard. The result is a singing style which diverged from the unamplified theater style of the musical comedies of the 1930s and 1940s.\n\nThey also performed music-hall style semi-comic routines with Mary mimicking whatever line Les decided to improvise.<ref>{{Citation|title=Les Paul & Mary Ford Absolutely Live|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awjTKeS9Wvo| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211107/awjTKeS9Wvo| archive-date=2021-11-07 | url-status=live|date=June 27, 2014|language=en|access-date=2021-08-11}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\n===Radio and television programs===\nPaul hosted a 15-minute radio program, ''The Les Paul Show'', on [[NBC Radio]] in 1950, featuring his trio (himself, Ford and rhythm player Eddie Stapleton) and his electronics. The program was recorded from their home and with gentle humor between Paul and Ford bridging musical selections, some of which had already been successful on records, some of which anticipated the couple's recordings, and many of which presented re-interpretations of such jazz and pop selections as \"[[In the Mood]]\", \"Little Rock Getaway\", \"Brazil\", and \"[[Tiger Rag]]\".

The five-minute show, consisting of the performance of only one or two songs, aired five times a day, five days a week, and therefore was used as a brief interlude or fill-in for programming schedules.

The device even became the subject of comedy, with Ford multiplying herself and her [[vacuum cleaner]] with it so she could finish the housework faster. Later, Paul created a real Les Paulverizer that he attached to his guitar.

The album featured songs based on Edgar Allan Poe's writing by the northeastern Pennsylvania band the Glass Prism. The album produced a single titled \"The Raven\" that appeared on Billboard's Hot 100.\n\nAs years progressed Paul played at slower tempos with a large pick that was easier to hold in his arthritic hand. In 2006, at the age of  90, he won two Grammy Awards at the [[48th Annual Grammy Awards]] for his album ''Les Paul & Friends: American Made World Played''. He also performed every Monday night at Manhattan's [[Iridium Jazz Club]] with guitarist Lou Pallo, bassist Paul Nowinski (and later, [[Nicki Parrott]]), and guitarist [[Frank Vignola]] and for a few years, pianist [[John Colianni]].
