Born in [[Atlanta, Texas]], and raised in [[Foreman, Arkansas]], Lawrence began performing at age 15 and moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], in 1990 to begin his country music career. He signed to [[Atlantic Records]] Nashville in 1991 and made his debut late that year with the album ''[[Sticks and Stones (Tracy Lawrence album)|Sticks and Stones]]''. Five more studio albums, as well as a live album and a compilation album, followed throughout the 1990s and into 2000 on Atlantic before the label's country division was closed in 2001. Afterward, he recorded for [[Warner Bros. Records]], [[DreamWorks Records]], [[Mercury Records Nashville]], and his own labels, Rocky Comfort Records and Lawrence Music Group.\n\nLawrence has released a total of 14 studio albums. His most commercially successful albums are ''[[Alibis (album)|Alibis]]'' (1993) and ''[[Time Marches On]]'' (1996), both certified double-platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). He has charted more than forty singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts, including eight songs that reached the number one position: \"[[Sticks and Stones (Tracy Lawrence song)|Sticks and Stones]]\", \"[[Alibis (song)|Alibis]]\", \"[[Can't Break It to My Heart]]\", \"[[My Second Home]]\", \"[[If the Good Die Young]]\", \"[[Texas Tornado (song)|Texas Tornado]]\", \"[[Time Marches On (song)|Time Marches On]]\", and \"[[Find Out Who Your Friends Are]]\". Of these, \"Time Marches On\" is his longest-lasting at three weeks, while \"Find Out Who Your Friends Are\" set a record at the time for the slowest ascent to the top of that chart. His musical style is defined mainly by [[neotraditional country]] and [[honky-tonk]] influences, although he has also recorded [[country pop]], Christmas music, and [[Christian country music]]. He has won Top New Male Vocalist from ''Billboard'' in 1992 and from [[Academy of Country Music]] in 1993, and Vocal Event of the Year from the [[Country Music Association]] in 2007.\n\n==Biography==\nTracy Lee Lawrence was born in [[Atlanta, Texas]], on January 27, 1968.<ref name=\"arkansas\"/><ref name=\"whitburn\">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2012|publisher=Record Research, Inc|date=2012|pages=188–189|isbn=978-0-89820-203-8}}</ref> He was raised by his stay-at-home mother JoAnn Dickens and stepfather Duane Dickens.
