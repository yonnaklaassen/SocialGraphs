He also served on the board of the [[Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum|Country Music Hall of Fame]].\n\n==Life and career==\nKing was born in [[Abrams (CDP), Wisconsin|Abrams, Wisconsin]] to a Polish American family, and lived in Abrams during his youth. He learned to play the accordion from his father, who was a professional [[polka]] musician. In the 1930s, he toured and made cowboy movies with [[Gene Autry]].<ref name=miller>Miller, James.

The half-hour program was broadcast at 7:15&nbsp;p.m. on Mondays.<ref name=v>{{cite magazine |date=February 16, 1949 |page=36 |title=Pee Wee King Show |magazine=Variety |url=https://archive.org/details/variety173-1949-02/page/n155/mode/1up?view=theater |accessdate=January 29, 2023 }}</ref>\n\nKing wrote or co-wrote more than four hundred songs and recorded more than twenty albums and 157 singles. His other songs included \"[[Slow Poke]]\" and \"[[You Belong to Me (1952 song)|You Belong to Me]]\", both co-authored with [[Chilton Price]] and [[Redd Stewart]].<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> His songs introduced [[waltz]]es, polkas, and [[Cowboy music|cowboy songs]] to country music.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> King became one of the charter members of the [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 1970.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/>\n\nKing was not permitted to use the drummer and trumpeter he featured in his stage shows when the band played at the [[Grand Ole Opry]], where both instruments were banned. He ignored that ban only once, appearing at the Ryman in April 1945 following the death of [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]. The Opry had been canceled, but since a number of fans showed up, management decided to have King perform his stage show for them, performing as he did outside the Opry. He used his full band, with drums and trumpet. When confronted about it afterward, King told Opry emcee [[George D. Hay]] that he had done his stage show, as asked. Bob Wills had defied the Opry ban on drums a year earlier during a 1944 guest appearance.<ref>Kienzle, Richard. (2003). Southwest shuffle: pioneers of honky-tonk, Western swing, and country jazz.
