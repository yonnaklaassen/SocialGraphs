The Uniques were based out of [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]], about 55 miles southwest of Springhill, and began performing in [[Arkansas]], Louisiana, and [[Texas]]. In 1965, The Uniques recorded \"Not Too Long Ago\" (another Kilgore/Stampley composition),<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> the first national hit for Paula Records. One year later, they followed with \"[[All These Things (Joe Stampley song)|All These Things]]\".<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> The Uniques released four original albums, and one [[greatest hits]] [[compilation album|compilation]] between 1965 and their 1970 breakup.
