In his teens, he decided upon a career as a [[rodeo]] rider. Recovering from injuries sustained from a fall during the mid-1950s, he started learning guitar. In the late 1950s, he relocated to Toronto, aspiring to a career as a commercial artist. He also started playing clubs and coffeehouses in Toronto.<ref name=\"ch\">{{cite web|url=http://tceplus.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=U1ARTU0000752|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051205043718/http://tceplus.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=U1ARTU0000752|url-status=dead|title=Coffeehouses|archive-date=December 5, 2005}}</ref> By 1959 he was performing music as a full-time occupation.\n\n[[Sylvia Tyson]], née Fricker, CM, was born in Chatham, Ontario in 1940. While still in her teens, she started frequenting the folk clubs of Toronto.\n\n===Career===\n====Folk duo====\nThe two started performing together in Toronto in 1959. By 1962, they were living in New York City, where they caught the attention of manager [[Albert Grossman]],<ref>{{cite web|author=Gilliland, John. |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc1692106/m1/#track/9 |title=Pop Chronicles Interviews #184 - Ian and Sylvia Tyson - All Tracks UNT Digital Library |publisher=Digital.library.unt.edu |date=1968-01-12 |accessdate=2021-03-02}}</ref> who managed [[Peter, Paul and Mary]] and would soon become [[Bob Dylan]]'s manager. Grossman secured them a contract with [[Vanguard Records]] and they released their first album late in the year.<ref name=\"canadianmusichalloffame.ca\"/>\n\nTheir first album, self-titled ''Ian & Sylvia'', on Vanguard Records consists mainly of traditional songs.<ref>{{cite magazine|date=August 25, 1962|magazine=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|page=24|title=Ian & Sylvia|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> There were British and Canadian folk songs, spiritual music, and a few [[blues]] songs thrown into the mix. The album was moderately successful and they made the list of performers for the 1963 [[Newport Folk Festival]].\n\n''Four Strong Winds'', their second album, was similar to the first, with the exception of the inclusion of the early Dylan composition \"[[Tomorrow Is a Long Time]]\" and the title song \"[[Four Strong Winds]]\", written by Ian Tyson. \"Four Strong Winds\" was a major hit in Canada and ensured their stardom.<ref>[http://www.webfitz.com/lyrics/Charts/1963/Ch196310.html 30 Years of Canadian Chart Listings] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20021102214504/http://www.webfitz.com/lyrics/Charts/1963/Ch196310.html |date=2002-11-02 }} - #9 on 28 October 1963</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Ian & Sylvia|date=October 19, 1963|journal=Billboard Magazine|page=18|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> Years later, the song was named as the greatest Canadian song of all time by the CBC-Radio program ''50 Tracks: The Canadian Version''.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe two married in June 1964; they also released their third album, ''Northern Journey'', that year. It included a song written by Sylvia, titled \"[[You Were on My Mind]]\", recorded by both the California group [[We Five]] (a 1965 #4 on the [[RPM (magazine)|RPM]] charts, #1 on the Cashbox chart, #3 on the Billboard Hot 100) and British [[folk rock]] singer [[Crispian St. Peters]] (#29 on the [[RPM (magazine)|RPM]] charts, #36 in 1967).<ref>Joel Whitburn, ''Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits''</ref> A recording of \"Four Strong Winds\" by [[Bobby Bare]] made it to #3 on the [[country music|country]] charts around that time.\n\nOn the ''Northern Journey'' album was the song \"[[Someday Soon (Ian Tyson song)|Someday Soon]]\", a composition by Ian Tyson that would rival \"Four Strong Winds\" in its popularity. (Both songs would eventually be recorded by dozens of singers.)\n\nTheir fourth album, ''Early Morning Rain'', consisted in large part of new songs. They introduced the work of the couple's fellow Canadian songwriter and performer [[Gordon Lightfoot]] through the title song and \"(That's What You Get) For Lovin' Me\". They also included the first recording of the song \"[[Darcy Farrow]]\" by [[Steve Gillette]] and Tom Campbell, as well as a number of their own compositions.\n \nThey performed at the [[1965 Newport Folk Festival]].<ref name=pc32>{{Pop Chronicles |32| 1}}</ref> ''Play One More'', their offering of 1965, showed a move toward the electrified folk-like music that was becoming popular with groups like [[the Byrds]] and [[the Lovin' Spoonful]]. The title tune used horns to evoke the [[mariachi]] style.\n\nIn 1967, they released two albums, one recorded for Vanguard, the other for [[MGM]]. These two efforts, ''So Much For Dreaming'' and ''Lovin' Sound'', were far less dynamic presentations.\n\nFrom 1970 to 1975, Ian Tyson hosted ''The Ian Tyson Show'' on [[CTV Television Network|CTV]], known as ''Nashville North'' in its first season. Sylvia Tyson and the Great Speckled Bird appeared often on the series.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.tvarchive.ca/database/17889/ian_tyson_show,_the/details/ | title=Ian Tyson Show, The (Series) (1970-1975) |date=February 2003 | access-date=July 18, 2019 | publisher=TV Archive}}</ref>\n\n====Country rock pioneers====\nThey moved to Nashville, Tennessee, where they recorded two albums; one to fulfill the terms of their Vanguard contract, the other to supply MGM with a second (and last) album for that label. The albums can be defined as early [[country rock]] music; ''Nashville'' for Vanguard was cut in February 1968, one month before the Byrds' ''[[Sweetheart of the Rodeo]]'', widely considered the first collaboration of rock and Nashville players.<ref name=\"Rolling Stone-Nashville\"/> Three of Bob Dylan's ''[[Basement Tapes]]'' songs are included on their Nashville albums; most of the rest were written by Ian or Sylvia.<ref name=\"Rolling Stone-Nashville\">{{cite magazine | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/inside-ian-sylvias-nashville-country-rocks-great-lost-album-20150722 | title=Inside Ian & Sylvia's 'Nashville,' Country-Rock's Great Lost Album | magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] | date=July 22, 2015 | access-date=October 11, 2016 | author=Browne, David | author-link=David Browne (journalist)}}</ref>\n\nIn 1969, Ian & Sylvia formed the [[country rock]] group [[Great Speckled Bird (band)|Great Speckled Bird]]. In addition to participating in the cross-Canada rock-and-roll rail tour [[Festival Express]], they recorded [[Great Speckled Bird (album)|a self-titled album]] for the short-lived [[Ampex]] label. Produced by [[Todd Rundgren]], the record failed when Ampex was unable to establish widespread distribution. Thousands of copies never left the warehouse, and it has become a much sought-after collector's item. Initially, the album artist was given as Great Speckled Bird but later copies had a sticker saying that it featured the duo.\n\nIan & Sylvia's last two albums were recorded on [[Columbia Records]]. The first, 1971's ''Ian and Sylvia'' (not to be confused with their 1962 self-titled release) consists largely of mainstream country-flavored songs. This album was released on CD, with extra tracks, as ''The Beginning of the End'' in 1996.<ref>{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r245993|pure_url=yes}}|title=''The Beginning of the End''|website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=2012-04-04}}</ref> Their second Columbia record, 1972's ''You Were on My Mind'', featured a later incarnation of Great Speckled Bird. The songs range from hard country rock to middle-of-the-road country material. Neither of the Columbia albums sold well. They were eventually combined and released as 1974's ''The Best of Ian and Sylvia''.\n\nIn 1972, Ian & Sylvia performed the song \"Let Her Alone\" for [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney Productions]]' live-action drama ''[[Run, Cougar, Run]]''. Ian also served as the film's narrator.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://every70smovie.blogspot.com/2016/08/run-cougar-run-1972.html|title=Every 70s Movie: Run, Cougar, Run (1972)|first=Peter|last=Hanson|website=Every70smovie.blogspot.com|date=August 18, 2016}}</ref>\n\nBy 1975, Ian & Sylvia had stopped performing together and soon afterwards were divorced. Their final appearance as a duo was in May 1975 at the [[Horseshoe Tavern]] in Toronto.<ref name=ce/>\n\n===Post-divorce===\nAfter their marriage ended in 1975, Ian returned to Southern Alberta to farm and train horses, but continued his musical career.
