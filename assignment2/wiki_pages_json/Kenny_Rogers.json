After some solo releases, including 1958's \"[[That Crazy Feeling]]\", Rogers then joined a group with the  jazz singer [[Bobby Doyle (jazz vocalist)|Bobby Doyle]]. In 1966, he became a member of the folk ensemble [[the New Christy Minstrels]], playing double bass and bass guitar as well as singing.<ref name=\"DeYoung\" /> In 1967, he and several members of the New Christy Minstrels left to found the group [[Kenny Rogers and The First Edition|the First Edition]], with whom he scored his first major hit, \"[[Just Dropped In (To See What Condition My Condition Was In)]]\", a [[psychedelic rock]] song which peaked at number five on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts. As Rogers took an increased leadership role in the First Edition following the success of 1969's \"[[Ruby, Don't Take Your Love to Town]]\", the band gradually changed styles to a more country feel. The band broke up in 1975–76, and Rogers embarked on a long and successful solo career, which included several successful collaborations, including duets with singers [[Dottie West]], [[Dolly Parton]], and [[Sheena Easton]], and a songwriting partnership with [[Lionel Richie]]. His signature song, 1978's \"[[The Gambler (song)|The Gambler]]\", was a crossover hit that won him a [[Grammy Award]] in 1980 and was selected in 2018 for preservation in the [[National Recording Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]].

We lived in a federal housing project. I think the most money my father ever made was $75 a week. There were times as a child that, I don't think I was ever really hungry – I always had food to eat – but there's no question that our family were nutritionally-deprived at times.

The group recorded for [[Columbia Records]]. They disbanded in 1965, and a 1966 jazzy rock single Rogers recorded for [[Mercury Records]], called \"[[Here's That Rainy Day]]\", failed. Rogers also worked as a producer, writer and session musician for other performers, including country artists [[Mickey Gilley]] and [[Eddy Arnold]]. In 1966, he joined [[the New Christy Minstrels]] as a singer and double bass player.<ref name=\"DeYoung\" />\n\nFeeling that the Minstrels were not offering the success they wanted, Rogers and fellow members Mike Settle, Terry Williams, and Thelma Camacho left the group.<ref name=\"DeYoung\" /> They formed [[Kenny Rogers and The First Edition|the First Edition]] in 1967 (later renamed \"Kenny Rogers and the First Edition\"). They were later joined by Kin Vassy. They chalked up a string of hits on both the pop and country charts, including \"[[Just Dropped In (To See What Condition My Condition Was In)]]\" (Rogers doing lead vocals and bass—and famously used in the dream sequence of the [[Coen brothers]]' ''[[The Big Lebowski]]''),<ref name=\"DeYoung\" /> \"[[But You Know I Love You]]\", \"[[Ruby, Don't Take Your Love to Town]]\", \"Tell It All, Brother\", \"Reuben James\", and \"[[Something's Burning (song)|Something's Burning]]\".<ref name=\"DeYoung\" /><ref name=journal />\n\nWhen the First Edition disbanded in 1976, Rogers launched his solo career.<ref name=\"DeYoung\" /><ref>{{Cite news |last1=Gordon |first1=Dave |title=Kenny Rogers prepares to hang up his microphone |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-39784924 |access-date=March 21, 2020 |work=BBC News |date=May 8, 2017}}</ref> He soon developed a more middle-of-the-road sound that sold to both pop and country audiences. He charted more than 60 top 40 hit singles (including two number ones—\"Lady\" and \"Islands in the Stream\").

Together the duo won two gold records (one of which later went platinum), two CMA Awards, an ACM nomination, two Grammy nominations and 1 Music City News Award for their two hit albums ''Every Time Two Fools Collide'' (No.&nbsp;1) and ''Classics'' (No.&nbsp;3), selling out stadiums and arenas while on tour for several years, as well as appearing on several network television specials which showcased them. Their hits together \"[[Every Time Two Fools Collide (song)|Every Time Two Fools Collide]]\" (No.&nbsp;1), \"Anyone Who Isn't Me Tonight\" (No.&nbsp;2), \"[[What Are We Doin' in Love]]\" (No.&nbsp;1), \"All I Ever Need Is You\" (No.&nbsp;1) and \"Till I Can Make It On My Own\" (No.&nbsp;3) all became Country standards. Of West, Rogers stated in a 1995 TNN interview: \"She, more than anybody else I ever worked with, sang with such emotion that you actually believed what she sang. A lot of people sing words, Dottie West sang emotions.\" In a 1978 press release for their album \"Every Time Two Fools Collide\", Rogers credited West with further establishing and cementing his career with Country Music audiences. In the same release, West credited him with taking her career to new audiences. Rogers was with West only hours before she died at age 58 after sustaining injuries in a 1991 car accident, as discussed in his 2012 biography \"Luck Or Something Like It\". In 1995 he starred as himself, alongside [[Michele Lee]] as West, in the [[CBS]] biographical film ''[[Big Dreams and Broken Hearts: The Dottie West Story]]''.\n\nIn 1980, a selection he recorded as a duet with [[Kim Carnes]], \"[[Don't Fall in Love with a Dreamer]]\", became a hit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jacksonville.com/entertainment/2017-01-26/kenny-rogers-final-tour-retiring-includes-concert-thrasher-horne-saturday |title=Kenny Rogers's final tour before retiring includes concert at Thrasher-Horne on Saturday |author=Crumpler, David |date=January 26, 2017 |access-date=April 7, 2017 |work=[[The Florida Times-Union]]}}</ref> Earlier that year, he sang a duet of \"You and Me\" with [[Lynda Carter]] in her television music special ''Lynda Carter Special'' (Rogers originally recorded this with Dottie West for the [[Every Time Two Fools Collide]] album).  Later in 1980 came his partnership with [[Lionel Richie]], who wrote and produced Rogers's No.&nbsp;1 hit \"[[Lady (Kenny Rogers song)|Lady]]\".<ref name=cmt1304 /> Richie went on to produce Rogers's 1981 album ''Share Your Love,'' a chart topper and commercial favorite featuring hits such as \"[[I Don't Need You]]\" (Pop No.&nbsp;3), \"[[Through the Years (Kenny Rogers song)|Through the Years]]\" (Pop No.&nbsp;13), and \"[[Share Your Love with Me]]\" (Pop No.&nbsp;14). His first Christmas album was also released that same year. Rogers would return the favor by singing backing vocals on Richie's top 5 hit \"[[My Love (Lionel Richie song)|My Love]]\". In 1982, Rogers released the album ''[[Love Will Turn You Around]].'' The album's [[Love Will Turn You Around (song)|the title track]] reached No.&nbsp;13 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and topped the country and AC charts. It was the theme song of Rogers's 1982 film ''[[Six Pack (film)|Six Pack]]''. Shortly afterwards, he started working with producer [[David Foster]] in 1983, recording the smash Top 10 hit [[Bob Seger]] cover \"[[We've Got Tonight]]\", a duet with [[Sheena Easton]]. Also a number 1 single on the Country charts in the United States, it reached the Top 30 on the British charts.<ref name=\"DeYoung\" />\n\nIn 1981, Rogers bought the old ABC Dunhill building and built one of the most popular and state-of-the-art recording studios in Los Angeles, which he named [[Lion Share Studios]]. The song \"[[We Are the World]]\" was recorded there and at [[A&M Studios]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FyUEAAAAMBAJ&q=kenny+rogers+lion+share+recording+studio&pg=PA52|title=Rogers Buys Studio|last=McCullaugh|page=52|first=Jim|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=February 6, 1982|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nRogers went on to work with [[Barry Gibb]] of the [[Bee Gees]] who produced his 1983 hit album ''[[Eyes That See in the Dark]]'', featuring the title track and yet another No.&nbsp;1 hit \"[[Islands in the Stream (song)|Islands in the Stream]]\", a duet with [[Dolly Parton]]. Gibb, along with his brothers, Robin and Maurice, originally wrote the song for [[Diana Ross]] in an R&B style, only later to change it for Rogers's album.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Newman |first=Melinda |title=Barry Gibb on Reuniting with Dolly Parton & Who He 'Freaked Out' Over While Recording New Country Duets Album |url=https://www.billboard.com/music/country/barry-gibb-interview-duets-album-dolly-parton-9507251/ |magazine=Billboard |date=5 January 2021}}</ref>\n\n\"Islands in the Stream\", Rogers's duet with Dolly Parton, was the first single to be released from ''Eyes That See in the Dark'' in the United States, and it quickly went to No.&nbsp;1 in the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] (it would prove to be the last country single to reach No.&nbsp;1 on that chart until \"[[Amazed]]\" by [[Lonestar]] did so in 2000), as well as topping ''Billboard''{{'}}s country and adult contemporary singles charts;  it was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for shipping two million copies in the United States. Rogers would reunite with Parton in 1984 for a holiday album, [[Once Upon a Christmas (Kenny Rogers & Dolly Parton album)|''Once Upon a Christmas'']], and the TV special ''Kenny & Dolly: A Christmas to Remember'' (which resulted in a popular video of \"Christmas Without You\"), as well as a 1985 duet \"[[Real Love (Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers song)|Real Love]]\", which also topped the U.S. country singles chart. The two would continue to collaborate on occasional projects through subsequent years, including a 2013 duet single \"[[You Can't Make Old Friends]]\".<ref name=\"DeYoung\" />\n\nDespite the success of \"Islands in the Stream\", however, [[RCA Records]] insisted on releasing ''Eyes''{{'}} title track as the first UK single, and the song stalled at a disappointing No.&nbsp;61 there, although it did stay in the top 100 for several weeks. (When it was eventually released in the United States, it was more successful, charting high on the Adult Contemporary chart and making the country top 30.) \"Islands in the Stream\" was issued as a follow-up single in Britain and sold well, making No.&nbsp;7. The album itself reached No.&nbsp;1 on the country charts on both sides of the Atlantic and enjoyed multi-million sales. \"Buried Treasure\", \"This Woman\" and \"Evening Star\"/\"Midsummer Nights\" were also all successful singles from the album.\n\nShortly after came the album ''[[What About Me? (Kenny Rogers album)|What About Me?]]'', a hit whose [[What About Me? (Kenny Rogers song)|title track]]—a trio performance with [[James Ingram]] and [[Kim Carnes]]—was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]]; the single \"[[Crazy (Kenny Rogers song)|Crazy]]\" (not to be confused with the [[Willie Nelson]]-penned [[Patsy Cline]] hit), co-written with [[Richard Marx]], topped the country charts. David Foster was to work again with Rogers in his 1985 album ''The Heart of the Matter,'' although this time Foster was playing backing music rather than producing, a role given to [[George Martin]]. This album was another success, going to No.&nbsp;1, with the title track making to the top ten category in the singles charts.\n\nThe next few years saw Rogers scoring several top country hits on a regular basis, including \"Twenty Years Ago\", \"Morning Desire\", \"Tomb of the Unknown Love\", among others.  On January 28, 1985, Rogers was one of the 45 artists who recorded the worldwide charity song \"[[We Are the World]]\" to support hunger victims in Africa. The following year he played at Giants Stadium.<ref name=\"Front Row King\">{{cite web|title=Kenny Rogers Concert Tickets |website=Frontrowking.com|url=http://www.frontrowking.com/buy-kenny-rogers-concert-tickets/index.html|access-date=February 13, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 1988, Rogers won a Grammy Award for \"Best Country Collaboration with Vocals\" with [[Ronnie Milsap]]—\"Make No Mistake, She's Mine\". In the 1990s, Rogers continued to chart with singles such as \"The Factory\" and \"Crazy In Love\", another selection that Kim Carnes provided him with, \"If You Want To Find Love\", and \"The Greatest\". His second Christmas album, titled ''Christmas in America,'' was released in 1989 for Reprise Records. From 1991 to 1994, Rogers hosted ''[[The Real West]]'' on [[A&E Network|A&E]], and on [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]] since 1995 (Reruns only on The History Channel). He visited Miller's during this time period. From 1992 to 1995, Rogers co-owned and headlined [[Branson, Missouri]]'s 4,000 seat Grand Palace Theatre. In 1994, Rogers released his \"dream\" album titled ''Timepiece'' on Atlantic Records. It consisted of 1930s/1940s jazz standards, the type of music he had performed in his early days with the Bobby Doyle Three in [[Houston]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theoaklandpress.com/arts-and-entertainment/20161201/kenny-rogers-plans-to-fold-em-after-final-concert-tour |title=Kenny Rogers plans to fold 'em after final concert tour |author=Graff, Gary |date=December 1, 2016 |access-date=April 7, 2017 |work=[[Oakland Press]]}}</ref>\n\nIn 1996, Rogers released an album ''Vote For Love'' where the public requested their favorite love songs and Rogers performed the songs. (Several of his own hits were in the final version.) The album was the first for the TV shopping channel QVC's record label, onQ Music. The album, sold exclusively by [[QVC]], was a huge success and was later issued in stores under a variety of different titles. It reached No.&nbsp;1 in the UK country charts under the title ''Love Songs'' (a title also used for various compilations) and also crossed over into the mainstream charts.\n\nIn 1999, Rogers scored with the single \"The Greatest\", a song about life from a child's point of view (looked at through a baseball game)<ref name=RugbyIndependent2007 /> The song reached the top 40 of ''Billboard's'' Country singles chart and was a [[Country Music Television]] Number One video. It was on Rogers's album ''She Rides Wild Horses'' the following year (itself a top 10 success).<ref name=\"DeYoung\" /> Also in 1999, Rogers produced a song, \"We've Got It All\", specifically for the series finale of the ABC show ''[[Home Improvement (TV series)|Home Improvement]].''\n\n===2000–2015===\n[[File:WIKI KENNY ROGERS.jpg|thumb|right|Rogers in 2004]]\nIn the 21st century (and at age 61), Rogers was back at No.&nbsp;1 for the first time in more than a decade with the 2000 single \"[[Buy Me a Rose]]\".<ref name=cmt1304 /> In doing so, he broke a 26-year-old record held by [[Hank Snow]] (who, in April 1974, was aged 59 when he scored with \"[[Hello Love (song)|Hello Love]]\"). Rogers held the record until 2003, when then 70-year-old [[Willie Nelson]] became the oldest artist to have a No.&nbsp;1 on the country charts with his duet with [[Toby Keith]], \"[[Beer for My Horses]]\".\n\nAlthough Rogers did not record new albums for a couple of years, he continued to have success in many countries with more greatest hits packages.  In 2004 ''[[42 Ultimate Hits]]'', which was the first hits collection to span his days with the First Edition to the present, reached Number 6 on the American country charts and went gold.  It also featured two new songs, \"My World Is Over\" with [[Whitney Duncan]] and \"We Are the Same\".  \"My World Is Over\" was released as a single and was a minor hit. In 2005, ''The Very Best of Kenny Rogers'', a double album, sold well in Europe. It was the first new solo Rogers hits album to reach the United Kingdom for over a decade, despite many compilations there that were not true hits packages.\n\nRogers also signed with [[Capitol Records]] and had more success with the TV advertised release ''21 Number Ones'' in January 2006. Although this CD did contain 21 chart-toppers as the title claims (recorded between 1976 and the present day), this was not a complete collection of Rogers's No.&nbsp;1 singles, omitting such singles as \"Crazy in Love\" and \"What About Me?\"\n\nCapitol followed ''21 Number Ones'' with Rogers's new studio album, ''[[Water & Bridges]]'', in March 2006 on the [[Capitol Records|Capitol Nashville Records]] label. The first single from the album was \"[[I Can't Unlove You]]\", which peaked at No.&nbsp;17 on the country charts, after spending over 6 months on the hit list, more than 50 years after he formed his first group and 38 years after his first major hit as leader of the First Edition; the song remains in recurrent airplay on some radio stations today. \"I Can't Unlove You\" was followed up with the second single from the album, \"The Last Ten Years (Superman)\", in September 2006. The third single, \"Calling Me\", which features [[Don Henley]], became popular in early 2007, and was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] at the [[49th Annual Grammy Awards|2007 Grammy Awards]]. Also in 2007, the 1977 ''Kenny Rogers'' album was re-issued as a double CD, also featuring the 1979 ''Kenny'' album and this once again put Rogers's name into the sales charts worldwide. The following year, another compilation album (''A Love Song Collection'') also charted.<ref name=\"DeYoung\" />\n\nOn August 26, 2008, Rogers released ''50 Years''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.aol.ca/article/kenny-rogers-celebrates-new-project-of-old-classics/336423|title=Kenny Rogers Q&A—Celebrates New Project with Old Classics|publisher=AOL Music Canada|date=March 24, 2009|access-date=July 21, 2011}}</ref> exclusively at Cracker Barrel stores.
