Mandrell is from a musical family; she played several instruments by the time she was a teenager.

Her family formed a band in her late teens which traveled overseas and entertained military bases.

However, she returned to recording in 1985 and had several more top ten country singles including \"[[Fast Lanes and Country Roads]]\" (1985), \"[[No One Mends a Broken Heart Like You]]\" (1986), and \"[[I Wish I Could Fall in Love Today]]\" (1988).
