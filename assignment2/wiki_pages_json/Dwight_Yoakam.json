He first achieved mainstream attention in 1986 with the release of his debut album ''[[Guitars, Cadillacs, Etc., Etc.]]''. Yoakam had considerable success throughout the late 1980s onward, with a total of ten studio albums for [[Reprise Records]]. Later projects have been released on Audium (now [[MNRK Music Group]]), [[New West Records|New West]], [[Warner Records|Warner]], and [[Sugar Hill Records (bluegrass label)|Sugar Hill Records]].\n\nHis first three albums{{mdash}}''Guitars, Cadillacs, Etc., Etc.'', ''[[Hillbilly Deluxe (Dwight Yoakam album)|Hillbilly Deluxe]]'', and ''[[Buenas Noches from a Lonely Room]]''{{mdash}}all reached number one on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Top Country Albums]] chart. Yoakam also has two number-one singles on [[Hot Country Songs]] with \"[[Streets of Bakersfield]]\" (a duet with [[Buck Owens]]) and \"[[I Sang Dixie]]\", and twelve additional top-ten hits. He has won two [[Grammy Award]]s and one [[Academy of Country Music]] award. 1993's ''[[This Time (Dwight Yoakam album)|This Time]]'' is his most commercially successful album, having been [[music recording sales certification|certified]] triple-platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA).\n\nYoakam's musical style draws from a wide variety of influences including [[alternative country]], [[neotraditional country]], [[honky-tonk]], [[Rock music|rock]], and the [[Bakersfield sound]]. He is known for his distinctive tenor singing voice, unconventional musical image, and the lead guitar work of his longtime producer and bandleader [[Pete Anderson]]. Yoakam writes most of his own songs but has recorded many successful [[cover song]]s by a wide range of artists including [[Johnny Horton]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Cheap Trick]], [[The Blasters]], [[Lefty Frizzell]], and [[Queen (band)|Queen]]. He has collaborated with [[Beck]], [[John Mellencamp]], [[k.d. lang]], [[Ralph Stanley]], and members of [[Alison Krauss & Union Station]].\n\nAs an actor, Yoakam has appeared in the movies ''[[Red Rock West]]'', ''[[Sling Blade]]'', ''[[Panic Room]]'', ''[[The Minus Man]]'', and ''[[Wedding Crashers]]'', as well as ''[[South of Heaven, West of Hell]]'', which he wrote and directed. He also appeared in the TV series ''[[P.S. I Luv U]]'' and ''[[Under the Dome (TV series)|Under the Dome]]'', as well as the [[Amazon Prime Video]] original series ''[[Goliath (TV series)|Goliath]]''.\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Main at Grace in Pikeville.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Dwight Yoakam was born in [[Pikeville, Kentucky]].|alt=A view of buildings along a street in Pikeville, Kentucky.]]\nDwight David Yoakam was born October 23, 1956, in [[Pikeville, Kentucky]].<ref name=\"whitburn\"/><ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/dwight-yoakam-mn0000791483/biography | title=Dwight Yoakam biography | publisher=AllMusic | access-date=September 2, 2022 | author=[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]]}}</ref> He is the oldest of three children to David Yoakam and his wife, Ruth Ann Tibbs Yoakam.

Although Yoakam later broke this guitar, he received another one as a Christmas present while he was in the fourth grade. He also wrote his first song around this point.<ref name=\"roots\"/> As a child, Yoakam took influence from the music that his parents listened to on [[phonograph record|records]] as well as [[WMNI]], then an [[AM broadcasting|AM]] country music radio station in Columbus.<ref name=\"roots\"/> Among these records were compilations by [[Johnny Cash]] and [[Johnny Horton]].<ref name=\"roots\"/> According to his mother, the family would also sing songs to each other when on road trips to visit Yoakam's maternal grandparents. Yoakam himself also stated that he was influenced by [[rock and roll]] acts he had seen on television, such as [[Elvis Presley]].<ref name=\"roots\"/>\n\nThe Yoakam family moved to another neighborhood of Columbus in 1968, where Yoakam attended [[Northland High School]]. His mother encouraged all three of her children to join the school's band, in which Yoakam played drums. He also attended drama class at Northland High School, which led to him playing the role of Charlie in a production of ''[[Flowers for Algernon]]''. Yoakam later attributed this performance as giving him more confidence performing in front of others.<ref name=\"roots\"/> In his senior year of high school, Yoakam and some classmates formed a [[rock and roll]] band to compete in the school's talent show.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/><ref name=\"roots\"/> The band became popular enough that they began performing at a number of private parties throughout Columbus as The Greaser Band. Yoakam attended [[Ohio State University]], but quickly dropped out in order to focus on his musical career.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> While playing at a club in [[Gahanna, Ohio]], Yoakam was approached by a man who promised a musical contract but later turned out to be a [[con artist]]. Despite this, Yoakam chose to move to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], to continue pursuing a career in country music. He faced difficulty in the Nashville music scene, as his style was more indebted to [[honky-tonk]] and [[bluegrass music]] at a time when such sounds were not popular compared to [[country pop]] and [[Nashville sound]].<ref name=\"allmusic\"/>\n\nYoakam then moved to [[Los Angeles, California]], at the encouragement of Billy Alves, a former member of the Greaser Band. While he was initially unsuccessful there as well, he met guitarist and record producer [[Pete Anderson]] at a Los Angeles bar in 1982. The two became friends when they realized they had common interest in musicians such as [[Merle Haggard]].<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> Anderson also observed that [[cowpunk]] and [[alternative country]] were popular in California through acts such as [[Joe Ely]], [[Rank and File (band)|Rank and File]], and [[Lone Justice]]. By performing at clubs where these acts also performed, Yoakam was thus able to gain further exposure.<ref name=\"roots\"/>\n\n==Musical career==\n===1984{{ndash}}1986: ''Guitars, Cadillacs, Etc., Etc.''===\n[[File:PeteAnderson(by Scott Dudelson).jpg|200px|thumb|right|[[Pete Anderson]], seen here in 2009, produced and played lead guitar on the majority of Yoakam's albums.|alt=Musician Pete Anderson playing an electric guitar.]]\nBy 1984, Yoakam had written a large number of songs. Anderson then encouraged him to record some of them on an [[extended play]]. He also served as producer and lead guitarist on the project, roles he would serve throughout most of Yoakam's career.<ref name=\"encyclopedia\"/> The EP was titled ''[[Guitars, Cadillacs, Etc., Etc.]]'' and was released through the [[Oak Records]] label. It consisted of five of Yoakam's original compositions, plus a cover of [[Johnny Cash]]'s \"[[Ring of Fire (song)|Ring of Fire]]\".<ref name=\"roots\"/> Songs from the extended play received airplay on independent radio stations throughout Los Angeles.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> Later in the year Yoakam was chosen to serve as an opening act for [[The Blasters]]. This led to him being discovered by [[Reprise Records]] executive Paige Levy, who helped Yoakam sign with the label in 1986.<ref name=\"roots\"/> Reprise re-issued ''Guitars, Cadillacs, Etc., Etc.'' that year with four more tracks, thus making it his debut album.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> One of the added tracks was \"Bury Me\", a duet with [[Maria McKee]].<ref name=\"etc review\"/> The first single off the album was a cover of [[Johnny Horton]]'s 1956 single \"[[Honky-Tonk Man|Honky Tonk Man]]\".
