Growing up in [[Calgary]], he was a pediatric [[Registered nurse|nurse]] at the time of his big break. In 1996, he made his mark on the country music charts with the single \"[[My Heart Has a History]]\", propelling him to international success and making him the first male Canadian country singer to reach the Top 10 on the Billboard [[Hot Country Songs]] chart in the United States since [[Hank Snow]] in 1974.\n\n==Early life==\nBrandt was born in [[Calgary]], Alberta and grew up in nearby [[Airdrie, Alberta|Airdrie]]. The first time Brandt sang in front of an audience was when he sang \"[[Amazing Grace]]\" at his [[Crescent Heights High School (Calgary)|high school]]. He attended [[Crescent Heights High School (Calgary, Alberta)|Crescent Heights High School]] from 1987-1990.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} He also graduated from Mount Royal University with a major in nursing during 1992.\n\n==Career==\n\nBrandt's demo was one of many sent by A&Rs at the [[Warner Music Canada|Warner Canada]] office to their colleagues at Warner Nashville with a purpose of finding a new project that the two branches could work on together.<ref name=\"hitquarters\">{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_PLevy.html |title=Interview With Paige Levy |publisher=[[HitQuarters]] |date=November 27, 2000 |access-date=May 6, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170906182931/http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview%2Fopar%2Fintrview_PLevy.html |archive-date=September 6, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Nashville A&R Paige Levy singled out Brandt's recordings, later mentioning to [[HitQuarters]] about his great potential as a [[songwriter]].<ref name=\"hitquarters\"/> As a result, the artist started travelling down to Nashville to undergo development. He was matched up with various experienced songwriters whom he could relate to, work well with and who would help him to refine his writing skills. This collaborations resulted in a large part of the material for Brandt's debut album ''[[Calm Before the Storm (Paul Brandt album)|Calm Before the Storm]]''.<ref name=\"hitquarters\"/>\n\nBrandt's first single, \"[[My Heart Has a History]],\" was a number 1 hit in Canada, as was his debut album, \"Calm Before The Storm\". He followed up with the three hits \"[[I Do (Paul Brandt song)|I Do]]\" (which he wrote for his friend's wedding), \"[[I Meant to Do That]]\" and \"[[Take It From Me (Paul Brandt song)|Take It from Me]].\" ''Calm Before the Storm'' was certified Gold by the RIAA in 1997.\n\nBrandt's second album, ''[[Outside the Frame]]'', did not repeat the same success as ''Calm Before the Storm'' did. The album did have some hit singles, most notably \"[[A Little in Love (Paul Brandt song)|A Little in Love]]\" and \"What's Come Over You.\" Determined to put his stamp in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], Brandt recorded his third album, ''[[That's the Truth (album)|That's the Truth]]'', in 1999. It was not received as warmly as the previous two, but the songs \"[[That's the Truth (Paul Brandt song)|That's the Truth]]\" and \"The Sycamore Tree\" became popular. After three albums, he released the Canada only greatest hits compilation, ''[[What I Want to Be Remembered For]]'', in 2000.\n\nAfter the greatest hits album, Brandt left [[Warner Records|Warner]] / [[Reprise Records]] and started his own label, ''Brand-T Records''.  To date, every album that Brandt has released on Brand-T Records has garnered an Album of the Year award (Small Towns & Big Dreams (2002 [[Canadian Country Music Awards|CCMA's]]), This Time Around (2005 CCMA's), Risk (2008 Juno), and A Gift ([[GMA Canada|GMA]] - Seasonal Recording of the Year).\n\nAs an unsigned artist, his live acoustic album ''[[Small Towns and Big Dreams]]'' went on to win the CCMA Album of the Year.  His label's success has continued as the follow-up album ''[[This Time Around (Paul Brandt album)|This Time Around]]'' went on to win [[Canadian Country Music Awards|CCMA]] Album of the Year and a [[GMA Canada|GMA Canada Covenant Award]] for the song \"That's What I Love About Jesus\" (2005). ''This Time Around'' went [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]] in Canada and also produced the hit songs \"Leavin'\", featuring [[Keith Urban]] courtesy Capitol Records, and his remake of the trucker classic song \"[[Convoy (song)|Convoy]].\" His last single/video from the album was \"Alberta Bound,\" a tribute to the people and places of that province. Despite the song's name, it is not a remake of the [[Gordon Lightfoot]] track.\n\nIn September 2007 Brandt released his album, ''[[Risk (Paul Brandt album)|Risk]]''. On April 6, 2008, he won a [[Juno Awards of 2008|Juno Award]] for \"Risk\" as [[Juno Award for Country Recording of the Year|Country Recording of the Year]] in his home town . The first single for this project, \"[[Didn't Even See the Dust]],\" was released to country radio in May 2007. The video was filmed in [[Barcelona|Barcelona, Spain]]. \"Dust\" was one of the 20 most played country music songs of 2007 in Canada.<ref>[http://www.radioandrecords.com/Formats/Charts/YearEnd/07/Canada_Country_songs.asp R&R Top Canada Country Songs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305023257/http://www.radioandrecords.com/Formats/Charts/YearEnd/07/Canada_Country_songs.asp |date=March 5, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nBrandt released the album ''[[Give It Away (Paul Brandt album)|Give It Away]]'' on September 13, 2011.
