They recorded three [[studio album]]s: ''[[Trick Pony (album)|Trick Pony]]'', ''[[On a Mission (Trick Pony album)|On a Mission]]'', and ''[[R.I.D.E.]]'', released in 2001, 2002, and 2005. These albums produced eight [[single (music)|singles]] on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] chart, including four Top 20 hits: \"[[Pour Me (Trick Pony song)|Pour Me]]\", \"[[On a Night like This (Trick Pony song)|On a Night like This]]\", \"[[Just What I Do]]\", and \"On a Mission\".\n\nIn 2006, Newfield departed for a solo career and Aubrey Collins replaced her as lead vocalist. The group disbanded after Collins and Dean left in 2007 and 2008. Newfield released a solo debut album, ''[[What Am I Waiting For]]'', in 2008 on [[Curb Records]], while Burns joined singer Michelle Poe to form a duo called [[Burns & Poe]]. Burns, Dean, and Newfield reformed the group in late 2013, although Dean left again in 2014. The revived lineup released one more album, ''Pony Up'', via Permian Records in 2016.\n\n==History==\nTrick Pony was formed in 1996 by guitarist Keith Burns and bass guitarist Ira Dean. Both musicians had experience as backing musicians for other country music acts: Burns had previously worked with [[Joe Diffie]], and Dean with [[Tanya Tucker]].<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p458006|pure_url=yes}} |title=Trick Pony biography |accessdate=2007-12-18 |last=Huey |first=Steve |work=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> Keith and Ira decided to form a group composed of two men and a woman.
