Active since 1968, Stuart initially toured with [[Lester Flatt]], and then in [[Johnny Cash]]'s road band before beginning work as a solo artist in the early 1980s. He is known for his combination of [[rockabilly]], [[country rock]], and [[bluegrass music]] influences, his frequent collaborations and cover songs, and his distinctive stage dress.\n\nHis greatest commercial success came in the first half of the 1990s on [[MCA Records]] Nashville. Stuart has recorded over 20 studio albums, and has charted over 30 times on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts. His highest chart entry is \"[[The Whiskey Ain't Workin']]\", a duet with [[Travis Tritt]]. \n\nStuart has won five [[Grammy Award]]s out of 16 nominations.

While a member of this band, Stuart met mandolinist [[Roland White]], a member of [[Lester Flatt]]'s backing band; White invited Stuart to perform with Flatt at a concert in Delaware in 1972, which led to him becoming a regular member of that band. He continued to tour in this capacity until Flatt retired in 1978, and recorded an independent album called ''With a Little Help from My Friends'' that same year. After this, Stuart performed with [[Vassar Clements]] and [[Doc Watson]] before joining [[Johnny Cash]]'s band in 1980.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> \n\nIn 1982, he released a second album called ''Busy Bee Cafe'' on [[Sugar Hill Records (bluegrass)|Sugar Hill Records]]. The album was composed of a [[jam session]] that included a number of country and bluegrass performers such as Cash, Watson, and [[Earl Scruggs]]. In 1985, Stuart accompanied Johnny Cash to Memphis and played on the ''Class of '55'' album that also featured [[Carl Perkins]], [[Roy Orbison]], and [[Jerry Lee Lewis]]. At the end of the session, Perkins presented Stuart with his guitar.<ref>Dickerson, James L., ''Goin' Back to Memphis: A Century of Blues, Rock 'n' Roll and Glorious Soul'', Schirmer Books, 1996, pg. 12</ref> Later that year, Stuart left Cash's band and landed a recording contract with [[Columbia Records]].<ref name=\"allmusic\"/>\n\n==Recording career==\nStuart released his [[Marty Stuart (album)|self-titled debut album]] on Columbia in 1985. The album accounted for Stuart's first chart entry on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts with his first single release, \"[[Arlene (song)|Arlene]]\".<ref name=\"whitburn\"/> Three other singles charted from the album in 1986: \"Honky Tonker\" and \"All Because of You\", both written by [[Steve Forbert]], and Stuart's own \"Do You Really Want My Lovin'\". However, these songs were less successful on the charts.<ref name=\"whitburn\"/> The success of \"Arlene\" helped Marty to receive a nomination by the [[Academy of Country Music Awards]] for [[Academy of Country Music Award for New Male Artist of the Year|Top New Male Vocalist]], losing to [[Randy Travis]]. [[AllMusic]] writer Jim Worbois gave the album a mixed review, stating that it was \"Not a great album, but made somewhat more interesting by some of the people appearing on the record and the inclusion of two Steve Forbert songs.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/marty-stuart-mw0000083078 | title=''Marty Stuart'' review | publisher=AllMusic | access-date=August 12, 2020 | author=Jim Worbois}}</ref> He recorded a second album for Columbia titled ''[[Let There Be Country]]'', which charted two singles in 1988: the [[Merle Haggard]] composition \"Mirrors Don't Lie\" and \"Matches\".<ref name=\"whitburn\"/> Due to the underperformance of the singles, Columbia chose not to release the album, and Stuart exited the label to return to Mississippi.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/>\n\n===1989-91: Beginning of MCA Records tenure===\nAfter briefly rejoining the Sullivans, he returned to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] and signed with [[MCA Records]] in 1989.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> That label issued the album ''[[Hillbilly Rock]]'' that year.

While these were unsuccessful on the charts, the album's [[Hillbilly Rock (song)|title track]] (written by [[Paul Kennerley]]) became Stuart's first top-ten country hit in 1990.<ref name=\"whitburn\"/> The album's final release was \"[[Western Girls (Marty Stuart song)|Western Girls]]\", which Stuart also co-wrote.<ref name=\"whitburn\"/> ''Hillbilly Rock'' was certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) in 1997 for shipments of 500,000 copies.<ref name=\"riaa\">{{cite web | url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&se=marty+stuart#search_section | title=Search results for Marty Stuart | publisher=Recording Industry Association of America | access-date=August 14, 2020}}</ref>\n\nHis second MCA album, ''[[Tempted (Marty Stuart album)|Tempted]]'', followed in 1991.
