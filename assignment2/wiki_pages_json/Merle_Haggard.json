His childhood was troubled after the death of his father, and he was incarcerated several times in his youth. After being released from [[San Quentin State Prison]] in 1960, he managed to turn his life around and launched a successful country music career. He gained popularity with his songs about the working class; these occasionally contained themes contrary to the anti–[[Vietnam War]] sentiment of some popular music of the time. Between the 1960s and the 1980s he had 38 number-one hits on the US country charts, several of which also made the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' all-genre singles chart]]. Haggard continued to release successful albums into the 2000s.\n\nHe received many honors and awards for his music, including a [[Kennedy Center Honors|Kennedy Center Honor]] (2010); a [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] (2006); a [[BMI Awards|BMI Icon Award]] (2006);<ref name=bmiawards /> and induction into the [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]] (1977);<ref name=nashvillehof>{{cite web|url=http://nashvillesongwritersfoundation.com.s164288.gridserver.com/Site/inductee?entry_id=2344|title=Merle Haggard|website=[[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]]|access-date=April 9, 2016|quote=Induction year: 1977|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150727055941/http://nashvillesongwritersfoundation.com.s164288.gridserver.com/Site/inductee?entry_id=2344|archive-date=July 27, 2015}}</ref> [[Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum|Country Music Hall of Fame]] (1994)<ref name=countrymusichof>{{cite web|url=http://countrymusichalloffame.org/full-list-of-inductees/view/merle-haggard |title=Full List of Inductees |publisher=Country Music Hall of Fame |date=2010 |access-date=April 16, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130331231437/http://countrymusichalloffame.org/full-list-of-inductees/view/merle-haggard |archive-date=March 31, 2013}}</ref> and [[Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame]] (1997).<ref name=okmusichof>{{cite web|url=http://www.omhof.com/Inductees/tabid/56/ItemID/54/Default.aspx|title=Inductees|website=Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame|access-date=April 16, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130419195117/http://www.omhof.com/Inductees/tabid/56/ItemID/54/Default.aspx|archive-date=April 19, 2013}}</ref> He died on April 6, 2016—his 79th birthday—at his ranch in [[Shasta County, California]], having recently suffered from [[Classification of pneumonia#Double pneumonia (bilateral pneumonia)|double pneumonia]].<ref name=nytobit>{{cite news|last=Friskics-Warren|first=Bill|title=Merle Haggard, Country Music's Outlaw Hero, Dies at 79|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/07/arts/music/merle-haggard-country-musics-outlaw-hero-dies-at-79.html?_r=0|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=April 6, 2016|access-date=April 7, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n{{external media | width = 210px | float = right | audio1 = [https://freshairarchive.org/segments/country-music-legend-merle-haggard-1 Country Music Legend Merle Haggard], interviewed by [[Terry Gross]] on ''[[Fresh Air]]'', 42:14, August 14, 1995.<ref name=\"Fresh Air\">{{cite interview |last=Haggard |first=Merle |interviewer=Terry Gross |title=Country Music Legend Merle Haggard |url=https://freshairarchive.org/segments/country-music-legend-merle-haggard-1 |work=[[Fresh Air]] |publisher=[[WHYY-FM|WHYY]] ([[NPR]]) |date=August 14, 1995 |access-date=September 15, 2019}}</ref>}}\n\nHaggard's parents were Flossie Mae (née Harp; 1902–1984) and James Francis Haggard (1899–1946).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://merlehaggard.com/bio|title=Haggard bio|publisher=Merlehaggard.com|access-date=June 2, 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626141355/http://merlehaggard.com/bio|archive-date=June 26, 2015}}</ref> The family moved to California from their home in [[Checotah, Oklahoma]], during the Great Depression, after their barn burned in 1934.{{sfn|Cusic|2002|p=XVII}}\n\nThey settled with their two elder children, James 'Lowell' (1922–1996) and Lillian, in an apartment in [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]], while James started working for the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway|Santa Fe Railroad]].

After another escape, he was sent to the [[Preston School of Industry]], a high-security installation. He was released 15 months later but was sent back after beating a local boy during a burglary attempt. After Haggard's release, he and Teague saw Lefty Frizzell in concert. The two sat backstage, where Haggard began to sing along. Hearing the young man from the stage, Frizzell refused to go on unless Haggard was allowed to sing first. Haggard did, and was well received by the audience. After this experience Haggard decided to pursue a career in music.

Soon, he was performing again and later began recording with Tally Records. The [[Bakersfield sound]] was developing in the area as a reaction against the overproduced [[Nashville sound]].{{sfn|Cusic|2002|pp=XXIII–XXVI}} Haggard's first record for Tally was \"Singing My Heart Out\" backed by \"Skid Row\"; it was not a success, and only 200 copies were pressed. In 1962, Haggard wound up performing at a [[Wynn Stewart]] show in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] and heard Wynn's \"Sing a Sad Song\". He asked for permission to record it, and the resulting single was a national hit in 1964. The following year, he had his first national top-10 record with \"[[(My Friends Are Gonna Be) Strangers]],\" written by [[Liz Anderson]], mother of country singer [[Lynn Anderson]], and his career was off and running.{{sfn|Cusic|2002|pp=XXVII–XXVIII}} Haggard recalls having been talked into visiting Anderson—a woman he did not know—at her house to hear her sing some songs she had written. \"If there was anything I didn't wanna do, it was sit around some danged woman's house and listen to her cute little songs. But I went anyway. She was a pleasant enough lady, pretty, with a nice smile, but I was all set to be bored to death, even more so when she got out a whole bunch of songs and went over to an old pump organ.... There they were. My God, one hit right after another. There must have been four or five number one songs there....\"{{sfn|Haggard|Russell|1981}}\n\nIn 1967, Haggard recorded \"[[I'm a Lonesome Fugitive]]\" with [[The Strangers (American band)|the Strangers]], also written by Liz Anderson, with her husband Casey Anderson, which became his first number-one single.<ref name=RS15>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/12-most-badass-merle-haggard-prison-songs-20150406/im-a-lonesome-fugitive-20150406|title=12 Most Badass Merle Haggard Prison Songs|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=April 6, 2015|access-date=April 6, 2016}}</ref> When the Andersons presented the song to Haggard, they were unaware of his prison stretch.{{sfn|Cantwell|2013|p=103}} [[Bonnie Owens]], Haggard's backup singer and then-wife, is quoted by music journalist Daniel Cooper in the liner notes to the 1994 retrospective ''Down Every Road'': \"I guess I didn't realize how much the experience at San Quentin did to him, 'cause he never talked about it all that much ... I could tell he was in a dark mood ... and I said, 'Is everything okay?' And he said, 'I'm really scared.' And I said, 'Why?'

In 2013, Haggard biographer David Cantwell stated, \"The immediate successors to ''I'm a Lonesome Fugitive''—''Branded Man'' in 1967 and, in '68, ''[[Sing Me Back Home]]'' and ''[[The Legend of Bonnie and Clyde]]''—were among the finest albums of their respective years.\"{{sfn|Cantwell|2013|p=125}} Haggard's new recordings showcased his band the Strangers, specifically [[Roy Nichols]]'s [[Telecaster]], [[Ralph Mooney]]'s [[steel guitar]], and the harmony vocals provided by [[Bonnie Owens]].\n\nAt the time of Haggard's first top-10 hit \"[[(My Friends Are Gonna Be) Strangers]]\" in 1965, Owens, who had been married to [[Buck Owens]], was known as a solo performer, a fixture on the [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]] club scene and someone who had appeared on television. She won the new [[Academy of Country Music]]'s first ever award for Female Vocalist after her 1965 debut album, ''Don't Take Advantage of Me'', hit the top five on the country albums chart. However, Bonnie Owens had no further hit singles, and although she recorded six solo albums on Capitol between 1965 and 1970, she became mainly known for her background harmonies on Haggard hits such as \"[[Sing Me Back Home (song)|Sing Me Back Home]]\" and \"Branded Man\".<ref>{{Cite AV media notes|title=Queen of the Coast |year=2007 |url=http://www.dekedickerson.com/docs/DekeDickerson-BonnieOwens.doc |first=Deke |last=Dickerson |type=Liner notes |others=[[Bonnie Owens]] |publisher=Bear Family Records |location=Germany |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160207091721/http://www.dekedickerson.com/docs/DekeDickerson-BonnieOwens.doc |archive-date=February 7, 2016 }}</ref>\n\nProducer Ken Nelson took a hands-off approach to produce Haggard.

They bring him through the yard, and there's a guard in front and a guard behind—that's how you know a death prisoner. They brought Rabbit out ... taking him to see the Father, ... prior to his execution. That was a strong picture that was left in my mind.\"  In 1969, Haggard's first tribute LP ''[[Same Train, A Different Time|Same Train, Different Time: A Tribute to Jimmie Rodgers]]'', was also released to acclaim.\n\nIn the 1969 ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' review for Haggard and the Strangers 1968 album ''Mama Tried'', [[Andy Wickham]] wrote, \"His songs romanticize the hardships and tragedies of America's transient proletarian and his success is resultant of his inherent ability to relate to his audience a commonplace experience with precisely the right emotional pitch....

It was a semi-autobiographical musical profile of Haggard, akin to the contemporary ''Behind the Music'', produced and directed by Michael Davis. The 1973 [[recession]] anthem, \"[[If We Make It Through December]],\" furthered Haggard's status as a champion of the working class. \"If We Make It Through December\" turned out to be Haggard and the Strangers' final crossover pop hit.\n\nHaggard appeared on the cover of ''TIME'' on May 6, 1974.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19740506,00.html|title=TIME magazine cover|date=May 6, 1974|website=content.time.com|publisher=TIME|access-date=April 7, 2016}}</ref> He also wrote and performed the theme song to the television series ''[[Movin' On (TV series)|Movin' On]]'', which in 1975 gave him and the Strangers another [[Movin' On (Merle Haggard song)|number-one country hit]].{{sfn|Whitburn|2006| p=147}} During the early-to-mid-1970s, Haggard and the Strangers country chart domination continued with songs such as  \"Someday We'll Look Back,\" \"[[Grandma Harp]],\" \"[[Always Wanting You]],\" and \"[[The Roots of My Raising]]\". Between 1973 and 1976, he and the Strangers scored nine consecutive number-one country hits. In 1977, he switched to [[MCA Records]] and began exploring the themes of depression, alcoholism, and middle age on albums such as ''[[Serving 190 Proof]]'' and ''[[The Way I Am (Merle Haggard album)|The Way I Am]]''. Haggard sang a duet cover of [[Billy Burnette]]'s \"What's A Little Love Between Friends\" with [[Lynda Carter]] in her 1980 television music special, ''Lynda Carter: Encore!'' In 1980, Haggard headlined the ''[[Bronco Billy]]'' soundtrack alongside [[Ronnie Milsap]], which saw Haggard score a number-one hit with \"[[Bar Room Buddies]],\" a duet with actor [[Clint Eastwood]].<ref>[https://www.wideopencountry.com/tip-one-back-to-merle-haggard-and-clint-eastwoods-unlikely-hit-bar-room-buddies/ 'Bar Room Buddies' The Unlikely Clint Eastwood, Merle Haggard Hit From 'Bronco Billy']</ref>\n\nHaggard appeared in an episode of ''[[The Waltons]]'' titled \"The Comeback,\" season five, episode three, original air-date October 10, 1976.

The same year, he provided the narration and theme for the movie ''[[The Legend of the Lone Ranger]]''. The movie did not perform as well as expected attributing its commercial failure to the Wrather/Moore dispute which generated negative publicity. Haggard also changed record labels again in 1981, moving to Epic and releasing one of his most critically acclaimed albums, ''[[Big City (Merle Haggard album)|Big City]]'', on which he was backed by the Strangers.\n\nBetween 1981 and 1985, Haggard scored 12 more top-10 country hits, with nine of them reaching number one, including \"My Favorite Memory,\" \"Going Where the Lonely Go,\" \"Someday When Things Are Good,\" and \"Natural High\".  In addition, Haggard recorded two chart-topping duets with [[George Jones]]—\"Yesterdays' Wine\" in 1982—and with [[Willie Nelson]]—\"Pancho and Lefty\" in 1983. Nelson believed the 1983 [[Academy Award]]-winning film ''[[Tender Mercies]]'', about the life of fictional singer Mac Sledge, was based on the life of Merle Haggard.

These include:\n* [[Collin Raye]] recorded \"My Kind of Girl,\" which includes the line, \"How 'bout some music/She said have you got any Merle/That's when I knew she was my kind of girl.\"<ref name = yahr />\n* In 2000, Alan Jackson and George Strait sang \"Murder on Music Row,\" which criticizes mainstream country trends: \"The Hag wouldn't have a chance on today's radio/Because they committed murder down on music row.\"<ref name=yahr />\n* In 2005, the country rock duo [[Brooks & Dunn]] sang \"Just Another Neon Night\" off their ''Hillbilly Deluxe'' album. In the song, [[Ronnie Dunn]] said, \"He's got an Eastwood grin and a Tulare swagger/Hollerin' turn off that rap/And play me some Haggard.\" Brooks and Dunn also reference Haggard in 1993's \"Rock My World (little country girl)\" off their ''Hard Workin' Man'' album as they sing \"Acts like [[Madonna]] but she listens to Merle/Rock my world little country girl.\"<ref name=yahr />\n* In 2009, [[Jimmy Buffett]]'s song Wings refers to Haggard and his song Silver Wings in the verse \"''You have wings look and see, Silver wings like Merle and me''\".\n* [[LeAnn Rimes]] mentions him in her 2013 song, \"I Do Now\": \"Thank God for Merle Haggard, he's right, the bottle let me down.\"<ref name =yahr />\n* Gretchen Wilson's song \"Politically Uncorrect\" and Eric Church's song \"Pledge Allegiance to the Hag\" both contain tributes to Haggard, as well as featuring him as a guest vocalist.<ref name=yahr /> \n*Country singer [[David Nail]] references the Haggard song \"Mama Tried\" in the lyrics to his song \"The Sound of a Million Dreams\" from his 2011 album of the same name: \"...when I hear Mama Tried I still break down and cry And pull to the side of the road&nbsp;...\". The song was written by Phil Vassar & Scooter Carusoe.\n* In [[John Anderson (musician)|John Anderson]]'s song \"Honky Tonk Saturday Night\", he sings the lines, \"I went to the jukebox and played some Merle Haggard/Oh me and the waitress think he's outta sight\".\n* [[Cody Johnson]] centralizes Merle in his song \"Monday Morning Merle,\" with a reference in the chorus \"...turns up 'Misery and Gin,' here we are again - Monday Morning Merle.\"\n* Cody Jinks song Hippies and Cowboys has the following lyrics Some old drunk on a bar stool on a Merle Haggard tuneThat's my kind of room\"\n\nIn the 1970s, several rock acts responded in their own songs to Haggard's criticism of hippie counterculture in \"Okie from Muskogee\" and \"The Fightin' Side of Me\".  [[The Youngbloods]] answered \"Okie from Muskogee\" with \"Hippie from Olema\", in which, in one repetition of the chorus, they change the line, \"We still take in strangers if they're ragged\" to \"We still take in strangers if they're haggard.\"{{sfn|Cantwell|2013| p=174}} [[Nick Gravenites]], of [[Big Brother and the Holding Company]], paid Haggard a tongue-in-cheek tribute with the song, \"I'll Change Your Flat Tire, Merle,\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Ruhlmann|first=William|editor-last1=Bogdanov|editor-first1=Vladimir|editor-last2=Woodstra|editor-first2=Chris|editor-last3=Erlewine|editor-first3=Stephen Thomas|title=All Music Guide to the Blues |publisher=Backbeat Books|edition=3rd |date=2003|page=40|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=03_SyPiMaroC&q=haggard&pg=PA255|chapter=Big Brother and the Holding Company: Be a Brother|isbn=978-0807133149}}</ref> later covered by other artists including [[Pure Prairie League]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Palmer|first=Alan|editor-last1=Zunshine|editor-first1=Lisa|title=The Oxford Handbook of Cognitive Literary Studies|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2013|page=149|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1r1PBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA149|chapter=Chapter 7: \"Listen to the Stories!\": Narrative, Cognition, and Country-and-Western Music|isbn=978-0199978069}}</ref> Despite these critiques, the Grateful Dead performed \"Mama Tried\" over 300 times,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deaddisc.com/songs/Mama_Tried.htm|title=Mama Tried|website=deaddisc.com|publisher=The Grateful Dead Family Discography|access-date=April 7, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160328085006/http://www.deaddisc.com/songs/Mama_Tried.htm|archive-date=March 28, 2016}}</ref> and \"Sing Me Back Home\" approximately 40 times.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deaddisc.com/songs/Sing_Me_Back_Home.htm|title=Sing Me Back Home|website=deaddisc.com|publisher=The Grateful Dead Family Discography|access-date=April 7, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160328100123/http://www.deaddisc.com/songs/Sing_Me_Back_Home.htm|archive-date=March 28, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Southern rock]] band [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]] more respectfully referenced Haggard in their song, \"[[Nuthin' Fancy|Railroad Song]],\" which contains the lyric, \"Well I'm a ride this train Lord until I find out/What [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]] and the Hag was all about.\" Skynyrd also performed both a cover of \"[[Merle Haggard Presents His 30th Album|Honky Tonk Night Time Man]]\" and their own take on the song with \"Jacksonville Kid\" (found on the 2001 CD reissue of the album) on their album ''[[Street Survivors]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ching|first=Barbara|editor-last=Watts|editor-first=Trent|title=White Masculinity in the Recent South|publisher=Louisiana State University Press|date=2008|page=255|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=03_SyPiMaroC&q=haggard&pg=PA255|chapter=Where Has the Free Bird Flown?
