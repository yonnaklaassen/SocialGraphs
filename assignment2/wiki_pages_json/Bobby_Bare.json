That same year, the material was repackaged by Sears and released under the title ''Bobby In Song'' (SPS-115). These albums are not usually included in Bare's published discographies.\n\n==Career at RCA Victor (1962–1970)==\nBare's big break in [[country music]] came when [[Chet Atkins]] signed him to [[RCA Victor]]. His debut single for the label was 1962's \"Shame On Me\". Follow-up \"[[Detroit City (song)|Detroit City]]\" reached No. 6 Country,<ref name=\"jwcntry\"/> No. 16 Hot 100,<ref name=\"jwpop\"/> and in 1964 earned him a [[Grammy Award for Best Country & Western Recording]].  Then a surge of hits followed, including \"[[500 Miles Away from Home]]\" (based on a traditional folk ballad written by [[Hedy West]] as \"500 Miles\")<ref name=\"jwpop\"/> and [[Ian Tyson]]'s \"[[Four Strong Winds]]\". In 1965 he received two further Grammy nominations for Best Country & Western Vocal Performance and Best Country & Western single for the latter song. In 1966, he received a yet another Grammy Nomination for Best Country & Western Male Vocal Performance for his song \"Talk Me Some Sense\". He also recorded two duet albums with [[Skeeter Davis]]<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> and recorded six tracks as a trio with [[Norma Jean (singer)|Norma Jean]] and [[Liz Anderson]], which produced a major hit with \"[[The Game of Triangles]]\", a wife-husband-other woman drama that hit No. 5 on the ''Billboard'' chart and earned the trio a Grammy nomination. In 1968, he recorded an album with a group from England called The Hillsiders.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://alancackett.com/bobby-bare|title=Alan Cackett – Bobby Bare|website=alancackett.com|access-date=March 14, 2019}}</ref><ref>The English Countryside, RCA Victor SF-7918 (LSP-3896)</ref> In 1969, he had a Top 5 hit with [[Tom T.

One such song, \"[[Marie Laveau (song)|Marie Laveau]]\", topped the country chart in 1974; the song was Bare's only #1 hit.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> It was co-written by his friends Silverstein and Baxter Taylor, who received a BMI Award for the song in 1975.\n\nIn 1977, Bare released an entire album of songs by songwriter [[Bob McDill]] called ''Me and McDill'', which contained the popular hit \"Look Who I'm Cheatin' On Tonight.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/me-and-mcdill-mw0001520365|title=Me and McDill|website=AllMusic|access-date=November 30, 2019}}</ref>\n\nSilverstein penned other songs for Bare including a Grammy-nominated hit, \"Daddy What If\", which he recorded with his five-year-old son, [[Bobby Bare Jr.]]<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> The song was an immediate success as well, not only reaching No. 2 on the country charts, but nearly reaching the Top 40 on the pop charts. Bare's album, ''Sings Lullabys, Legends and Lies'', became his most commercially successful album, finding him a new audience with pop radio once again playing his songs and also gaining a new following with college kids.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> These songs, all 14 written or co-written by Shel Silverstein, however, would become Bare's last Top 10 hits.\n\t\nIn 1975 Bare recorded a children's album with his family, mainly of Silverstein songs, called ''Singin' in the Kitchen''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://countrymusichalloffame.org/artist/bobby-bare/|title=Bobby Bare &#124; Artist Bio}}</ref> It was nominated in Best Group category in Grammy Awards.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://musicianguide.com/biographies/1608004064/Bobby-Bare.html|title=Bobby Bare Biography|website=musicianguide.com}}</ref> \n\nHis biggest hits during this time included \"Alimony\" (1975), \"The Winner\" (1976), and \"[[Drop kick|Drop Kick]] Me, Jesus (Through The Goalposts Of Life)\" (an unusual [[Christians|Christian]]-[[American football|football]] [[waltz]], and a 1976 [[Grammy Award for Best Country Song|Grammy nominee for Best Country Song]]).<ref>{{cite news |last=Langer |first=Emily |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/goingoutguide/music/paul-craft-who-wrote-country-classics-including-dropkick-me-jesus-dies-at-76/2014/10/20/ca893f5e-5870-11e4-b812-38518ae74c67_story.html |title=Paul Craft, who wrote country classics including 'Dropkick Me, Jesus,' dies at 76 |date=October 20, 2014 |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |access-date=October 1, 2021}}</ref> In 1977 he recorded \"Redneck Hippie Romance\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Halsey |first=Derek |url=https://www.herald-dispatch.com/features_entertainment/george-jones-bobby-bare-to-headline-annual-concert-in-catlettsburg/article_c1d4e34c-8ff6-58d8-b08d-d536ee161446.html |title=George Jones, Bobby Bare to headline annual concert in Catlettsburg |date=September 5, 2010 |work=The Herald-Dispatch |access-date=October 1, 2021}}</ref> and \"Vegas\" (a duet with his wife Jeannie).\n\n==Career at Columbia (1978–1983)==\nBare signed with [[Columbia Records]] and continued to have hits like \"Sleep Tight Good Night Man\", which barely cracked the Top 10 in 1978, alongside continuing to score critical acclaim with his releases ''Bare'' and ''Sleeper Wherever I Fall''.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> In 1979, he started off [[Rosanne Cash]]'s career in a big way by being her duet partner on the Top 20 hit \"No Memories Hangin' Round\".<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> In 1980, he almost cracked the Top 10 with \"Numbers\", which came from his album ''Down and Dirty''.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> On that album, Bare started to experiment with [[Southern rock]], which continued with his following album, ''Drunk and Crazy'' (1980).<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> The next year, Bare returned to his country roots with his [[Rodney Crowell]]-produced album ''As Is'', featuring the single \"New Cut Road\". Bare was still doing well chartwise into the early 1980s. In 1983, his duet with [[Lacy J. Dalton]], \"It's A Dirty Job\", hit the Top 30. His last trip into the Top 30 came that summer with the novelty song \"The Jogger\". He also released \"Used Cars\", the theme song from the [[Used Cars|film of the same name]].\n\n==Film career==\nBare was also given an opportunity to star in movies. He acted in a [[Western (genre)|Western]] with [[Troy Donahue]], ''[[A Distant Trumpet]]'', and had a memorable scene being branded for desertion, and a few episodes of the TV series ''[[No Time for Sergeants]]''. He turned his back on [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] to pursue his country career.\n\n==Later country career (1983–present)==\nFrom 1983 to 1988, Bare hosted ''Bobby Bare and Friends'' on [[The Nashville Network]] which featured him interviewing songwriters who sang their hit songs on the show.\n\nIn 1985, Bare signed with [[EMI America Records]] where he scored three low-charting singles.\n\nIn 1998, he formed the band [[Old Dogs (group)|Old Dogs]], with [[Jerry Reed]], [[Mel Tillis]] and [[Waylon Jennings]].
