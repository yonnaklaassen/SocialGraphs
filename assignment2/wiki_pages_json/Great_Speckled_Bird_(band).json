[[Ian Tyson]] sang, played guitar and composed. [[Sylvia Tyson]] sang, composed and occasionally played piano. The other founding members were [[Amos Garrett]] on guitar and occasional vocals, [[Ben Keith]] on steel guitar, [[Ken Kalmusky]] on bass and Ricky Marcus on drums. They were named after the song, \"[[The Great Speckled Bird (song)|The Great Speckled Bird]]\", as recorded by [[Roy Acuff]] (1936).<ref>https://www.45worlds.com/78rpm/record/8740us {{Bare URL inline|date=August 2024}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nThe group was featured in the film ''[[Festival Express]]'', a documentary about the music festival of the same name that took place in 1970. The shows were scheduled, and the performers traveled by train, across Canada. In the film, Great Speckled Bird performs \"[[C.C. Rider]]\", along with [[Delaney Bramlett]] and members of the [[Grateful Dead]]. A performance of the [[Bob Dylan|Dylan]]/[[Richard Manuel|Manuel]] song \"[[Tears of Rage]]\", without the aforementioned accompaniment, is included in the extra features of the DVD release.\n\nIn 1970, the group became the house band for the television show ''Nashville North'', produced by the [[CTV Television Network|CTV network]] and filmed at the [[CFTO-TV]] studios in Toronto, which, after one season, became the ''Ian Tyson Show''.<ref>J.
