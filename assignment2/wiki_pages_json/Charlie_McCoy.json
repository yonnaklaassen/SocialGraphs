He is best known for his harmonica solos on iconic recordings such as \"[[Candy Man (Roy Orbison song)|Candy Man]]\" ([[Roy Orbison]]), \"[[He Stopped Loving Her Today]]\" ([[George Jones]]), \"[[I Was Country When Country Wasn't Cool]]\" ([[Barbara Mandrell]]), and others.  He was a member of the [[Progressive country|progressive country rock]] bands [[Area Code 615 (band)|Area Code 615]] and [[Barefoot Jerry]]. After recording with [[Bob Dylan]] in New York, McCoy is credited for unknowingly influencing Dylan to decide to come to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] to record the critically acclaimed 1966 album ''\"[[Blonde on Blonde]]\"''.\n\nA prolific session musician, McCoy performed on many recordings by established artists, including [[Elvis Presley]] (on eight of his film sound tracks), Bob Dylan, [[Johnny Cash]], [[Chet Atkins]], [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Roy Orbison]], [[Leon Russell]], and [[Loretta Lynn]]. In the recording industry, he was known as the \"utility man\" because of his ability to play with sufficient skill on many different instruments in addition to the harmonica; for example, he played trumpet on Dylan's \"[[Rainy Day Women ♯12 & 35]]\", saxophone on Roy Orbison's \"[[Oh, Pretty Woman]]\", and bass harmonica on [[Simon & Garfunkel|Simon and Garfunkel]]'s \"[[The Boxer]]\". For Elvis Presley's 1965 film [[Harum Scarum (soundtrack)]], he played guitar, harmonica, organ, and vibraphone. \n\nHe is a member of three halls of fame, including the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] and the [[West Virginia Music Hall of Fame]]; he was inducted into the [[Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum]] in 2007 as a part of a group of session musicians dubbed \"[[The Nashville A-Team]]\".<ref name=\"unsung\">{{cite web|last1=Gilbert|first1=Calvin|title=Unsung Heroes Honored at Musicians Hall of Fame Induction|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/1575159/unsung-heroes-honored-at-musicians-hall-of-fame-induction/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129003455/http://www.cmt.com/news/1575159/unsung-heroes-honored-at-musicians-hall-of-fame-induction/|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 29, 2016|publisher=Country Music Television|access-date=January 24, 2017| date=November 27, 2007}}</ref> For 19 years, McCoy worked as music director for Nashville's popular television show, ''[[Hee Haw]]''.

In 1949, at age 8, McCoy saw an advertisement in a comic book, that read: \"Learn to play harmonica in seven days or your money back.\"<ref name=\"boxtop\">{{cite book |last1=McCoy |first1=Charlie |last2=Stimeling |first2=Travis D. |title=Fifty Cents and a Box Top–The Creative Life of Nashville Session Musician Charlie McCoy |date=2017 |publisher=West Virginia University Press |location=Morgantown |isbn=9781943665716}}</ref>{{rp|3}} It required a box top from a cereal product plus 50 cents. When the instrument arrived, McCoy found it hard to get any music out of it, and lost interest.<ref name=\"boxtop\"/>{{rp|3}} Later, he moved to Florida to live with his father. On unpacking his suitcase, his father saw the harmonica. To McCoy's surprise, his dad picked it up and played \"Home Sweet Home\", both the melody and his own rhythmic accompaniment.<ref name=\"boxtop\"/>{{rp|5}} This was the first time anyone had shown him how the instrument is properly played. McCoy was amazed, and a spark was struck. He soon learned to play 4 songs that he performed at his elementary school assembly.<ref name=\"boxtop\"/>{{rp|5}} As he got older, he devoted himself to learning blues harmonica by listening to late-night radio broadcasts originating out of Nashville's [[WLAC]]. He acquired records of the great blues harmonica players by mail-order.<ref name=\"boxtop\"/>{{rp|11}}  He also learned to play the guitar, and in his teens, the bass and trumpet. While attending Southwest Miami high school, he put together a rock and roll band called \"Charlie McCoy and the Agendas\" as a guitarist and singer.<ref name=\"rodackinterview\">{{cite web |last1=Rodack |first1=Jaine |title=Harmonica Player of the Month: Charlie McCoy (Exclusive Interview) |url=https://www.harmonica.com/charlie-mccoy-interview-56591.html |website=harmonica.com |date=May 25, 2018 |access-date=November 29, 2018}}</ref> At age sixteen he accompanied a friend to a Miami-based country music barn dance radio show called the \"Old South Jamboree\". Upon their arrival, McCoy's friend left him in the crowd and went to talk to \"Happy\" Harold Thaxton, the host of the show, with the intention of coaxing the reluctant McCoy up on stage to sing. McCoy's performance that night, along with the positive response from the audience, led to the band, Charlie McCoy and the Agendas, being signed to the Old South Jamboree.<ref name=\"boxtop\"/>{{rp|20}} The band consisted of the following players: Donny Lytle, later known as [[Johnny Paycheck]] (bass); Bill Johnson (steel guitar); Charlie Justice (guitar); and Bill Phillips (vocals). Around the same time, the band also took part in a local rock and roll contest, winning first prize. \n\n==Development==\n\n[[File:Charlie McCoy03.JPG|thumb|left|200px| McCoy performing in Normandy, France, 1970]]Following an invitation from [[Mel Tillis]], the eighteen-year-old McCoy went to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], for a week's stay in 1959.<ref name=\"LarkinBlues\"/> During his visit he contacted numerous producers and record companies but to no avail. Discouraged, he returned to Miami.<ref name=\"LarkinBlues\"/> He enrolled at [[Miami University]], majoring in musical education.<ref name=\"rodackinterview\"/> His goal then was to become a music teacher. Meanwhile, he continued to perform on the \"Jamboree\". When the university's music faculty discovered that he was playing rock and roll for a square dance, they warned him not to continue with such \"lower forms of music\".<ref name=\"boxtop\"/>{{rp|30}} McCoy replied that he was willing to quit his work at the barn dance if they would give him a scholarship. The faculty rejected his request.<ref name=\"Bill Williams page 39\">Billboard December 21, 1974, ''His Monumental Ten Years by Bill Williams'', Nielsen Business Media, page 39</ref>\n\nMcCoy, who still wanted to make a career in music, decided to return to Nashville, a difficult decision, because it meant quitting college, and would disappoint his father.<ref name=\"boxtop\"/>{{rp|33}} Nevertheless, he applied for a job in Nashville as guitarist in Johny Ferguson's band. But when he arrived there, his job had already been taken. Ferguson felt bad about this, and decided to hire McCoy as a drummer instead.<ref name=\"LarkinBlues\"/> Unfortunately for McCoy, he had only rudimentary knowledge of drumming, but was desperate for a job. He bought a drum set and joined the group; unfortunately they were not well-received, and disbanded shortly thereafter their first job.<ref name=\"Bill Williams page 39\"/> McCoy said, \"Even though I was still learning to play the drums, I wasn't the worst musician in the group\".<ref name=\"boxtop\"/>{{rp|35}} After a month of unemployment he joined [[Stonewall Jackson (musician)|Stonewall Jackson]] as a drummer.<ref name=\"LarkinBlues\"/> The job came to an end in the autumn that year. He then received a call from the booking agent [[Jim Denny (Opry manager)|Jim Denney]], who informed him that [[Archie Bleyer]] of [[Cadence Records]] had listened to McCoy's tapes and wanted to sign him.<ref name=\"LarkinBlues\"/> McCoy cut his first single, \"Cherry Berry Wine\", for the Cadence label;<ref name=\"LarkinBlues\"/> it reached No.&nbsp;99 on the Billboard chart. In Nashville, Denney advised him to do demo sessions and to concentrate on the harmonica. Next, McCoy joined [[Wayne Moss]] as a bass player, performing at [[Fort Campbell]] in Kentucky.<ref name=\"Bill Williams page 41\">Billboard December 21, 1974, ''His Monumental Ten Years by Bill Williams'', Nielsen Business Media, page 41</ref>\n\n==Big break==\nChet Atkins heard one of McCoy's demo tapes and immediately hired him as a staff musician in May, 1961.  His first recording session for [[RCA Records|RCA]] as a harmonica player was with an unknown singer from Sweden named [[Ann-Margret]].  She was beautiful, and only 18 at the time. He accompanied her on the song \"I Just Don't Understand\"<ref name=\"windsorforbes\">{{cite journal |last1=Windsor |first1=Pam |title=Harmonica Extraordinaire Charlie McCoy On Recording With Elvis, Bob Dylan, Johnny Cash & Others |journal=Forbes |date=July 30, 2022 |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/pamwindsor/2022/07/30/harmonica-extraordinaire-charlie-mccoy-on-recording-with-elvis-bob-dylan-johnny-cash--others/?sh=3050b1d06257 |access-date=January 3, 2024}}</ref> [[Fred Foster]] of [[Monument Records]] then booked McCoy for McCoy's second session, this time with [[Roy Orbison]], which included the song, \"[[Candy Man (Roy Orbison song)|Candy Man]]\".<ref name=\"LarkinBlues\"/> As the veteran musicians were tuning up, Orbison sang the song for them, accompanying himself on guitar.<ref name=\"boxtop\"/>{{rp|52}} He said they needed to come up with an intro. McCoy immediately had an idea, but remained silent.<ref name=\"boxtop\"/>{{rp|52}} Nothing was happening, the clock was ticking, and no one had anything. Finally, he played a motif quietly for veteran session guitarist, [[Harold Bradley (guitarist)|Harold Bradley]], who said, \"Hey guys, Charlie has a great idea.\"<ref name=\"boxtop\"/>{{rp|52}} When the song became a million-seller, McCoy's performance drew notice by the music executives.<ref name=\"LarkinBlues\"/> He said, “After the song hit the radio, my phone started ringing ... and thank God, 61-years later, it's still ringing.”<ref name=\"windsorforbes\"/> He continued to record for the Monument label without a written contract. His ability to give a creditable performance on many different instruments made him a good man to have on any session, and he became known as the \"Utility Man\" by producers.<ref name=\"windsorforbes\"/> As examples, he played trumpet on Dylan's \"Everybody Must Get Stoned\", saxophone on Roy Orbison's \"Pretty Woman\", and bass harmonica on Simon and Garfunkel's \"The Boxer\". For Elvis Presley's 1965 film [[Harum Scarum (soundtrack)]], he played guitar, harmonica, organ, vibraphone.<ref name=\"windsorforbes\"/>\nAlthough some of his singles and albums at this time did not sell, Foster believed in McCoy's music.<ref name=\"Bill Williams page 41\"/> Tex Davis, the promoter for Monument Records, was persuaded by Charlie Dillard of WPFA to release \"Today I Started Loving You Again\" from McCoy's second LP as a single.

After the introduction, McCoy was surprised when Dylan said that he personally owned one of McCoy's records, \"Harpoon Man\".<ref name=\"boxtop\"/>{{rp|80}} Then Dylan said, \"Hey, I'm getting ready to record a song, why don't you grab that guitar and play along.\"<ref name=\"boxtop\"/>{{rp|80}} The song was \"Desolation Row\", and McCoy remembered that it was 11 minutes long.<ref name=\"windsorforbes\"/> It took only two takes.<ref name=\"boxtop\"/>{{rp|80}}  The success of this impromptu session is credited in part with Dylan later agreeing to come to Nashville to record, and doing so against the wishes of his label and management executives.<ref name=\"cmhofdylan\">{{cite web |title=Dylan in Nashville |url=https://countrymusichalloffame.org/exhibit/dylan-cash-and-the-nashville-cats-a-new-music-city/dylan-in-nashville/#:~:text=Nashville%20Skyline%2C%201969,which%20it%20took%20its%20name. |website=countrymusichalloffame.org |publisher=The Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum |access-date=January 3, 2024}}</ref> Several months later, McCoy got a call that Dylan was indeed coming to Nashville, and a date had been set. McCoy would be the session leader and was tasked with picking the musicians. It was a big deal back then, because Nashville's connection for recording with folk singers was not stellar.<ref name=\"windsorforbes\"/> \n\nIn 1966, Dylan recorded \"[[Blonde on Blonde]]\" in Nashville, his seventh studio album, a double LP.
