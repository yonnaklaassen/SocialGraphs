The band formed at [[San Marcos, Texas]] in the 1970s, and recorded several singles for \"D Records\" including the Strait-penned \"I Just Can't Go On Dying Like This\" and \"I Don't Want To Talk It Over Anymore\". After Strait attained status as the \"[[King of Country]]\", the group released an album of its own in 1995 featuring vocals from [[Darrell McCall]] and [[Mel Tillis]].\n\nThe band, originally known as \"Stoney Ridge\", performs such styles of traditional country music as [[honky-tonk]] and [[western swing]] and were influenced by such performers as [[Bob Wills]], [[Johnny Bush]], and [[The Strangers (American band)|The Strangers]].  Contemporaries of the band include [[Asleep at the Wheel]] and [[Jerry Jeff Walker]].\n\n==Background==\n\n===Origins===\nThe Ace in the Hole Band derived from the band \"Stoney Ridge,\" which was composed of [[Texas State University–San Marcos|Southwest Texas State University]] (now Texas State) students Ron Cabal (lead [[guitar]]), Mike Daily ([[steel guitar]]), Terry Hale ([[Bass guitar]]), Tommy Foote ([[drum kit|drums]]) and Jay Dominguez (lead vocals). Dominguez and Foote left the band after graduating in 1975, prompting a search for a new singer. The band members posted bulletins around the campus of Southwest Texas.<ref name=\"texas\"/> One was noticed by an [[agricultural science]] student, George Strait. He contacted the band and was hired after an audition. Soon after, the group was renamed \"Ace in the Hole\" and George quickly became the lead singer.<ref name=\"texas\">{{cite web |url=http://ctmh.its.txstate.edu/artist.php?cmd=detail&aid=310&start=0&letter= |title=Ace in the Hole Band |author=Grant Mazak |date=2006 |work=Texas Music History Online |publisher=Texas State University |access-date=December 8, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811234143/http://ctmh.its.txstate.edu/artist.php?cmd=detail&aid=310&start=0&letter= |archive-date=August 11, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe band regularly performed at Cheatham Street Warehouse in [[San Marcos, Texas]], where they debuted on October&nbsp;13,&nbsp;1975 along with new member Ted Stubblefield, who temporarily replaced Foote as the drummer. Acts such as [[Asleep at the Wheel]] and [[Jerry Jeff Walker]] also played at the forum. The band appeared at the locale nearly every week until the early 1980s, when they began touring with Strait. Drummer Foote returned to the lineup late in 1975<ref name=\"texas\"/> and remained as drummer until 1983 when he relinquished his position to become the band's road manager.<ref>{{cite news|last=Corcoran|first=Michael|title=San Marcos musicians discovered Strait; the rest is country music history|url=http://straitfever.homestead.com/aceintheholeband.html|access-date=2014-05-18|newspaper=Austin American-Statesman|date=2009-09-25}}</ref> Tommy Foote died in May 2024.\n\n===Recording===\nIn 1976, [[Pappy Daily]], the grandfather of band member Mike Daily, decided to record the group for his \"D Records\" label at a studio in [[Houston|Houston, Texas]]. At the first session, the band recorded [[Dallas Frazier]]'s \"Honky Tonk Downstairs\" (later recorded on Strait's 1981 debut album ''[[Strait Country]]'') and the Strait-penned \"I Just Can't Go on Dying Like This\" (later recorded on Strait's 2013 album ''[[Love Is Everything (George Strait album)|Love Is Everything]]''). The songs were released to radio stations in Texas and [[Oklahoma]]. In 1977, Bill Mabry was added to the lineup as a fiddle player and the band recorded their second single, which featured the songs \"Lonesome Rodeo Cowboy\" (later recorded on Strait's 1990 album ''[[Livin' It Up (album)|Livin' It Up]]'') and \"That Don’t Change the Way I Feel About You\" which was written by Strait. The next year, the band recorded the songs \"[[Right or Wrong (1921 song)|Right or Wrong]],\" and \"[[Little Liza Jane]]\",<ref name=\"texas\"/> which were later included on the 2005 D Records label release ''Complete D Singles Collection, Vol. 6: The Sounds of Houston, Texas''.<ref name=\"houston\"/> Strait re-recorded \"Right or Wrong\" in 1983 for his album ''[[Right or Wrong (George Strait album)|Right or Wrong]]'' and took it to number one on the country charts. \"The Loneliest Singer in Town\" and Strait's \"I Don’t Want to Talk It Over Anymore\" also came out of this session. The three songs composed by Strait were later released on his 1995 compilation album ''[[Strait Out of the Box]]''.<ref name=\"box\">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r223204|pure_url=yes}} |title=Strait Out of the Box |author=Bruce Eder |work=Allmusic.com |access-date=December 8, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981, after Strait signed with [[MCA Records]], the band began to tour with him and played the instrumentals on his recordings.
