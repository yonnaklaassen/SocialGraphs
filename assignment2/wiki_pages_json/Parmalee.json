They are signed to the Stoney Creek division of [[BBR Music Group]] and have released three studio albums: ''[[Feels Like Carolina]],'' ''[[27861]],'' and ''[[For You (Parmalee album)|For You]]''. The band has made eight entries on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] and [[Country Airplay]] charts, with three number one singles on the latter: \"[[Carolina (Parmalee song)|Carolina]]\" in 2013,  \"[[Just the Way]]\", a collaboration with [[Blanco Brown]], in 2021, and \"[[Take My Name]]\" in 2022. Two more singles have reached the Top 10: \"[[Close Your Eyes (Parmalee song)|Close Your Eyes]]\" (No. 4, 2014) and \"[[Already Callin' You Mine]]\" (No. 10, 2015).\n\n== Career ==\n=== Early years ===\nPrior to the formation of Parmalee, Matt and Scott performed with their father in a group entitled Jerry Thomas and the Thomas Brothers Band. When their father retired, they wanted to continue playing music so they started Parmalee, consisting of Matt and Scott Thomas, Josh McSwain, and Barry Knox.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thedaonline.com/arts_and_entertainment/parmalee-comes-to-morgantown/article_fa69824c-9c63-11e4-8d23-372279ab9bb6.html|title=Parmalee comes to Morgantown|last=Harless|first=Hannah|work=The DA Online|access-date=December 30, 2017}}</ref> Their first EP was titled ''Daylight''. The band drew attention from producer David Bendeth of [[RCA Records|RCA]]. Bendeth invited them to record three songs at Water Music Studios in [[Hoboken, New Jersey]], which led to a publishing deal with Los Angeles-based Windswept Publishing. Then came an invitation from Bendeth to record the remainder of the 12 songs that comprise the band's full-length debut album, ''Inside''. Following the release, Parmalee spent nearly 2 years touring and promoting their album.\n\nParmalee also released a live acoustic album entitled ''Unplugged'' and a documentary-style DVD, ''Inside Live''. In 2006, they went to Los Angeles to begin recording with producer Stevo Bruno. They split their time between touring the East Coast and recording in California. They recorded the majority of the tracks in Los Angeles (Nikki Sixx, bassist of Mötley Crüe, collaborated with Parmalee on several tracks, both writing and producing), then travelled to Nashville to write, produce, and mix the remainder of the record with producer Kevin Beamish. Parmalee released the EP ''Complicated'' in 2008.\n\n=== Shooting ===\nIn 2010, the band were victims of an attempted robbery.<ref name=wcti>{{cite web|last=Newell|first=Annette|title=Parmalee Band Member In Critical Condition|url=http://www.wcti12.com/Parmalee-Band-Member-In-Critical-Condition/-/13530288/13647622/-/j8avd5z/-/index.html|work=WCTI12|access-date=February 7, 2014|date=September 21, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131027013217/http://www.wcti12.com/Parmalee-Band-Member-In-Critical-Condition/-/13530288/13647622/-/j8avd5z/-/index.html|archive-date=October 27, 2013}}</ref> They had just finished playing at The Money, a bar in [[Rock Hill, South Carolina]], on September 21, and were in their RV when Dytavis Hinton and Demorrio Burris entered the vehicle with a handgun demanding money. Drummer Scott Thomas came out from the back of the bus with his own gun and told them to leave. According to the band, Burris opened fire and a gunfight erupted. Thomas was shot in the leg, stomach, and chest.<ref>{{cite web|title=Parmalee Drummer remains in intensive care following 3rd surgery {{!}} 9 On Your Side|url=http://www.wnct.com/story/20983127/parmalee-drummer-remains-in-intensive-care-following-3rd-surgery|access-date=November 13, 2013}}</ref> Burris was killed and Hinton wounded in the lower half of his body.

Alongside him the band recorded their hit \"Musta Had a Good Time\" in the back of their [[RV]]. The song led to both their production and record deals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vevo.com/watch/parmalee/introducing-parmalee/US58E1290335?source=instantsearch|title=Introducing Parmalee|publisher=vevo.com |year=2012|access-date=October 24, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe inspiration for \"[[Musta Had a Good Time]]\" came right from their own lives. When the band formed, they all moved into the same house and parties happened almost every night. Scott clarifies: \"I can say the car wasn't in the pool. My friend drove his truck into a small creek. That actually happened.  We had to get a tractor to pull it out.\" And when they shot the video, another party broke out until the owner of the house where the video was being shot asked them to leave. The band got kicked out of their own video shoot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://parmaleefans.blogspot.com/2012/10/parmalee-in-country-weekly.html|title=Parmalee in Country Weekly|publisher=parmaleefans.blogspot.com |date=October 9, 2012 |access-date=October 24, 2012}}</ref> \"'Musta Had a Good Time' describes that one epic party that all of us have either been to -- or hope to go to -- at some point in our lives,\" says Matt. \"It's that one party that becomes a legend in a small town.
