Prior to managing Tanya's career, Beau was a heavy equipment operator, so the family moved often as he sought better work. Her early childhood was spent primarily in [[Willcox, Arizona]],<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> where the only radio station in town, [[KHIL]], played country music. The Tuckers attended concerts of country stars such as [[Ernest Tubb]] and [[Mel Tillis]], and Tanya's sister [[LaCosta Tucker|LaCosta]] was praised in the family for her vocal abilities. At the age of eight, Tanya told her father that she also wanted to be a country singer when she grew up.\n\nWhen the Tuckers moved to [[St. George, Utah]], Juanita took Tanya to audition for the film ''[[Jeremiah Johnson (film)|Jeremiah Johnson]]''.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> Tanya did not win the bigger role for which she tried out, but she was hired, as was her horse, as a bit player.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> About this time, she also received one of her first musical breaks, when her father drove the family to [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] for the [[Arizona State Fair]], on the chance that the featured performer, country singer [[Judy Lynn]], could use Tanya in her show. Tanya sang for the fair's entertainment managers, and she was engaged to sing at the fair itself.\n\nTucker made her debut with Mel Tillis, who was so impressed by her talent that he invited her onstage to perform. In 1969, the family moved to [[Henderson, Nevada]], where Tucker regularly performed. Eventually, she recorded a demonstration tape that gained the attention of songwriter [[Dolores Fuller]], who sent it to producer [[Billy Sherrill]],<ref name=\"Tanya Tucker biography at Allmusic\"/> the head of [[artists and repertoire]] at [[Sony Music|CBS Records]]. Sherrill was impressed with the demo tape and signed the teenage vocalist to [[Columbia Records]].<ref name=\"Tanya Tucker biography at Allmusic\"/>\n\n==Career==\n===1972–1979: Teen country star===\n[[File:Tanya Tucker.png|thumb|upright|Tucker in a 1973 promotional portrait for Columbia Records.]]\nSherrill initially planned to have Tucker record \"[[The Happiest Girl in the Whole USA]]\", but she chose \"[[Delta Dawn]]\"{{snd}}a song Billy Sherrill heard [[Bette Midler]] sing on ''[[The Tonight Show]]''{{snd}}instead as her first single while [[Donna Fargo]], the writer of \"The Happiest Girl in the Whole USA\", released her own version as a single.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> Released in May 1972, the song became a hit, peaking at number six on the country chart and scraping the bottom of the pop chart. At first, Columbia Records tried to downplay Tucker's age, but soon word leaked out and she became a  sensation.<ref name=\"Tanya Tucker biography at Allmusic\" /><ref name=\"sunmorn\">Bob Schieffer. \"Legends: Tanya Tucker\" (interview), ''CBS Sunday Morning'', 2 August 2020.</ref> A year later, Australian singer [[Helen Reddy]] scored a number-one U.S. pop hit with her version of \"Delta Dawn\".\n\n\"I thank the lucky stars and the Good Lord for that song,\" Tucker told ''[[Nine-O-One Network Magazine]]'' in 1988. \"If I cut it now for the first time I think it would be a hit. I was fortunate to have latched onto that one, and that was all Sherrill's doing. If it hadn't been for Sherrill, I probably would have been a rodeo queen or something.\"<ref>Dickerson, James L.

Tucker's third single, \"What's Your Mama's Name\", became her first number-one hit in the spring of 1973.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> Two other number ones{{snd}}\"Blood Red and Goin' Down\" and \"[[Would You Lay with Me (In a Field of Stone) (song)|Would You Lay with Me (In a Field of Stone)]]\" followed, establishing Tucker as a major star.<ref name=\"Tanya Tucker biography at Allmusic\" />\n\nIn 1975, she signed with [[MCA Records]], where she had a string of hit singles that ran into the late 1970s.<ref name=\"Tanya Tucker biography at Allmusic\"/>\n\nAmong these hits was \"Lizzie and the Rainman\", which became a number-one country hit,<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> and also became Tucker's only top-40 pop music hit, peaking at number 37. It also peaked among the top 10 on the [[adult contemporary]] charts at the time. Tucker has a string of top-10 country hits under MCA between 1975 and 1978, including \"[[San Antonio Stroll]]\", \"[[Here's Some Love]]\", and \"[[It's a Cowboy Lovin' Night]]\".\n\nIn 1977, she recorded \"You Taught Me How to Cry,\" a duet with [[Hoyt Axton]] on his album ''Snowblind Friend.''\n\nIn 1978, she decided to radically change her image and cross over to rock with her ''[[TNT (Tanya Tucker album)|TNT]]'' album. Despite the controversy over the record and its sexy cover, it went gold the following year.<ref name=\"Tanya Tucker biography at Allmusic\"/>\n\nThe two hit singles from the album were \"I'm a Singer, You're the Song\", and \"[[Texas (When I Die)]]\". The latter reached number five on the country charts, and its B-side, \"[[Not Fade Away (song)|Not Fade Away]]\", a [[Buddy Holly]] cover, peaked at number 70 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]].\n\n===1979–1984: Sales decline and personal battles===\nBy the end of the 1970s, her sales were declining{{snd}}in 1980 she only had two hits, one of them was \"Can I See You Tonight?\". Also in 1980, she recorded a few singles with [[Glen Campbell]], with whom she was romantically linked.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> In addition to recording, she also made her feature-film debut in ''[[Hard Country (1981 film)|Hard Country]]'', although she did have small roles in ''[[Jeremiah Johnson (film)|Jeremiah Johnson]]'' (1972) and the television miniseries ''[[The Rebels (miniseries)|The Rebels]]'' (1979).<ref name=\"Tanya Tucker biography at Allmusic\"/>\n\nShe also had begun drinking in her late teens, and she explained how it started:  <blockquote>\n\n\"You send your ass out on the road doing two gigs a night and after all that adoration go back to empty hotel rooms. Loneliness got me into it.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> </blockquote>\n\nIn 1978, Tucker moved to Los Angeles to try, unsuccessfully, to broaden her appeal to pop audiences, and was quickly captivated by the city's nightlife. She also said that she \"was the wildest thing out there. I could stay up longer, drink more and kick the biggest ass in town.

Finally, in 1988, her family confronted her and persuaded her to enter the [[Betty Ford Center]].<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/>\n\n===1986–1997: Comeback===\nIn 1986, Tucker signed with [[Capitol Records]]; she returned to the charts with \"[[One Love at a Time]]\", which climbed to number three.<ref name=\"Tanya Tucker biography at Allmusic\" /> Her career was revitalized with 1986's ''[[Girls Like Me]]'', an album that spawned four top-10 country singles.

Between 1988 and 1989, Tucker enjoyed one of her most popular years on the charts, racking up eight country top-10 hits in a row. Her albums around this time were also achieving \"Gold\" certifications by the [[RIAA]], after selling 500,000 copies. A ''Greatest Hits'' album followed in 1989. It also contained a new single called \"[[My Arms Stay Open All Night]]\". Radio responded well; the song peaked at number two.\n\nIn 1988, Tucker was nominated by the [[Country Music Association]] for \"Female Vocalist of the Year\", and was nominated for other major awards during this time. Her contribution to the country music genre was rewarded when the Country Music Association voted her the \"Female Vocalist of the Year\" in 1991, though she missed the event, having just given birth to her second child.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> Eight consecutive singles reached the top 10 in the early 1990s, including \"[[Down to My Last Teardrop]]\", \"[[(Without You) What Do I Do with Me]]\", and \"[[Two Sparrows in a Hurricane]]\".<ref name=\"cmt bio\" /> In 1990, Tucker was named \"Female Video Artist of the Year\" by [[CMT (U.S. TV channel)|CMT]]. Although by the 1990s, she no longer had number-one hits, many singles came close peaking in the country top five, as well as the top 10. Tucker was one of the most successful female country artists at the time. She became one of the few teen stars to find success in her adult years.\n\nHer 1993 album ''[[Greatest Hits 1990-1992]]'' rose to number 15, and also went to number 18 on the Top Country Albums chart. Liberty Records was changed to Capitol Nashville in 1994.\n\nBy the 1990s, Tucker was a 20-year veteran in country music, though she was only in her mid-30s. In 1994, \"[[Hangin' In (song)|Hangin' In]]\" was her last top-five hit, as well as her last top-10 hit for a while. That year, she performed at the [[half-time]] show at [[Super Bowl XXVIII]]. In 1996, she was one of the top-10 most-played artists of the year, and at the time was also  [[Capitol Records]]' biggest signed female artist. In 1997, she returned to the top 10 on the country charts for the last time with the hit, \"[[Little Things (Tanya Tucker song)|Little Things]]\", which peaked at number nine. That year she was inducted into the [[Texas Country Music Hall of Fame]].\n\n===2000–present: Music career today===\n{{BLP sources section|date=January 2013}}\n[[File:TanyaRyman01122020.jpg|thumb|right|Tucker performing at the [[Ryman Auditorium]] in 2020.]]\nIn 2002, Tucker founded Tuckertime Records, allowing her to retain control of the recording process and release the singles she wished to release. The same year, she issued ''[[Tanya (album)|Tanya]]'', her first album in five years, which was distributed through Capitol Records.\n\nIn 2002, Tucker was ranked number 20 on CMT's 40 Greatest Women of Country Music. In 2005, she released an album, ''Live at Billy Bob's Texas''. In 2005, she also contributed two songs to a tribute album to [[Bob Wills]], called ''A Tribute to Bob Wills 100th Anniversary''. In 2005, she released a book, ''100 Ways to Beat the Blues on Fireside'', which included tips on shaking the blues, from some of Tucker's friends such as [[Willie Nelson]], [[Brenda Lee]], [[Little Richard]], and [[Burt Reynolds]].\n\nTucker recorded an album, ''Lonesome Town'', around 2007, but it has never been released. The same year, she recorded a live concert at the [[Renaissance Center]] in December. Tucker also sang a duet with country music artist [[Billy Joe Shaver]], of Shaver's song, \"Played the Game Too Long\", on his album, ''Everybody's Brother'', released in September 2007.\n\nIn 2009, Tucker signed a one-time deal with Saguaro Road Records<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.saguaroroad.com/|title=Saguaro Road website|website=Saguaroroad.com|access-date=3 May 2018|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170704212714/http://www.saguaroroad.com/|archive-date=4 July 2017}}</ref> from [[Time-Life]].
