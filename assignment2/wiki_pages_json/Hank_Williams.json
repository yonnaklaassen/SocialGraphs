He is regarded as one of the most significant and influential American singers and songwriters of the 20th century. Williams recorded 55 singles that reached the top 10 of the [[Hot Country Songs|''Billboard'' Country & Western Best Sellers chart]], five of which were released posthumously, and 12 of which reached No.1.\n\nBorn and raised in Alabama, Williams learned guitar from African-American [[blues]] musician [[Rufus Payne]]. Both Payne and [[Roy Acuff]] significantly influenced his musical style. After winning an amateur talent contest, Williams began his professional career in Montgomery in the late 1930s playing on local radio stations and at area venues such as school houses, movie theaters, and bars. He formed the [[Drifting Cowboys]] backup band, which was managed by his mother, and dropped out of school to devote his time to his career. Because his alcoholism made him unreliable, he was fired and rehired several times by radio station [[WSFA]], and had trouble replacing several of his band members who were drafted during World War II.\n\nIn 1944, Williams married [[Audrey Williams|Audrey Sheppard]], who competed with his mother to control his career. After recording \"Never Again\" and \"[[Honky Tonkin']]{{-\"}} with [[Sterling Records (US)|Sterling Records]], he signed a contract with [[MGM Records]]. He released the hit single \"[[Move It On Over (song)|Move It On Over]]\" in 1947 and joined the ''[[Louisiana Hayride]]'' radio program. The next year he released a cover of \"[[Lovesick Blues]]\", which quickly reached number one on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'s}} Top Country & Western singles chart and propelled him to stardom on the [[Grand Ole Opry]]. Although unable to read or [[musical notation|notate music]] to any significant degree, he wrote such iconic hits as \"[[Your Cheatin' Heart]]\", \"[[Hey, Good Lookin' (song)|Hey, Good Lookin']]{{-\"}}, and \"[[I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry]]\". In 1952, Audrey<!--She took the surname Williams after her marriage, thus, per https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Biography#People_with_the_same_surname, is referred to as \"Audrey\" from now on.--> divorced him and he married [[Billie Jean Horton]]. He was dismissed by the Grand Ole Opry because of his unreliability and alcoholism.\n\nYears of back pain, alcoholism, and prescription drug abuse severely compromised Williams's health, and at the age of 29, Williams suffered from heart failure and [[Death of Hank Williams|died unexpectedly]] in the back seat of a car near [[Oak Hill, West Virginia]], en route to a concert in [[Canton, Ohio]], on New Year's Day 1953. Despite his relatively brief career, he is one of the most celebrated and influential musicians of the 20th century, especially in [[country music]]. Many artists have covered his songs and he has influenced [[Chuck Berry]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Johnny Cash]], [[Bob Dylan]], and [[the Rolling Stones]], among others. He was inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] in 1961, the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 1970, the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1987, the [[Native American Music Awards]] Hall of Fame in 1999, and gained a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. In 2010, he was posthumously awarded a [[Pulitzer Prize Special Citation]] for his \"craftsmanship as a songwriter who expressed universal feelings with poignant simplicity and played a pivotal role in transforming country music into a major musical and cultural force in American life.\"\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Hank-Williams-Georgiana-House.jpeg|thumb|Williams's family house in [[Georgiana, Alabama]]]]\n\nHank Williams was born Hiram Williams on September 17, 1923, in the rural community of Mount Olive in [[Butler County, Alabama]].{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|p=6}} He was the third child of Jessie Lillybelle \"Lillie\" (née Skipper; 1898–1955) and Elonzo Huble \"Lon\" Williams (1891–1970).{{sfn|Koon, George William|2001|pp=4-6}} Williams was of [[English American|English ancestry]] and [[Welsh American|Welsh ancestry]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://birthplaceofwesternswing.com/williams.html#:~:text=Williams%20was%20born%20in%20Butler,Smith%20lumber%20company | title=Cowtown Birthplace of Western Swing - Hank Williams }}</ref><ref name=\"Breverton2009\">{{cite book |last1=Breverton |first1=Terry |title=Wales: A Historical Companion |year=2009 |publisher=Amberley Publishing Limited |isbn=978-1-4456-0990-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I2qoAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.abctales.com/story/carl-halling/luke-drifter-and-secrets-country | title=Luke the Drifter and the Secrets of Country &#124; ABCtales }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://birthplaceofwesternswing.com/williams.html#:~:text=Williams%20was%20born%20in%20Butler,he%20was%20of%20English%20ancestry | title=Cowtown Birthplace of Western Swing - Hank Williams }}</ref><ref name=\"Ribowsky\">{{cite book |last1=Ribowsky |first1=Mark |title=Hank: The Short Life and Long Country Road of Hank Williams |year=2016 |publisher=Liveright Publishing |isbn=978-1-63149-158-0 |page=15 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JeOaCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT15}}</ref>  Elonzo's family came from south and central Alabama,{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|p=5}} and his father fought during the [[American Civil War]], first on the Confederate side, and then with the Union after he was captured.{{sfn|Ribowsky, Mark|2016|p=15}} Elonzo was a [[railroad engineer]] for the W. T. Smith lumber company and was drafted during [[World War I]], serving from July 1918 to June 1919. He suffered severe injuries after falling from a truck, breaking his collarbone, and receiving a severe blow to the head.{{sfn|Koon, George William|2001|pp=4-6}}\n\nThe Williams' first child, Ernest Huble Williams, died two days after his birth on July 5, 1921. A daughter, Irene, was born a year later. Williams was named after [[Hiram I]] of the [[Books of Kings|Book of Kings]].{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|p=3}} His name was misspelled as \"Hiriam\" on his birth certificate, which was prepared and signed when he was 10 years old.{{sfn|Koon, George William|2001|pp=6–7}}  Williams was born with [[spina bifida occulta]], a birth defect of the [[spinal column]] that caused him lifelong pain and became a major factor in his later alcohol and drug abuse.{{sfn|Koon, George William|2001|p=10}} At the age of three, Williams sat with his mother as she played the organ at the Mount Olive Baptist Church. Lillie also joined singing the hymns that influenced the singer's later compositions. Williams received his first musical instrument, a harmonica, at the age of six.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|p=11}} As a child, he was nicknamed \"Harm\" by his family and \"Herky\" or \"Skeets\" by his friends.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|p=7}}\n\nWilliams's father frequently relocated for work, and as a result the family lived in several southern Alabama towns. In 1930, when Williams was seven years old, Elonzo began experiencing facial [[paralysis]]. After being evaluated at a [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Affairs]] clinic in [[Pensacola, Florida]], doctors determined that he had a [[brain aneurysm]], and Elonzo was sent to the VA Medical Center in [[Alexandria, Louisiana]].{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|p=9}} He remained hospitalized for eight years and was mostly absent throughout Williams's childhood. From that point on, Lillie assumed responsibility for the family.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|pp=8-10}}\n\nIn the fall of 1933, Williams was sent to live with his aunt and uncle, Walter and Alice McNeil, in Fountain, Alabama. Their daughter, Opal, went in exchange to live with Lillie to attend school in [[Georgiana, Alabama]]. Williams learned to play basic guitar chords from his aunt and listened to music that was played at dances and in area churches.{{sfn|Hemphill, Paul|2005|pp=18-21}} The following year, the Williams family moved to [[Greenville, Alabama]], where Lillie opened a [[boarding house]] next to the local [[cotton gin]].{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|pp=13-14}} The family later returned with Opal McNeil to Georgiana, where Lillie took several side jobs to support the family despite the bleak economic climate of the [[Great Depression]]. She worked in a [[cannery]] and served as a night-shift nurse in the local hospital. Their first house burned down, and the family lost their possessions. They moved to Rose Street on the other side of town, into a house which Williams's mother soon turned into another boarding house. The house had a small garden in which they grew diverse crops that Williams and his sister Irene sold around Georgiana.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|pp=10-14}} At a chance meeting in Georgiana, Williams's sister Irene met U.S. Representative [[J. Lister Hill]] while Hill was campaigning across Alabama. She told Hill that her mother was interested in talking to him about her problems. With Hill's help, the family began collecting Elonzo's [[disability pension]].{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|p=27}} Despite his medical condition, the family managed fairly well financially throughout the Great Depression.{{sfn|Hemphill, Paul|2005|pp=16-17}}\n\n{{Listen |filename=Hank Williams - My Bucket's Got a Hole in It.ogg|title=My Bucket's Got a Hole in It |description=The popular song \"My Bucket's Got a Hole in It\" became a hit for Hank Williams in 1949.}}\n\nThere are several versions of how Williams got his first guitar. While several prominent Georgiana residents later claimed to have bought it for him, his mother said she bought it for him and that she arranged for his first lessons.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|p=20}} Williams told [[Ralph Gleason]], who at the time was writing a weekly music column in the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', \"When I was about eight years old, I got my first git-tar. A second-hand $3.50 git-tar my mother bought me.\"{{sfn|Betts, Stephen L.|2019}} Gawky and shy, Williams attached himself to an old black man, [[Rufus Payne|Rufus \"Tee-Tot\" Payne]], a street performer whom Williams followed around town. Payne gave Williams guitar lessons in exchange for money or meals prepared by Lillie.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|pp=20-26}} Payne's basic musical style was [[blues]]; he repeatedly stressed the importance of maintaining good rhythm and time,{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|p=12}} and he added the showmanship of stoops, bows, laughs and cries to his performances.{{sfn|Hemphill, Paul|2005|p=23}} Later on, Williams recorded \"[[My Bucket's Got a Hole in It]]\", one of the songs Payne had taught him.{{sfn|Brackett, David|p=98|2000}} Williams was also influenced by country acts such as [[Roy Acuff]].{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|pp=21-23}} In 1937, Williams got into a fight with his physical education teacher about exercises the coach wanted him to do. His mother subsequently demanded that the school board terminate the coach; when they refused, the family moved to [[Montgomery, Alabama]].{{sfn|Masino, Susan|2011|p=11}} Payne and Williams lost touch, though Payne also eventually moved to Montgomery, where he died in poverty in 1939.{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|p=229}} Williams later credited him as the provider of the only musical training he ever had.{{sfn|Rankin, Allen|1951|p=3C}}\n\n==Career==\n===1930s===\n[[File:HankWilliams1938-Cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|Williams performing in Montgomery in 1938]]\n\nIn July 1937, the Williams and McNeils opened a [[boarding house]] on South Perry Street in downtown Montgomery. It was at this time that Williams decided to change his name informally from Hiram to Hank.{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|pp=19-21}} During the same year, he participated in a talent show at the Empire Theater and won the first prize of US$15 ({{Inflation|US|15|1937|fmt=eq|r=-2|cursign=$}}) singing his first original song \"WPA Blues\". Williams wrote the lyrics and used the tune of [[Riley Puckett]]'s \"Dissatisfied\".{{sfn|Koon, George William|2001|p=16}}\n\nHe never learned to read music; instead he based his compositions in storytelling and personal experience.{{sfn|Rankin, Allen|1951|p=3C}}\nAfter school and on weekends, Williams sang and played his [[Silvertone (instruments)|Silvertone]] guitar on the sidewalk in front of the [[WLWI (AM)|WSFA]] radio studio.{{sfn|Koon, George William|2001|p=28}} His recent win at the Empire Theater and the street performances caught the attention of WSFA producers who occasionally invited him to perform on air with Dad Crysel's band.{{sfn|Koon, George William|2001|pp=16-17}}\n\nIn August 1938, Elonzo Williams was temporarily released from the hospital. He showed up unannounced at the family's home in Montgomery. Lillie was unwilling to let him reclaim his position as the head of the household. Elonzo stayed to celebrate his son's birthday in September before he returned to the medical center in Louisiana.{{sfn|Hemphill, Paul|2005|p=30}}\n\nWilliams's successful radio show fueled his entry into a music career, and he started his own band for show dates, the [[Drifting Cowboys]]. The original members were guitarist Braxton Schuffert, fiddler Freddie Beach, and comedian Smith \"Hezzy\" Adair.{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|pp=20-21}} Originally billed as \"Hank and Hezzy and the Drifting Cowboys\", they frequently appeared as fill-ins at the local dancehall, Thigpen's Log Cabin, just out of Georgiana.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|p=37}} The band traveled throughout central and southern Alabama performing in clubs and at private gatherings. James Ellis Garner later played fiddle for him. Lillie Williams became the Drifting Cowboys' manager. Williams dropped out of school in October 1939 so that he and the Drifting Cowboys could work full-time. Lillie Williams began booking show dates, negotiating prices and driving them to some of their shows.{{sfn|Koon, George William|2001|pp=16-18}} Now free to travel without deference to Williams's schooling, the band could tour as far away as western Georgia and the [[Florida Panhandle]].{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|p=24}} The band started playing in theaters before [[film screening|the screening of films]] and later they played in [[honky-tonk]]s. Williams's alcohol use started to become a problem during the tours; on occasion he spent a large part of the show revenues on alcohol. Meanwhile, between tour schedules, Williams returned to Montgomery to host his radio show.{{sfn|Hemphill, Paul|2005|pp=34-37}}\n\n===1940s===\n[[File:Hank Williams Drifting Cowboys Cropped.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Williams, Sheppard, and the Drifting Cowboys band in 1951]]\nThe American entry into [[World War II]] in 1941 marked the beginning of hard times for Williams. While he was [[Selective Training and Service Act|medically disqualified from military service]] after falling from a bull during a [[rodeo]] in Texas and suffering a back injury, his band members were all [[Selective Training and Service Act|drafted]] to serve. Many of their replacements quit the band due to Williams's worsening alcoholism, and in August 1942 WSFA fired him for \"habitual drunkenness\". Backstage during one of his concerts, Williams met [[Roy Acuff]], who warned him of the dangers of alcohol, saying, \"You've got a million-dollar voice, son, but a ten-cent brain.\"{{sfn|Hemphill, Paul|2005|pp=39-40}}\n\nHe started a job as a shipfitter's helper for the [[Alabama Drydock and Shipbuilding Company]] at [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]] in 1942,{{sfn|Lipsitz|1994|p=26}} working there off and on for about a year and a half during the war. He also worked briefly at [[Kaiser Shipyards]] in Portland, Oregon, apparently lured by the free tickets, free accommodations, free training, and good wages offered by the company.{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|p=33}} In 1943, Williams met [[Audrey Williams|Audrey Sheppard]] at a [[medicine show]] in [[Banks, Alabama]]. According to Sheppard, she and Williams lived in a hotel in Mobile while they worked together at the shipyard for a short while.{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|pp=34-35, 38-39}} Sheppard told Williams that she wanted to help him regain his radio show, and that they should move to Montgomery and start a band. The couple were married in 1944 at a [[Texaco]] gas station in [[Andalusia, Alabama]], by a justice of the peace. The marriage was technically invalid, since Sheppard's divorce from her previous husband did not comply with the legally required 60-day reconciliation period.{{sfn|Koon, George William|2001|pp=23-24}}\n\nIn 1945, back in Montgomery, Williams returned to WSFA radio. He attempted to expand his repertoire by writing original songs,{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|p=42}} and he published his first songbook, ''Original Songs of Hank Williams'', containing \"I'm Not Coming Home Anymore\" and several more original songs,{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|pp=41-42}} nine in all, including one not written by him, \"A Tramp on the Street\".{{sfn|Williams, Hank|1945}} With Williams beginning to be recognized as a songwriter, Sheppard became his manager and occasionally sang and substituted on guitar when a band member did not make the show.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|pp=56-57}}\n\nOn September 14, 1946, Williams auditioned for Nashville's [[Grand Ole Opry]] at the recommendation of  [[Ernest Tubb]], but was rejected. After the failure of his audition, Williams and Audrey attempted to interest the recently formed music publishing firm [[Acuff-Rose Music]]. They approached [[Fred Rose (songwriter)|Fred Rose]], the president of the company, during one of his daily ping-pong games at WSM radio studios. Audrey asked Rose if her husband could sing a song for him at that moment, Rose agreed, and perceived that Williams had much promise as a songwriter.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|pp=58-60}} Rose signed Williams to a six-song contract, and leveraged this deal to sign Williams with [[Sterling Records (US)|Sterling Records]]. On December 11, 1946, in his first recording session, Williams recorded \"Wealth Won't Save Your Soul\", \"Calling You\", \"[[Never Again (Will I Knock on Your Door)]]\", and \"When God Comes and Gathers His Jewels\", which was misprinted as \"When God Comes and ''Fathers'' His Jewels\".{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|pp=59-60}} The Sterling releases of Williams's songs became successful, and Rose decided to find a larger label for future releases. The producer then approached the newly formed recording division of the [[Loews Corporation]], [[MGM Records]].{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|pp=64-65}}\n{{Listen |filename=Lovesick Blues Hank Williams.ogg |title=Lovesick Blues |description=A major hit for Hank Williams, \"[[Lovesick Blues]]\" moved him to the mainstream of country music and assured him a position in the [[Grand Ole Opry]].}}\n\nWilliams signed with MGM Records in 1947 and released \"[[Move It On Over (song)|Move It on Over]]\", which became a country hit.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|pp=66-67}} In 1948, he moved to [[Shreveport, Louisiana]], and joined the ''[[Louisiana Hayride]]'', a radio show broadcast on [[KWKH]] that brought him into living rooms all over the Southeastern United States, appearing in weekend shows. As part of the arrangement, Williams got a program on the station and bookings through the ''Hayride''{{'s}} artist service to perform across western Louisiana and eastern Texas, always returning on Saturdays for the show's weekly broadcast.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|pp=69-71}} After a few more moderate hits, in 1949 he released his version of the 1922 [[Cliff Friend]] and [[Irving Mills]] song \"[[Lovesick Blues]]\", made popular by [[Rex Griffin]].{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|pp=98-99}} Williams's version was a hit; the song stayed at number one on the ''Billboard'' charts for four consecutive months.{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|pp=100}} Following the success of the releases of \"Lovesick Blues\" and \"[[Wedding Bells (Hank Williams song)|Wedding Bells]]\", Williams signed a management contract with Oscar Davis. Davis then booked the singer on a ''Grand Ole Opry'' package show, and he later negotiated Williams's induction into the musical troupe.{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|pp=109, 113, 116}}\n\nOn June 11, 1949, Williams made his debut at the Grand Ole Opry, where he received six [[encore]]s.{{sfn|Koon, George William|2001|pp=41-42}} He brought together Bob McNett (guitar), [[Hillous Butrum]] ([[Double bass|bass]]), [[Jerry Rivers]] ([[fiddle]]) and [[Don Helms]] ([[steel guitar]]) to form the most famous version of the Drifting Cowboys.{{sfn|Koon, George William|2001|pp=46-50}} That year Audrey Williams gave birth to Randall Hank Williams ([[Hank Williams Jr.]]).{{sfn|Koon, George William|2001|p=43}} During 1949, he joined the Grand Ole Opry's first European tour, performing in military bases in Germany and Austria.{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|p=131}} Williams had five songs that ranked in the top five ''Billboard'' Hot Country Singles that year including:  \"Wedding Bells\", \"[[Mind Your Own Business]]\", \"[[You're Gonna Change (Or I'm Gonna Leave)]]\", \"[[My Bucket's Got a Hole in It]]\", and \"Lovesick Blues\", which reached No. 1.{{sfn|Young, William H.|Young, Nancy K.|2010|p=235}}\n\n===1950s===\nBy 1950, Williams earned an estimated $1,000 per show ({{Inflation|US|1000|1950|fmt=eq|r=-2|cursign=$}}).{{sfn|Koon, George William|2001|p=50}} That year, he began recording as \"Luke the Drifter\" for his moral-themed songs, many of which are recitations rather than singing. Fred Rose had been concerned how it would affect the jukebox operators who serviced the machines at the honky-tonks where William's songs were most commonly played if a customer punched a \"Hank Williams\" selection on a jukebox and heard a sermon rather than the music expected. It was he who requested that Hank use a pseudonym for these recitations to avoid leading people astray.{{sfn|Hemphill, Paul|2005|pp=117-118}} Although the real identity of Luke the Drifter was supposed to be unknown, Williams often performed part of the recorded material on stage. Most of the material was written by Williams himself, although Fred Rose wrote at least one piece, and others, according to his son [[Wesley Rose|Wesley]], were collaborations between Williams, Rose, and himself.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|p=129}} The songs depicted Luke the Drifter traveling around from place to place, narrating stories of different characters{{sfn|Hurd, Mary G.|2015|p=12}} and philosophizing about relationships gone awry, injustice in society, and death.{{sfn|Wilmeth|2014|p=250}} Performances of the compositions included only Williams's voice, an organ, a [[Double bass|bass fiddle]], and Helms' steel guitar.{{sfn|Hemphill, Paul|2005|pp=118}}\n\nAround this time Williams released more hit songs, such as \"[[My Son Calls Another Man Daddy]]\", \"[[Why Should We Try Anymore]]\", \"[[Long Gone Lonesome Blues]]\", \"[[Why Don't You Love Me (Hank Williams song)|Why Don't You Love Me]]\", and \"[[I Just Don't Like This Kind of Living|I Just Don't Like This Kind of Livin']]\".{{sfn|Billboard staff|1951|p=19}} In 1951, \"[[Dear John (Hank Williams song)|Dear John]]\" became a hit, but it was the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]], \"[[Cold, Cold Heart]]\", that became one of his most recognized songs.{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|pp=155-159}} A pop cover version by [[Tony Bennett]] released the same year stayed on the charts for 27 weeks, peaking at number one.{{sfn|Whitburn, Joel|p=26|1991}}\n\n{{Listen |filename=Beyond The Sunset Hank Williams.ogg |title=Beyond the Sunset |description=One characteristic of Williams's recordings as \"Luke the Drifter\" is the use of narration rather than singing.}}\nWilliams's career reached a peak in the late summer of 1951 with his [[Hadacol]] tour of the U.S. with [[Bob Hope]] and other actors. On the weekend after the tour ended, Williams was photographed backstage at the Grand Ole Opry signing a motion picture deal with [[MGM]].{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|p=190}} In October, Williams recorded a demo, \"[[There's a Tear in My Beer]]\" for a friend, \"[[Big Bill Lister]]\", who had recorded \"Beer Drinking Blues\", a beer drinking song that sold well, and needed another one. The session was recorded by the head of [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] for [[Capitol Records]], [[Ken Nelson (American record producer)|Ken Nelson]]. Afterwards Lister stored the demo acetate, with no markings, in a box of records kept at his house, and then when he moved, in his yard under a tarp for several years.

She said that Bob Dylan was given the first opportunity to perform 12 songs for a CD compilation. Dylan approached Williams's granddaughter Holly Williams at a show where he gave her a sheaf of song lyrics he wanted her to read. She later said that although Dylan had said nothing about them at first, she recognized them immediately as her grandfather's work. He then said he had been asked to possibly cut an entire album, or that he might have other artists perform them. She heard nothing more about it for two years until Mary Martin revived the project and she got a phone call from her publishing company saying it was time for her to pick up some samples of the available material.{{sfn|Talbott, Chris|2011}}\n\nConsequently, several other musicians got involved in the project, their main task being to create music that suited the lyrics.

She wrote two more and added a bridge.

The suit demanded that both of the publishing companies continue to pay her half of the royalties from Hank Williams's records. Williams had an agreement giving his first wife half of the royalties, but allegedly there was no clarification that the deal was valid after his death. Because Williams left no will, the disposition of the remaining 50 percent was considered uncertain; those involved included Williams's second wife, [[Billie Jean Horton]] and Williams's mother and sister.{{sfn|Billboard staff|1953b|p=15}}\n\nAt the time of his death, Williams's estate was estimated to be US$13,329.25 ({{Inflation|US|13329.25|1953|fmt=eq|r=-2|cursign=$}}) between cash, a cashier's check and his possessions.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|p=233}} Lilly Williams considered the legality of Billie Jean's marriage to her son doubtful and she filed for the control of the estate.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|p=234}} Billie Jean's lawyer argued that although she married Williams ten days before the finalization of her divorce to Harrison Eshlimar, Louisiana law considered the union legal since she married \"in good faith\".{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|pp=234-235}}\n\nDoubtful of the legality of the marriage in Tennessee and Alabama, Lilly Williams and her lawyers made several offers to settle out of court with Billie Jean that reached a final of US$30,000.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|p=235}} On August 19, 1953, Billie Jean signed an agreement accepting the money. It required that she stopped making appearances billing herself as \"Mrs. Hank Williams\", to reveal the location of Williams's [[Tennessee Walking Horse]], and the return of a saddle and three suitcases that belonged to him. With the agreement, Lilly became the legal guardian of the estate on behalf of Hank Williams, Jr.{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|p=288}}\n\nSoon after giving birth, Bobbie Jett left her and Williams's daughter at Lilly's boardinghouse. Williams's mother expressed to the Montgomery County Department of Public Welfare in January 1953 her intention to adopt the child. While Irene Williams opposed the adoption, Williams's mother was granted the custody over the child she renamed \"Cathy\".{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|pp=285-286}} However, upon Lilly's death in 1955, Irene Williams assumed control of the estate.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|p=235}} She became thus the legal guardian of Williams's son, while refusing to adopt Cathy. Irene made an attempt to contact the girl's mother, Bobbie Jett, who was at the time married and lived in California. Jett refused to take the child since her husband did not know of the existence of her daughter with Williams.{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|p=289}} Cathy was then put up for adoption and granted money from the estate of Lilly Williams, to be paid at the age of 21.{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|p=290}}\n\nIn 1963, Wesley Rose contacted Irene regarding the copyright renewals with Acuff-Rose: Rose offered US$25,000 ({{Inflation|US|25000|1963|fmt=eq|r=-2|cursign=$}}),{{sfn|Koon, George William|2001|p=85}} which Irene accepted to prevent Williams's daughter from making a claim in the future.{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|p=293}} In 1966, an Alabama judge determined that the guardianship of Williams's estate belonged to Irene Williams, and he confirmed the validity of the copyright renewal deal. Cathy's adoptive parents were contacted by a lawyer, but they refused to contest the ruling of the court.{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|p=294}} In 1967, Hank Williams, Jr. was declared the only heir to the estate by a second judge.{{sfn|Koon, George William|2001|p=87}} In 1969, the guardianship of the estate was transferred to lawyer Robert Stewart after Irene was arrested and sentenced to a jail term for possession of cocaine by a Texas court.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|p=235}} Hank Williams, Jr. reached legal adulthood in 1970.{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|p=293}}\n\nOn October 22, 1975, a federal judge in [[Atlanta]], Georgia, ruled that Billie Jean Horton was Williams's common-law wife, and that part of the copyright renewals of the songs belonged to her.{{sfn|Koon, George William|2001|p=87}} At the age of 21, Cathy learned that Hank Williams was her biological father. In 1981, she found her half-siblings in California, and she learned of a 1951 contract between her biological parents that recognized her as Williams's daughter. She also learned that the court decisions of the 1960s ignored her existence. After a decision by the [[Supreme Court of Alabama]] in 1989, she was recognized as an heir of the estate of Williams. She later changed her name to Jett Williams.{{sfn|Koon, George William|2001|pp=89-90}}\n\n====WSM's ''Mother's Best Flour''====\nIn 1951, Williams hosted a 15-minute show for ''Mother's Best Flour'' on WSM radio. Due to Williams's tour schedules, some of the shows were previously recorded to be played in his absence.{{sfn|Hilbourn, Robert|2008}} During the mid-1960s, WSM staff photographer Les Leverett rescued acetates that were thrown away by the station.{{sfn|Underwood, Ryan|2006|p=2A}} At a later point, the recordings were duplicated.{{sfn|Ragogna, Mike|2010}} In the 1980s, he shared the acetates with Williams's former band member Jerry Rivers. A decade later, Leverett made a deal with former Drifting Cowboy Hillous Brutum, who did not appear on the recordings, for a commercial release of the copies.{{sfn|Underwood, Ryan|2006|p=2A}}\n\nThe Legacy Entertainment Group, based in [[Brentwood, Tennessee]], was sued by [[PolyGram]] and the heirs of Williams to block the release in 1997. While the original acetates of the shows made their way to the possession of Jett Williams, the lawyer of Legacy Entertainment Group claimed that they belonged to the label and he made an attempt to prevent the heirs of Williams to work on their own release of the recordings. Leverett then told ''[[The Tennessean]]'' that the original acetates did not belong to Butrum, and that the two of them made a deal to share the profits of the planned Legacy Entertainment Group release.{{sfn|Underwood, Ryan|2006|p=2A}} The [[Universal Music Group]], the parent company of Polygram, then claimed ownership of the shows.{{sfn|Ragogna, Mike|2010}}\n\nIn January 2006, the [[Tennessee Court of Appeals]] upheld a lower court ruling stating that Williams's heirs—son, [[Hank Williams Jr]], and daughter, [[Jett Williams]]—have the sole rights to sell his recordings.{{sfn|AP staff|2006}} In 2008, [[Time-Life]] released ''Unreleased Recordings'', a selection of numbers pertaining to the ''Mother's Best Flour'' shows. In 2010, the company released a 15-CD box-set containing all of the recordings remastered by sound engineer Joe Palmaccio entitled ''The Complete Mothers' Best Recordings... Plus!''.{{sfn|Hyperbolium|2010}}\n\n===Tributes===\n{{main|List of tributes to Hank Williams}}\n\n==Awards==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Year !! Award !!
