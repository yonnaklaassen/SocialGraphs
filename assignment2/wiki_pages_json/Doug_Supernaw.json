After several years performing as a local musician throughout the state of [[Texas]], he signed with [[BNA Records]] in 1993.\n\nSupernaw released four studio albums in his career: ''[[Red and Rio Grande]]'' (1993), ''[[Deep Thoughts from a Shallow Mind]]'' (1994), ''[[You Still Got Me (Doug Supernaw album)|You Still Got Me]]'' (1995), and ''Fadin' Renegade'' (1999). Between 1993 and 1996, he charted 11 singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now [[Hot Country Songs]]) charts, including \"[[I Don't Call Him Daddy]]\", his only No. 1 single, in late 1993.\n\n==Biography==\nDoug Supernaw was born on September 26, 1960, in [[Bryan, Texas]].<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p41819|pure_url=yes}} |title=Doug Supernaw biography |access-date=January 5, 2008 |last=Loftus |first=Johnny |work=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> He grew up in Inwood Forest and was an avid golfer as well as a member of his high school golf team.

After four years in Nashville, he moved back to Texas, where he founded a band called Texas Steel.<ref name=\"oldies\"/>\n\n===1993–1995: BNA Records===\nAn [[A&R]] executive for [[RCA Records]] discovered Supernaw and signed him to the label's BNA Entertainment (now [[BNA Records]]) division in 1993.<ref name=\"oldies\"/> That year, Supernaw released his debut album, ''[[Red and Rio Grande]]''. From the album, four singles were released, starting with \"Honky Tonkin' Fool\", which did not enter Top 40 on the ''Billboard'' country music charts. \"Reno\", the second single, reached Top 5 soon afterward, while its follow-up, \"[[I Don't Call Him Daddy]]\" (previously a No.&nbsp;86 single in 1988 for [[Kenny Rogers]]), became Supernaw's only Number One single by the end of the year.<ref name=\"oldies\"/> The album went on to achieve gold certification in the United States.<ref name=AP>{{cite news|title=Doug Supernaw, '90s country singer of 'Reno,' dead at 60|url=https://apnews.com/article/houston-nashville-texas-a286ac06afad4c1cd2462dbd9370f4c3|first=Kristin M.|last=Hall|date=November 13, 2020|access-date=November 14, 2020|work=Associated Press|archive-date=November 15, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201115124104/https://apnews.com/article/houston-nashville-texas-a286ac06afad4c1cd2462dbd9370f4c3|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nA series of injuries nearly ended Supernaw's career after his first album's release. After recovering from a broken neck suffered while [[surfing]], he was involved in a head-on car collision. Finally, he was hospitalized after a nearly-fatal case of [[food poisoning]].<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> Once he had recovered from the food poisoning, he recorded his second album for BNA, 1994's ''[[Deep Thoughts from a Shallow Mind]]''. Of the album's three singles, only the [[Dennis Linde]]-penned \"[[What'll You Do About Me]]\" (previously a single in 1984 for [[Steve Earle]], and in 1992 for [[the Forester Sisters]], and recorded by [[Randy Travis]] on his 1987 album ''[[Always & Forever (Randy Travis album)|Always & Forever]]'') entered Top 40 on the country music charts.
