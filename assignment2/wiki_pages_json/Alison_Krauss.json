Retrieved July 8, 2006.</ref>\n\n===Music videos===\nKrauss did not think she would make music videos at the beginning of her career. After recording her first she was convinced it was so bad that she would never do another. Nonetheless, she has continued to make further videos. Many of the first videos she saw were by bluegrass artists. [[Dan Tyminski]] has noted that the [[Michael Jackson's Thriller (music video)|video for ''Thriller'']] was very popular at the time she was first exposed to music videos. She has made suggestions on the style or theme to some videos, though she tends to leave such decisions to the [[music video director|director]] of the particular video. The group chooses directors by seeking out people who have previously directed videos that band members have enjoyed. The director for a video to \"If I Didn't Know Any Better\" from ''Lonely Runs Both Ways'', for example, was selected because Krauss enjoyed work he had done with [[Def Leppard]] and, she wondered, what he could do with their music. While style decisions are generally left to the various directors of the videos, many&nbsp;– including for \"[[The Lucky One (Alison Krauss song)|The Lucky One]]\", \"Restless\", \"Goodbye is All We Have\", \"New Favorite\", and \"If I Didn't Know Any Better\" – follow a pattern. In all of these videos Krauss walks, sometimes interacting with other people, while the rest of the band follows her.<ref name=\"gacvideo\" /><ref name=\"gacinterview\">[http://www.gactv.com/gac/shows_ngt/episode/0,,GAC_26155_44020,00.html Interview with Alison Krauss and Dan Tyminski] on ''GAC Nights''{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.
