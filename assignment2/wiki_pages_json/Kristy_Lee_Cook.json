Tour 2008.]]\nCook auditioned for ''American Idol'' in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], by singing \"[[Amazing Grace]]\". All three judges liked her voice and sent her straight through to [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]]. In Hollywood, her first song did not impress the judges. For her second and final chance, she sang \"Amazing Grace\" again; she was then selected as one of the top 24 contestants in the semi-finals. She was the first female performer of the season and sang \"Rescue Me\". The judges did not care for her performance but gave her props since she was the first of the night and she had [[bronchitis]]. On March 12, Cook was placed in the bottom three with [[Syesha Mercado]] and [[David Hernandez (singer)|David Hernandez]]. She was declared safe. On March 19, she was placed in the bottom three again with [[Carly Smithson]] and [[Amanda Overmyer]], but she survived again, ensuring herself a spot in the ''American Idol'' Top 10 Concert Tour for the coming summer. Once again, on April 2, she was placed in the bottom three with her two roommates, [[Ramiele Malubay]] and [[Brooke White]]. Malubay was eliminated.\n\n===Performances===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:left;\"\n|-  style=\"text-align:Center; background:#ccc;\"\n| colspan=\"100\"|'''Week #'''\n| colspan=\"100\"|'''Theme'''\n| colspan=\"100\"|'''Song choice'''\n| colspan=\"100\"|'''Original artist'''\n| colspan=\"100\"|'''Order #'''\n| colspan=\"100\"|'''Result'''\n|-\n| colspan=\"100\"  style=\"text-align:center;
