Following high school, while attending [[UCLA]], Benton took a job with ''[[Playboy]]'' to appear on their entertainment show ''[[Playboy After Dark]]'' at age 18. She began as an extra on the show, but after host [[Hugh Hefner]] fell in love with Benton, her role was quickly elevated to co-host. After recording two episodes, Hefner asked the young co-ed for a date. Upon being asked, she reportedly demurred to the then-42-year-old Hefner: \"I don't know, I've never dated anyone over 24 before.\" To which Hefner replied, \"That's all right, neither have I.\" The two began a relationship that lasted several years, and placed Benton in the center of the Playboy enterprise. Hefner persuaded her to change her name from Barbara Klein to the more \"marketable\" Barbi Benton. She is credited with persuading Hefner to buy the [[Playboy Mansion]] in [[Holmby Hills]] in 1974.\n\nBenton (initially credited as Barbi Klein) appeared on the cover of ''Playboy'' four times: July 1969, March 1970, May 1972, and December 1985. She had additional nude photo layouts in the December 1973 and January 1975 issues. Though she was featured in a number of photo-essays, she was never a [[Playmate of the Month]]. \n\nShe soon landed a spot on television's ''[[Hee Haw]]'' doing short comedy sketches and often appeared as a dancer in some of the episodes of Season 5 and 6 (1971 to 1973) of [[Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In]]. Benton left ''Hee Haw'' after four seasons to concentrate on a more Hollywood-oriented career. She became a featured repeat performer on a number of popular 1970s American television series, including ''[[The Bobby Vinton Show]]'', ''[[The Love Boat]]'' and ''[[Fantasy Island]]''. \nBenton later starred in the short-lived 1977 [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC-TV]] comedy series ''[[Sugar Time!]]'' about an aspiring female rock group. She was also in several films during her career. She  appeared in the 1970 West German comedy film ''[[How Did a Nice Girl Like You Get Into This Business?|The Naughty Cheerleader]]'' and in the [[slasher film]]  ''[[Hospital Massacre]]'' in 1982.\n\nBenton lived with Hefner from 1969 until 1976 and is known for discovering the Playboy Mansion West, where Hefner resided until his death in 2017.<ref>{{cite journal| last1=Hinant| first1=Cindy| title=Grids Next Door| journal=Gnome| date=Winter 2012| volume=1| issue=1| pages=48–53| url=http://gnomemag.com/grids-next-door/| quote=The California Mansion, or Playboy Mansion West, is a Tudor Gothic mansion in Los Angeles found by then girlfriend, Barbi Benton.}}</ref> Years later, when the television series ''[[The Girls Next Door]]'' visited her in [[Aspen, Colorado]], she expressed gratitude that the two had remained friends.\n\n=== Recording career ===\nBenton achieved some success as a recording artist, hitting the country charts in the mid 1970s. After beginning her career on [[Playboy Records]] in 1974, her record \"Brass Buckles\" (1975) was a top-five hit on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard's]]'' country singles chart.  Follow-up singles charted modestly through 1976.  Her third album, ''Something New'', was oriented more towards the pop market, and featured her only single that made the pop charts, \"Staying Power\" (which \"bubbled under\" at #108).  \n\nHer final country album ''Ain't That Just the Way'' (1978) was released only in Scandinavia; the title track was a number one hit in Sweden for five weeks.  The same song was also a major hit for [[Lutricia McNeal]] in 1996, and was recorded by the Dutch singer [[Patricia Paay]] under the title ''Poor Jeremy'' in 1977.\n\nBenton's final album, 1988's ''Kinetic Voyage'' was very different from her earlier work.  This was a largely instrumental new age album for which Benton composed or co-composed all the songs, played [[piano]] and synths, and produced and arranged the work in collaboration with [[Jamil Szmadzinski]].\n\n== Personal life ==\nBenton dated ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine founder Hugh Hefner from 1969 to 1976.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |last=Nahas |first=Aili |date=October 2, 2017 |title=Hugh Hefner's Longtime Love Barbi Benton on the Last Time She Saw Him: He Thought He Had 'Plenty of Time Left' |url=https://people.com/tv/hugh-hefner-longtime-love-barbi-benton-exclusive-interview/ |access-date=2024-07-03 |website=Peoplemag |language=en}}</ref> Hefner asked Benton to marry him four times, but he was unfaithful during their relationship.<ref name=\":0\" /> When Benton pursued a singing career, their relationship deteriorated further as she spent more time on the road touring.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nShe married real estate developer George Gradow on October 14, 1979.<ref name=\"BentonSacraised-Peoplemag\" /> They have two children, Alexander and Ariana.
