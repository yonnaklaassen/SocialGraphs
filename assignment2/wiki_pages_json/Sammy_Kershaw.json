He has released 16 studio albums, with three RIAA platinum certifications and two gold certifications among them. More than 25 singles have entered the Top 40 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts, including his only number one hit \"[[She Don't Know She's Beautiful]]\" and 10 more Top 10 hits: \"[[Cadillac Style]]\", \"[[Anywhere but Here (song)|Anywhere but Here]]\", \"[[Haunted Heart (Sammy Kershaw song)|Haunted Heart]]\", \"[[Queen of My Double-Wide Trailer]]\", \"[[I Can't Reach Her Anymore]]\", \"[[National Working Woman's Holiday]]\", \"[[Third Rate Romance]]\", \"[[Meant to Be (Sammy Kershaw song)|Meant to Be]]\", \"[[Vidalia (song)|Vidalia]]\", and \"[[Love of My Life (Sammy Kershaw song)|Love of My Life]]\".\n\nKershaw tried to enter politics, running as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate for [[lieutenant governor of Louisiana]] in 2007 and 2010. In 2007 he finished third in the jungle primary, but Democrat [[Mitch Landrieu]] won strongly in the general election. In 2010 he carried more parishes than any other candidate, but placed third. He endorsed Republican [[Jay Dardenne]], Secretary of State, for the position, who won the general election.\n\n==Early life and career==\nSamuel Paul Cashat was born in the [[Acadiana]] town of [[Kaplan, Louisiana|Kaplan]], located in South Louisiana. He is the third cousin of singers [[Rusty and Doug|Rusty]] and [[Doug Kershaw]].<ref name=\"allmusic\" /> When he was 11, his grandfather gave him his first [[guitar]]. But his father died that year, so Sammy started to work a variety of day jobs while playing [[Roadhouse (facility)|roadhouse]]s at night to support his family. He began performing in Acadiana with Louisiana legend J.B. Pere. At the age of 12, Kershaw was playing in a variety of honky-tonks and beer joints, and when he was 14 he met [[George Jones]], his lifelong idol.<ref name=\"villages-news.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.villages-news.com/sammy-kershaw-tells-tales-battling-booze-bankruptcy-lorrie-morgan |title=Sammy Kershaw tells tales of battling booze, bankruptcy and Lorrie Morgan |website=Villages-News.com|date=28 June 2016 |access-date=2016-08-25}}</ref> Subsequently, he opened shows for [[Ray Price (musician)|Ray Price]], [[Merle Haggard]], and [[George Jones]] while still barely into his teens. When the pressures of growing up fast took their toll in the form of a serious [[drug abuse|drug]] and [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] problem, he quit his bad habits in 1988. He took a break from the music world to work as a remodeling supervisor at [[Wal-Mart]].\n\n==Musical career==\nOne of Kershaw's demonstration tapes made its way to [[Mercury Records]], which released his debut album ''[[Don't Go Near the Water (album)|Don't Go Near the Water]]'' in 1991. This album was certified [[platinum album|platinum]] by the [[RIAA]], and it produced four hit singles. The lead-off, \"[[Cadillac Style]]\", went to No.&nbsp;3 in late 1991 and early 1992, followed by the [[Don't Go Near the Water (Sammy Kershaw song)|title track]] at No.&nbsp;12, \"[[Yard Sale (song)|Yard Sale]]\" at No.&nbsp;17, and \"[[Anywhere but Here (song)|Anywhere but Here]]\" at No.&nbsp;10. Kershaw was initially reluctant to release \"Cadillac Style\" because he felt that it was not suitable for his style; however, his co-producer, [[Buddy Cannon]], convinced him to give the song a chance. Kershaw's often [[honky-tonk]] material and singing voice led to critical comparisons to [[George Jones]], and he covered one of Jones's early singles, \"What Am I Worth\", on his debut as well.\n\nIn 1993, Kershaw received an initial nomination for the [[Academy of Country Music Award for New Male Artist of the Year|Academy of Country Music Award for New Male Vocalist of the Year]]. He was nominated alongside [[Billy Ray Cyrus]], [[Tracy Lawrence]], [[Chris LeDoux]] and [[Collin Raye]]; Cyrus, Lawrence and Raye would make the final three.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.worldradiohistory.com/Archive-All-Music/Cash-Box/90s/1993/CB-1993-02-13.pdf|title=ACM Announces Nominations|magazine=[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]]|pages=21|date=February 13, 1993}}</ref>\n\nKershaw's second album, ''[[Haunted Heart (Sammy Kershaw album)|Haunted Heart]]'', followed in 1993. Its lead-off single, \"[[She Don't Know She's Beautiful]]\", became his only Number One hit, in April of that year. Following it were the [[Haunted Heart (Sammy Kershaw song)|title track]], the [[Dennis Linde]]–penned \"[[Queen of My Double-Wide Trailer]]\", and \"[[I Can't Reach Her Anymore]]\", all of which hit the Top 10 as well. Although Kershaw had been told by others that radio audiences might not identify with the subject matter on \"Queen of My Double-Wide Trailer\", Kershaw wanted to release the song because he had an experience similar to its story line. Like his debut, ''Haunted Heart'' was a platinum album.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> In mid-1994, Kershaw also covered the [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]] song \"[[I Know a Little]]\" on the tribute album ''[[Skynyrd Frynds]]'', which included country music covers of Skynyrd songs. Also in 1994, Kershaw contributed the song \"[[Fire and Rain (song)|Fire and Rain]]\" to the [[AIDS]] benefit album ''[[Red Hot + Country]]'', produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]].\n\n''[[Feelin' Good Train]]'' was Kershaw's third album, released later in 1994. This album also produced four hits, including two consecutive No.&nbsp;2's in \"[[National Working Woman's Holiday]]\" and \"[[Third Rate Romance]]\" (the latter a cover of the [[Amazing Rhythm Aces]] hit from 1975),<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> with the No.&nbsp;27 \"[[Southbound (Mac McAnally song)|Southbound]]\" and No.&nbsp;18 \"[[If You're Gonna Walk, I'm Gonna Crawl]]\" following in 1995. The album included a duet with George Jones on \"Never Bit a Bullet Like This\", which had previously been released on Jones's 1993 album ''[[High-Tech Redneck]]''. ''Feelin' Good Train'' was certified gold. It was followed by a Christmas album, ''[[Christmas Time's A-Comin' (album)|Christmas Time's A-Comin']]'', and Kershaw's first greatest-hits package, ''Greatest Hits, Volume 1'', both in 1995. The latter produced a No.&nbsp;47 single in \"Your Tattoo\" (written by [[Kostas Lazarides|Kostas]] and [[Jack Tempchin]]), the first single of Kershaw's career not to reach the Top 40.\n\n===Mid-late 1990s===\nKershaw's fourth studio album, the gold-certified ''[[Politics, Religion and Her]]'', was issued in 1996. It produced Top 10 hits in \"[[Meant to Be (Sammy Kershaw song)|Meant to Be]]\" and \"[[Vidalia (song)|Vidalia]]\", the latter of which Kershaw also considered a risky song, saying, \"If radio will play this one more than twice—so people can get the story and learn what a [[Vidalia onion]] is—it'll be a smash.\" These songs were followed by \"[[Fit to Be Tied Down (Sammy Kershaw song)|Fit to Be Tied Down]]\" and the [[Politics, Religion and Her (song)|title track]], both of which hit the Top 30. Also included on ''Politics, Religion and Her'' were covers of [[Chuck Berry]]'s \"[[Memphis, Tennessee (song)|Memphis, Tennessee]]\" and [[Sammy Johns]]' \"[[Chevy Van (song)|Chevy Van]]\". The same year, Kershaw briefly took ownership of a [[NASCAR]] Busch series team (now Xfinity Series).\n\n''[[Labor of Love (Sammy Kershaw album)|Labor of Love]]'' was issued later in 1997 as his fifth album. Unlike his previous albums, this one was predominantly composed of ballads.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> It produced a No.&nbsp;2 (and final US Top 10 hit) in \"[[Love of My Life (Sammy Kershaw song)|Love of My Life]]\", and although none of the other three singles (\"[[Matches (Sammy Kershaw song)|Matches]]\", \"[[Honky Tonk America]]\" and \"[[One Day Left to Live]]\") reached higher than No.&nbsp;22, the album was nonetheless certified platinum. His next album, ''[[Maybe Not Tonight]]'', brought a Top 20 duet with [[Lorrie Morgan]].<ref name=\"allmusic\"/>\n\nKershaw stated that he enjoyed working with Morgan on the song, telling ''[[Country Weekly]]'' magazine, \"I knew our vocals would match up… Plus, we have fun together. We're friends and we have been friends for a long time.\" \"[[Maybe Not Tonight (song)|Maybe Not Tonight]]\" was commercially less successful than its predecessors, however, and it became the first album of Kershaw's career not to achieve an RIAA certification. Following \"Maybe Not Tonight\" were the singles \"[[When You Love Someone (Sammy Kershaw song)|When You Love Someone]]\" and \"[[Me and Maxine]]\", both of which peaked in the thirties. \"[[Louisiana Hot Sauce]]\", the final release from ''[[Maybe Not Tonight]]'', was also the first single of his career not to enter the charts.\n\nIn 2000, Kershaw released an album of [[cover song]]s, ''[[Covers the Hits]]''. This album comprised 10 cover songs that Kershaw had recorded in his career. Some of the songs on it, such as the single \"Third Rate Romance\", were previously found on Kershaw's studio albums, while others came from various tribute albums (such as ''Skynyrd Frynds'') to which he had contributed. ''Covers the Hits'' also included a rendition of [[Dr. Hook]]'s \"Little Bit More\", a previously unreleased cover which Kershaw had recorded during the sessions for ''Labor of Love''.\n\n===2000s===\nBy 2001, Kershaw and Morgan had married. The two recorded a vocal duet album in 2001 entitled ''[[I Finally Found Someone (Lorrie Morgan and Sammy Kershaw album)|I Finally Found Someone]]'' (the [[I Finally Found Someone|title track]] being a cover of the [[Barbra Streisand]]/[[Bryan Adams]] duet). This album was less successful commercially, with its only Top 40 hit being the No. 39 \"He Drinks Tequila\". Shortly afterward, a second 'greatest hits' package was released, and Kershaw left Mercury's roster.\n\nIn 2003, Kershaw signed to [[Audium Entertainment]] to release the album ''[[I Want My Money Back]]''.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> This album produced a No. 33-peaking in its [[I Want My Money Back (song)|title track]], but the second single \"I've Never Been Anywhere\" fell short of the Top 40. The third and final single, \"Beer, Bait & Ammo\" (which failed to chart), was previously recorded and written by [[Kevin Fowler]] on his 2000 debut album [[Beer, Bait & Ammo|of the same name]], and would later be recorded by [[Mark Chesnutt]] on his 2004 album ''[[Savin' the Honky Tonk]]''.\n\nAfter Audium closed its Nashville division, Kershaw signed to [[Category 5 Records]], then a newly established independent label, in 2006. His first release for the label and first chart single in three years, \"Tennessee Girl\", fell three spaces short of the Top 40 that year. It was the first release from his 2006 album ''[[Honky Tonk Boots]]''. The album's only other single, a cover of [[Mel McDaniel]]'s Number One hit \"[[Baby's Got Her Blue Jeans On]]\", failed to chart, and financial difficulties caused the label to close in 2007.\n\nIn 2008, Sammy Kershaw was inducted into The [[Louisiana Music Hall of Fame]] in honor of his career achievements and was also inducted into the Louisiana Songwriters Association Hall Of Fame in 2010.\n\nKershaw's first single in two years, \"[[Real People (song)|Real People]]\", was released in late 2008 in the Boomerville/Big Hit label. However, the single failed to chart. His tenth studio album, ''[[Better Than I Used to Be]]'', was released on August 31, 2010.\n\n===Political activity===\nKershaw had become increasingly interested in politics. On June 13, 2007, he announced his candidacy for [[lieutenant governor]] of Louisiana in the October 20 [[jungle primary]]. The position was held by the incumbent [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], [[Mitch Landrieu]]. Kershaw also faced a second Republican candidate, [[Louisiana State Legislature|State Representative]] Gary Beard of [[Baton Rouge]], an [[engineer]] first elected to the State House in a 2001 [[special election]]. Kershaw finished second with 30 percent of the vote, but Landrieu won re-election with a majority on the first ballot.\n\nWatching his state embroiled in the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill|Gulf Oil Spill]] in April 2010, Kershaw, a Lafayette resident, became the official spokesperson for Protect Our Coastline, a non-profit dedicated to providing relief to the fishermen and shrimpers affected most by the spill.\n\nOn August 28, 2010, Kershaw announced his second bid for lieutenant governor in the October 2 [[special election]] to replace Mitch Landrieu, who left office in May after being elected [[mayor]] of [[New Orleans]]. Kershaw's intraparty rivals included  state Republican chair Roger F. Villere Jr. of [[Metairie, Louisiana|Metairie]], [[St. Tammany Parish]] president Kevin Davis of [[Slidell, Louisiana|Slidell]], and Secretary of State [[Jay Dardenne]] of Baton Rouge. Kershaw polled 19 percent and carried 31 of the 64 parishes (more than any other candidate).<ref>{{cite news\n|url = http://www.bayoubuzz.com/buzz/latest-buzz/item/520-louisiana-lt-governors-race-dardenne-vs-fayard-is-gender-party-region-showdown\n|newspaper = BayouBuzz News\n|first = Christopher \n|last = Tidmore \n|title = Louisiana Lt.
