They are also the three daughters of Barny and Carter Roberston, both of whom played in [[Waylon Jennings]]' road band The Waylors in the 1970s; Emily Fortney is also married to Marc \"Butter\" Fortney of [[Trailer Choir]], another country music group.\n\nAfter several years of performing locally, the trio was signed in 2006 to Show Dog Nashville (now [[Show Dog-Universal Music]]), a record label owned by country singer [[Toby Keith]]. Their debut single, \"Young Love\", reached the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts, as did its followup \"Different Breed.\" Both are included on the group's debut album, which was issued to digital retailers in June 2008.\n\n==Biography==\nBecky, Emily, and Joanna Robertson were raised in a musically inclined household in southern California.<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p1010236/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Carter's Chord biography |access-date=2008-02-20 |last=Leahey |first=Andrew |work=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> Their parents—keyboardist and producer Barny Robertson, and vocalist Carter Robertson—were both members of [[Waylon Jennings]]' road band The Waylors in the 1970s.<ref name=\"bmi\">{{cite web |url=http://www.bmi.com/news/entry/534761 |title=Carter's Chord Joins BMI |access-date=2008-02-20 |date=April 4, 2007 |work=[[Broadcast Music Incorporated]]}}</ref><ref name=\"cst1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.countrystandardtime.com/news/newsitem.asp?xid=1168&t=Holidys_introduces_Carters_Chord_trio |title=Holidays introduces Carter's Chord trio |access-date=2008-02-20 |date=November 30, 2007 |work=Country Standard Time}}</ref><ref name=\"cst2\">{{cite web |url=http://www.countrystandardtime.com/news/newsitem.asp?xid=1293&t=Carters_Chord_goes_for_adds_on_Young_Love |title=Carter's Chord goes for adds on \"Young Love\" |access-date=2008-02-20 |date=January 14, 2008 |work=Country Standard Time}}</ref> Having performed together at their home from an early age, the three sisters made their recording debut on Jennings' 1998 album ''[[Cowboys, Sisters, Rascals & Dirt]]'', which their father produced.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> The sisters would also charge for the shows that they performed at home; among the artists who paid to see them at their house included Jennings and members of [[The Crickets]].<ref name=\"allmusic\"/>\n\nLater on, the three sisters moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], where they began honing their singing and songwriting skills.
