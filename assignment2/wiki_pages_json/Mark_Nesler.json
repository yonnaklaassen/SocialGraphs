Signed to [[Elektra Records]] as a recording artist in 1998, Nesler charted three singles on the U.S. ''Billboard'' country charts. In addition, he has written several singles for other country music artists, including [[Tim McGraw]]'s \"[[Just to See You Smile]]\", a song which ''Billboard'' ranked as the number one country single of 1998.\n\n==Biography==\nNesler played guitar at an early age. Inspired by the [[bluegrass music]] his father listened to, he soon learned to play [[banjo]] as well. After graduating high school, he played in a band called the Two Dollar Pistols.<ref name=\"allmusic\">[{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p294574/biography|pure_url=yes}} allmusic ((( Mark Nesler > Biography )))]</ref> In 1994, he was signed to a songwriting deal with [[Music Corporation of America|MCA Publishing]], and soon joined [[Tracy Byrd]]'s touring band.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> Byrd also recorded and released \"[[Heaven in My Woman's Eyes]]\", which Nesler wrote, as a single in 1996.\n\nIn 1998, Nesler scored his first number one as a songwriter, when [[Tim McGraw]] spent six weeks at Number One on the ''Billboard'' country music charts with \"[[Just to See You Smile]]\".<ref>[http://countrymusic.about.com/library/bltimmcgrawdisco.htm Tim McGraw Discography at About.com]</ref> The same year, Nesler's first album was released on [[Asylum Records]]. Its leadoff single, \"Used to the Pain\", peaked at No.&nbsp;47 on the country charts. The album also produced his highest-charting single in \"Slow Down\" at No.&nbsp;46, followed by \"Baby Ain't Rockin' Me Right\" at No.&nbsp;62. He also co-wrote [[Aaron Tippin]]'s late-1998 single \"[[For You I Will (Aaron Tippin song)|For You I Will]]\".\n\nAlthough he exited Elektra in 1999, Nesler continued to write for Byrd, who released \"Take Me with You When You Go\" and \"[[Just Let Me Be in Love]]\" in 2000 and 2002 respectively. [[George Strait]] recorded two of his songs: \"[[Go On (George Strait song)|Go On]]\"; and \"[[Living and Living Well]]\" which was a No.&nbsp;1 single. In 2005, [[Tracy Lawrence]] reached No.&nbsp;35 on the country charts with a cover of \"Used to the Pain\". Nesler co-wrote [[Bucky Covington]]'s 2007 debut single \"[[A Different World (song)|A Different World]]\", while Nesler's other credits included \"[[Why, Why, Why]]\" and “Let Me Down Easy” by [[Billy Currington]] and another number one with [[Keith Urban]]'s 2008 single \"[[You Look Good in My Shirt]]\", along with Josh Turner’s “Time Is Love”, Billboard’s 2012 most played song of the year.\n\nNesler is an ex-husband of singer-songwriter [[Jennifer Hanson]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://songtown.com/on-songwriting/5-days-built-songwriting-career/ | title=5 Days Built a Songwriting Career - Songtown | date=March 23, 2017 }}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n===Albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:12em;\"| Title\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:18em;\"| Album details\n! colspan=\"1\"| Peak positions\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n! width=\"60\"| [[Top Country Albums|US Country]]<br><ref name=\"Country Albums\">{{cite magazine|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=mark nesler|chart=Country Albums C}}|title=Mark Nesler Album & Song Chart History – Country Albums|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|accessdate=December 11, 2010}}</ref>\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''I'm Just That Way''\n| \n* Release date: June 23, 1998\n* Label: [[Asylum Records]]\n| 70\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Up All Night''\n| \n* Release date: October 14, 2003\n* Label: Compendia\n| —\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"font-size:8pt\"| \"—\" denotes releases that did not chart\n|-\n|}\n\n===Singles===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Year\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:16em;\"| Single\n! colspan=\"2\"| Peak chart<br />positions\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Album\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n! width=\"45\"| [[Hot Country Songs|US Country]]<br><ref name=\"Country Songs\">{{cite magazine|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=mark nesler|chart=Country Songs}}|title=Mark Nesler Album & Song Chart History – Country Songs|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|accessdate=December 11, 2010}}</ref>\n! width=\"45\"| [[RPM (magazine)|CAN Country]]<br><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-110.01-e.php?PHPSESSID=mfstfhcbgmru3ti1dqs7m84283&q1=mark+nesler&q2=Country+Singles&interval=20|title=Results – RPM – Library and Archives Canada – Country Singles|work=[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]|accessdate=December 11, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929100921/http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-110.01-e.php?PHPSESSID=mfstfhcbgmru3ti1dqs7m84283&q1=mark+nesler&q2=Country+Singles&interval=20|archive-date=September 29, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 1998\n! scope=\"row\"| \"[[Used to the Pain]]\"\n| 47\n| 43\n| align=\"left\" rowspan=\"3\"| ''I'm Just That Way''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Slow Down\"\n| 46\n| 45\n|-\n| 1999\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Baby Ain't Rockin' Me Right\"\n| 62\n| —\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" style=\"font-size:8pt\"| \"—\" denotes releases that did not chart\n|-\n|}\n\n===Music videos===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n!
