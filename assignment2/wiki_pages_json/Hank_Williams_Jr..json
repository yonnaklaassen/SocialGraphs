His musical style has been described as a blend of [[rock music|rock]], [[blues]], and [[country music|country]]. He is the son of country musician [[Hank Williams]] and the father of musicians [[Holly Williams (musician)|Holly Williams]] and [[Hank Williams III]], and the grandfather of [[Coleman Williams]]. He is also the half brother of [[Jett Williams]].\n\nWilliams began his career following in his famed father's footsteps, covering his father's songs and imitating his father's style. Williams' first television appearance was in a December 1963 episode of ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', in which at age fourteen he sang several songs associated with his father. Later that year, he was a guest star on ''[[Shindig!]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0929947/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t130|title=Hank Williams, Jr.|publisher=[[IMDb]]|access-date=August 8, 2018}}</ref>\n\nAs Williams struggled to define his own voice and place within the [[country music]] genre, his style began slowly to evolve.

Williams first stepped onto the stage and sang his father's songs when he was eight years old.\n\nHe attended [[John Overton High School]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], where he would bring his guitar to music class and play for pep rallies and performances with the choir.\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1964, Williams made his recording debut with \"[[Long Gone Lonesome Blues]]\", one of his father's many classic songs.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Billboard Book Of Top 40 Country Hits: 1944–2006, Second edition |last=Whitburn |first=Joel |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=388 |language=en |isbn=0823082911 }}</ref>\n\nHe provided the singing voice of his father<ref name=\"pc9\">{{Pop Chronicles |9 |4|Hank Williams Jr.}}</ref> in the 1964 film ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]].''<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058765/ |title=Your Cheatin' Heart |date=December 1, 1964 |website=IMDb.com}}</ref> He also recorded an album of duets with recordings of his father.<ref name=\"pc9\" />\n\n===A change in appearance and musical direction===\nAlthough Williams' recordings earned him numerous country hits throughout the 1960s and early 1970s with his role as a \"Hank Williams impersonator\", he became disillusioned and severed ties with his mother.\n\nBy the mid-1970s Williams began to pursue a musical direction that would eventually make him a superstar. While recording a series of moderately successful songs, Williams began a pattern of heavy drug and alcohol abuse. Upon moving to [[Alabama]], in an attempt to refocus both his creative energy and his troubled personal life, Williams began playing music with [[Southern rock]] musicians including [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Toy Caldwell]], and [[Charlie Daniels]]. ''[[Hank Williams Jr. and Friends]]'' (1975), often considered his watershed album, was the product of these then-groundbreaking collaborations.\n\nOn August 8, 1975, Williams was nearly killed while mountain climbing in southwestern [[Montana]]. While climbing [[List of mountains in Beaverhead County, Montana|Ajax Peak]] on the [[Continental Divide of the Americas|continental divide]] ([[Idaho]] border) west of [[Jackson, Montana|Jackson]], the snow beneath Williams collapsed and he fell almost {{convert|500|ft}} onto rock, causing multiple severe skull and facial fractures.<ref name=singfll>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8R9OAAAAIBAJ&pg=1923%2C4536621 |work=Spokesman-Review |location=(Spokane, Washington) |agency=Associated Press |title=Singer injured in fall |date=August 11, 1975 |page=1}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2006-01-11-williams-miner-visit_x.htm?POE=LIFISVA | work=USA Today | title=Hank Williams visits W.Va. mine survivor | date=January 11, 2006}}</ref> Williams spent two years recovering, re-learning how to talk and sing, and undergoing 17 surgeries to repair his skull and reconstruct his face.

To hide his scars and disfigurement from the accident, Williams grew a beard and began wearing sunglasses and a [[cowboy hat]]. The beard, hat, and sunglasses have since become Williams' [[trademark look|signature look]].{{citation needed|date=December 2022}}\n\nIn 1977, Williams recorded and released ''One Night Stands'' and ''The New South'', and worked closely with his old friend Waylon Jennings on the song \"Once and For All\".{{citation needed|date=December 2022}} In 1980, he appeared on the [[PBS]] show ''[[Austin City Limits]]'' during Season 5, along with the Shake Russell-[[Dana Cooper]] Band.{{citation needed|date=December 2022}}\n\n===Country music career===\n{{BLP sources section|date=October 2008}}\n[[File:HankWilliamsJrCollage-1000.jpg|thumb|upright=1.45|Williams performing at the Chumash Casino Resort in Santa Ynez, California, 2006]]\n\nIn 1976, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' wrote that Williams' \"mainstream country material has always been among [[Nashville Tennessee|Nashville]]{{'}}s best\".<ref>{{Cite web| title = Hank Williams Jr.: Hank William Jr. and Friends.

''[[Family Tradition (album)|Family Tradition]]'', ''[[Whiskey Bent and Hell Bound (album)|Whiskey Bent and Hell Bound]]'', ''[[Habits Old and New]]'', ''[[Rowdy (Hank Williams, Jr. album)|Rowdy]]'', ''[[The Pressure Is On]]'', ''[[High Notes]]'', ''[[Strong Stuff]]'', ''[[Man of Steel (album)|Man of Steel]]'', ''[[Major Moves (album)|Major Moves]]'', ''[[Five-O (album)|Five-O]]'', ''[[Montana Cafe]]'', and many others resulted in a long string of hits.\n\nBetween 1979 and 1992, Williams released 21 albums—18 studio albums and three compilations—that were all certified at least [[Music recording certification|gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]. Between 1979 and 1990, he enjoyed a string of 30 Top Ten singles on the Billboard Country charts, including eight No.&nbsp;1 singles, for a total of 44 Top Ten singles, including a total of 10 No.&nbsp;1 singles, during his career.\n\nIn 1982, he had nine albums simultaneously on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart, all of which were original works and not compilations. In 1987–88, Williams was named Entertainer of the Year by the [[Country Music Association]]. In 1987, 1988, and 1989, he won the same award from the [[Academy of Country Music]]. The pinnacle album of his acceptance and popularity was ''[[Born to Boogie (album)|Born to Boogie]]''.\n\nDuring the 1980s, Williams Jr. became a country music superstar known for catchy anthems and hard-edged, rock-influenced country. During the late 1970s and into the mid-1980s, Williams' songs constantly flew into the number one or number two spots, with songs such as \"Family Tradition\", \"Whiskey Bent and Hell Bound\", \"Old Habits\", \"Ain't Misbehavin{{'\"}}, \"[[Born to Boogie (song)|Born to Boogie]]\", and \"My Name Is Bocephus\".\n\nThe hit single \"[[Wild Streak]]\" (1987) was co-written by [[Houston]] native [[Terri Sharp]], for which Williams and Sharp both earned gold records. In 1988, he released a Southern pride song, \"[[If the South Woulda Won]]\". The reference is to a notional Southern victory in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].\n\nHis 1989 hit \"[[There's a Tear in My Beer]]\" was a duet with his father created using electronic merging technology. The song was written by his father, and had been previously recorded with Hank Williams playing the guitar as the sole instrument. The music video for the song combined existing television footage of Hank Williams performing, onto which electronic merging technology impressed the recordings of Williams, which then made it appear as if he were actually playing with his father. The video was both a critical and commercial success. It was named ''Video of the Year'' by both the Country Music Association and the Academy of Country Music. Williams would go on to win a [[Grammy Award]] in 1990 for [[Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals|Best Country Vocal Collaboration]].\n\nHe is well known for his hit \"[[A Country Boy Can Survive]]\" and as the performer of the theme song for ''[[Monday Night Football]]'', based on his 1984 hit \"[[All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight]]\". In 1991, 1992, 1993, and 1994, Williams' opening themes for ''Monday Night Football'' earned him four [[Emmy Award]]s. \n[[File:Hank Williams, Jr. (2006).jpg|thumb|Williams in 2006]]\nIn 2000, he provided the voice of Injun Joe in ''[[Tom Sawyer (2000 film)|Tom Sawyer]]''. In 2001, Williams Jr. co-wrote his classic hit \"A Country Boy Can Survive\" after 9/11, renaming it \"America Can Survive\". In 2004, Williams was featured prominently on ''CMT Outlaws''. In 2006, he starred at the Summerfest concert.\n\nHe has also made a cameo appearance along with [[Larry the Cable Guy]], [[Kid Rock]], and [[Charlie Daniels]] in [[Gretchen Wilson]]'s music video for the song \"[[All Jacked Up (song)|All Jacked Up]]\". He and Kid Rock also appeared in Wilson's \"[[Redneck Woman]]\" video. Hank also had a small part of Kid Rock's video \"Only God Knows Why\", and \"Redneck Paradise\".\n\nIn April 2009, Williams released a new single, \"Red, White & Pink-Slip Blues\", which peaked at number 43 on the country charts. The song was the lead-off single to Williams' album ''[[127 Rose Avenue]]''. The album debuted and peaked at number 7 on the ''Billboard'' Top Country Albums chart. Also in July 2009, ''127 Rose Avenue'' was announced as his last album for Curb Records.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1616664/hank-williams-jr-says-new-album-is-his-last-for-curb-records.jhtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090725202808/http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1616664/hank-williams-jr-says-new-album-is-his-last-for-curb-records.jhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 25, 2009|title=Hank Williams Jr. says new album is his last for Curb Records|last=Morris|first=Edward|work=[[Country Music Television]]|date=July 21, 2009|access-date=July 24, 2009}}</ref>\n\n== Musical style ==\nAs a multi-instrumentalist, Williams' repertoire of skills includes guitar, bass guitar, [[upright bass]], [[steel guitar]], [[banjo]], [[Resonator guitar]], piano, keyboards, saxophone, [[harmonica]], [[fiddle]], and drums.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> Williams began his recording career performing covers of his father's songs.

When asked why the golf game troubled him, Williams stated, \"Come on. That'd be like Hitler playing golf with [[Benjamin Netanyahu|Netanyahu]]&nbsp;... in the shape this country is in?\" He also said that the President and Vice President were \"the enemy\" and compared them to \"the [[Three Stooges]]\". Later, anchor [[Gretchen Carlson]] said to him, \"You used the name of one of the most hated people in all of the world to describe, ''I think'', the president.\" Williams replied, \"Well, that is true. But I'm telling you like it is.\" As a result of his statements, [[ESPN]] dropped Williams' opening song from its ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' broadcast of the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] versus the [[Indianapolis Colts]] and replaced it with the [[The Star-Spangled Banner|national anthem]].{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}\n\nWilliams later said his analogy was \"extreme – but it was to make a point\", and \"some of us have strong opinions and are often misunderstood&nbsp;... I was simply trying to explain how stupid it seemed to me – how ludicrous that pairing was. They're polar opposites, and it made no sense. They don't see eye to eye and never will\". Additionally, Williams said he has \"always respected the office of the president ... Working-class people are hurting – and it doesn't seem like anybody cares. When both sides are high-fiving it on the ninth hole when everybody else is without a job – it makes a whole lot of us angry. Something has to change. The policies have to change\". ESPN later said it was \"extremely disappointed\" in Williams' comments, and pulled his opening from that night's broadcast.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2011/football/nfl/10/03/espn.williams.ap/index.html |title=ESPN pulls Hank Williams Jr. intro after singer links Obama with Hitler |publisher=Sportsillustrated.cnn.com |date=October 3, 2011 |access-date=November 27, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111113134647/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2011/football/nfl/10/03/espn.williams.ap/index.html |archive-date=November 13, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThree days later, ESPN announced Williams and his song would not return to ''Monday Night Football'', ending the use of the song that had been part of the broadcast on both ABC and ESPN since 1989.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/7066449/espn-hank-williams-jr-theme-song-return-monday-night-football|title=ESPN, Hank Williams Jr. part ways|date=October 6, 2010|work=ESPN.com}}</ref> Williams expressed defiance and indifference on his website, and said he was the one who had made the decision. \"After reading hundreds of e-mails, I have made MY decision,\" he wrote. \"By pulling my opening Oct 3rd, You (ESPN) stepped on the Toes of The First Amendment Freedom of Speech, so therefore Me, My Song, and All My Rowdy Friends are OUT OF HERE.
