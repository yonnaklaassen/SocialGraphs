In 1942, he appeared in [[Irving Berlin]]'s ''[[This Is the Army]]'' and became a major star of [[CBS Radio]]. In the 1960s, he successfully crossed over into [[country music]], recording hits such as \"[[A Little Bitty Tear]]\" and \"[[Funny Way of Laughin']]\". Ives was also a popular film actor through the late 1940s and '50s. His film roles included parts in ''[[So Dear to My Heart]]'' (1948) and ''[[Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1958 film)|Cat on a Hot Tin Roof]]'' (1958), as well as the role of Rufus Hannassey in ''[[The Big Country]]'' (1958), for which he won an [[31st Academy Awards|Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]], and the film noir ''[[Day of the Outlaw]]'' (1959).\n\nIves is often associated with the Christmas season. He did voice-over work as Sam the Snowman, narrator of the classic 1964 Christmas television special ''[[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (TV special)|Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer]]''. Ives also worked on the [[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (soundtrack)|special's soundtrack]], including the songs \"[[A Holly Jolly Christmas]]\" and \"[[Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Reindeer (song)|Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer]]\", both of which continue to chart annually on the [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] holiday charts into the 2020s.<ref>{{Cite magazine|title=Holiday 100 Chart|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-holiday-songs|access-date=2021-04-21|magazine=Billboard|date=January 2, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nIves was born in [[Hunt City, Illinois|Hunt City]], an unincorporated town in [[Jasper County, Illinois]], near [[Newton, Illinois|Newton]], to Levi \"Frank\" Ives (1880–1947) and Cordelia \"Dellie\" (née White; 1882–1954). He had six siblings: Audry, Artie, Clarence, Argola, Lillburn, and Norma. His father was first a farmer and then a contractor for the county and others. One day, Ives was singing in the garden with his mother, and his uncle overheard them. He invited his nephew to sing at the old soldiers' reunion in Hunt City. The boy performed a rendition of the folk ballad \"[[Barbara Allen (song)|Barbara Allen]]\" and impressed both his uncle and the audience.<ref>Burl Ives (1948). ''Wayfaring Stranger''.

He was jailed in [[Mona, Utah]], for [[vagrancy (people)|vagrancy]] and for singing \"[[Foggy Dew (English song)|Foggy Dew]]\" (an English folk song), which the authorities decided was a [[bawdy song]].<ref>''Wayfaring Stranger'' pp. 129–132.</ref> Around 1931, he began performing on WBOW radio in [[Terre Haute, Indiana]]. He also went back to school, attending classes at Indiana State Teachers College (now [[Indiana State University]]).<ref>''Wayfaring Stranger'' p. 145.</ref> In 1933, Ives also attended the [[Juilliard School]] in New York. He made his Broadway debut in 1938 with a small role in [[Rodgers and Hart]]'s hit musical, ''[[The Boys from Syracuse]]''. In 1939, he joined his friend and fellow actor [[Eddie Albert]], who had the starring role in ''The Boys from Syracuse'', in Los Angeles. The two shared an apartment for a while in the [[Beachwood Canyon, Los Angeles|Beachwood Canyon]] community of Hollywood.\n\nIn 1940, Ives named his own radio show, ''The Wayfaring Stranger'', after one of his ballads. Over the next decade, he popularized several traditional folk songs, such as \"Foggy Dew\", \"[[The Blue Tail Fly]]\" (an old [[Blackface minstrelsy|minstrel]] tune now better known as \"[[Jimmy Crack Corn]]\"), and \"[[Big Rock Candy Mountain]]\" (an old [[hobo]] song). He was also associated with the [[Almanac Singers|Almanacs]], a folk-singing group which at different times included [[Woody Guthrie]], [[Will Geer]], [[Millard Lampell]], and [[Pete Seeger]]. The Almanacs were active in the [[American Peace Mobilization]] (APM), a far left group initially opposed to American entry into [[World War II]] and [[Franklin Roosevelt]]'s pro-Allied policies. They recorded such songs as \"Get Out and Stay Out of War\" and \"Franklin, Oh Franklin\".<ref name=\"revival\">{{cite journal |first1=Ron |last1=Eyerman |first2=Scott |last2=Barretta |title=The Folk Music Revival in the United States |journal=[[Theory & Society]] |location=New York City |volume=25 |issue=4 |date=August 1996 |pages=501–543 |doi=10.1007/BF00160675|s2cid=142024250 }}</ref>\n\nIn June 1941, after the [[Operation Barbarossa|Axis invasion of the Soviet Union]], the APM abandoned its pacifist stance and reorganized itself into the pro-war American People's Mobilization. Ives and the Almanacs rerecorded several of their songs to reflect the group's new stance in favor of US entry into the war. Among them were \"Dear Mr. President\" and \"Reuben James\" (the name of a [[USS Reuben James (DD-245)|US destroyer sunk by the Germans]] before the official US entry into the war).<ref name=\"revival\"/>\n\nIn early 1942, Ives was drafted into the [[U.S. Army]]. He spent time first at [[Camp Dix]], then at [[Camp Upton]], where he joined the cast of [[Irving Berlin]]'s ''[[This Is the Army]].'' He attained the rank of corporal.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} When the show went to Hollywood, he was transferred to the [[Army Air Force]]s. He was honorably discharged, apparently for medical reasons, in September 1943. Between September and December 1943, Ives lived in California with actor [[Harry Morgan]]. In December 1943, Ives went to [[New York City]] to work for [[CBS Radio]] for $100 a week.<ref>\"Testimony of Burl Icle Ives, New York, N.Y.

The flip side of the record was a fast-paced \"I'm Goin' Down the Road\".

In 1962, he released three songs that were popular with both country music and popular music fans: \"[[A Little Bitty Tear]]\", \"Call Me Mister In-Between\", and \"[[Funny Way of Laughin']]\". His records, recorded in Nashville for [[Decca Records]], were produced by [[Owen Bradley]], one of the record producers who (along with [[Chet Atkins]]) helped define the [[Nashville Sound]] style of country music that expanded the music's appeal to a wider audience. Bradley used the [[Nashville A-Team]] of session musicians behind Ives, including the [[Anita Kerr Singers]], which enhanced Ives' appeal. Bradley also produced the recording of Ives's perennial Holiday favorite \"[[A Holly Jolly Christmas]]\" in Nashville.\n\nIves had several film and television roles during the 1960s and 1970s. In 1961, he sang the folk song, \"[[I Know an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly]]\" for a short film of the same name produced by the [[National Film Board of Canada]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjK4pnbW-6o&ab_channel=NFB | title=I Know an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly | website=[[YouTube]] | date=October 26, 2016 }}</ref> In 1962, he starred with [[Rock Hudson]] in ''[[The Spiral Road]],'' which was based on a novel of the same name by [[Jan de Hartog]].

In 1964, he played the genie in the movie ''[[The Brass Bottle (1964 film)|The Brass Bottle]]'' with [[Tony Randall]] and [[Barbara Eden]].\n\nIves's \"[[A Holly Jolly Christmas]]\" and \"Silver and Gold\" became Christmas standards after they were first featured in the 1964 NBC-TV presentation of the [[Rankin/Bass]] stop-motion animated family special [[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (TV special)|''Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer'']]. [[Johnny Marks]] had composed the title song (originally an enormous hit for singing cowboy [[Gene Autry]]) in 1949, and producers [[Arthur Rankin, Jr.]] and [[Jules Bass]] retained him to compose the TV special's soundtrack. Ives voiced Sam the Snowman, the banjo-playing \"host\" and narrator of the story, explaining how Rudolph used his \"nonconformity\", as Sam refers to it, to save Christmas from being cancelled due to an impassable blizzard. The following year, Ives rerecorded all three of the Johnny Marks hits which he had sung in the TV special, but with a more \"pop\" feel. He released them all as singles for the 1965 holiday season, capitalizing on their previous success.{{citation needed|date=June 2023}} In 2022, 27 years after his death, \"[[A Holly Jolly Christmas]]\", made the [[Billboard Year-End]] chart.<ref>{{cite magazine | title=Hot 100 Songs | magazine=Billboard | date=January 2, 2013 | url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/year-end/hot-100-songs/ | access-date=June 22, 2023}}</ref>\n\nIves performed in other television productions, including ''[[Pinocchio (1968 film)|Pinocchio]]'' and ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]].''\n\nHe starred in short-lived ''O.K.

The Executive Producer was NFL Films founder [[Ed Sabol]], and chief producer was Ed's son, [[Steve Sabol]]. Ed and Steve Sabol are members of the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]].\n\nIves occasionally starred in macabre-themed productions. In 1970, for example, he played the title role in ''The Man Who Wanted to Live Forever'', in which his character attempts to harvest human organs from unwilling donors. In 1972, he appeared as old man Doubleday in the episode \"The Other Way Out\" of [[Rod Serling]]'s ''[[Night Gallery]]'', in which his character seeks a gruesome revenge for the murder of his granddaughter.\n\nIn honor of Ives's influence on American vocal music, on October 25, 1975, he was awarded the [[University of Pennsylvania Glee Club]] Award of Merit.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dolphin.upenn.edu/gleeclub/MEMBERS_merit.html |title = The University of Pennsylvania Glee Club Award of Merit Recipients |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209191432/http://www.dolphin.upenn.edu/gleeclub/MEMBERS_merit.html |archive-date=February 9, 2012 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> This award, initiated in 1964, was \"established to bring a declaration of appreciation to an individual each year who has made a significant contribution to the world of music and helped to create a climate in which our talents may find valid expression.\"\n\nWhen [[America Sings]] opened at [[Disneyland]] in 1974, Ives voiced the main host, Sam Eagle, an [[Audio-Animatronics|Audio-Animatronic]].\n\nIn 1976, Ives was featured as a main character in ''Little House on the Prairie'' season 3 episode 10 titled \"The Hunters\".
