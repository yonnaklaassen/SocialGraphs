He was married four times and for the last six years of his life lived with his long-time love, [[Leona Williams]] (former wife of [[Merle Haggard]]).\n\nHusky suffered from [[cardiopathy]] for many years and was hospitalized several times beginning in the late 1970s, including for heart surgery in 2005 and for blood clots in his legs in 2007. He was admitted to St. John's Hospital in [[Springfield, Missouri]], on April 19, 2009, with [[congestive heart failure]] and [[pneumonia]]. On July 15, 2009, his spokesman said he was recuperating at home after being released from a Nashville hospital.\n\nOn February 23, 2010, the [[Country Music Association]] announced his induction into the Country Music Hall of Fame. He was heralded for his vocal and comic prowess—and \"all around showmanship\"—that left a legacy as \"one of the best entertainers country music has ever produced\".\n\nOn January 16, 2011, he was honored at West St. Francois County High School in [[Leadwood, Missouri]], where local singers and the high-school choir sang some of his hits. Husky also donated several items of memorabilia, including his Country Music Hall of Fame award, to the city of Leadwood which are permanently stored at the high school.\n\nOn March 8, 2011, Husky was hospitalized again after several days after not feeling well. By the weekend, he had improved and moved out of the [[coronary care unit]].
