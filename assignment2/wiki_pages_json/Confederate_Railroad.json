After serving as a backing band for [[outlaw country]] acts [[David Allan Coe]] and [[Johnny Paycheck]], the band signed to a recording contract with [[Atlantic Records]], releasing their self-titled debut album that year. In the 1990s, they released four more albums for Atlantic.\n\nConfederate Railroad has released six studio albums. In addition, 18 of their singles have entered the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts.\n\nThe band's most recent studio album, ''Lucky to Be Alive'', was issued on the D&B Masterworks label on July 15, 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/life/entertainment/story/2016/jul/15/not-ready-retire-work-just-keeps-coming-confe/375866/|title=Hixson's Danny Shirley and the Confederate Railroad still in demand 40 years after his professional debut|date=15 July 2016 |access-date=2016-08-05}}</ref> The band released their first live album, ''Confederate Railroad Live: Back to the Barrooms'', on the [[Koch Entertainment|E1 Music]] label on June 15, 2010.\n\n==History==\nConfederate Railroad was founded in 1987 by [[Danny Shirley]], Michael Lamb, Gates Nichols (May 26, 1944 – August 14, 2009),<ref name=obit1/> Chris McDaniel, Wayne Secrest (April 29, 1950 – June 2, 2018),<ref name=obit2/> and Mark Dufresne.

The album produced six hit singles and was certified 2× Platinum in the U.S.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> In 1993, Confederate Railroad was awarded Best New Group at the [[Academy of Country Music|ACM]] awards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://countrymusic.about.com/library/reviews/aaprunleashed.htm|title=Who Is Country Star David Allan Coe?|access-date=2007-03-02|archive-date=2011-09-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928045419/http://countrymusic.about.com/library/reviews/aaprunleashed.htm|url-status=dead}}</ref> In order of release, these singles were \"She Took It Like a Man,\" \"Jesus and Mama,\" \"[[Queen of Memphis]],\" (their highest chart peak, at no.&nbsp;2) \"When You Leave That Way You Can Never Go Back,\" \"[[Trashy Women]],\" and \"She Never Cried.\"\n\n''[[Notorious (Confederate Railroad album)|Notorious]]'' was the band's second album. Released in 1994, it was certified platinum as well. The album was led off by the no.&nbsp;9 \"[[Daddy Never Was the Cadillac Kind]],\" followed by the no.&nbsp;20 \"Elvis and Andy,\" and finally \"Summer in Dixie,\" which failed to make Top 40. Also in 1994, Shirley and [[Mark Collie]] co-wrote and sang guest vocals on [[Billy Ray Cyrus]]'s \"Redneck Heaven,\" an album cut from his 1994 disc ''[[Storm in the Heartland]]''.<ref>{{Cite AV media notes |title=Storm in the Heartland |others=Billy Ray Cyrus |year=1994 |type=CD booklet |publisher=Mercury Records |id=314-526 081-2}}</ref>\n\nOne year later, the band released its third album, 1995's ''[[When and Where]]''. This album failed to sell as well as its predecessors, and was less successful on the charts as well. Lead-off single \"When and Where\" reached No.&nbsp;24, while the other three singles – \"Bill's Laundromat, Bar and Grill,\" \"When He Was My Age,\" and \"See Ya\" all failed to reach Top 40. A ''[[Greatest Hits (Confederate Railroad album)|Greatest Hits]]'' package followed in 1996.\n\nIn 1998, the band released its fourth and final studio album for Atlantic, titled ''Keep on Rockin'''. Its only two singles were \"The Big One\" and \"Cowboy Cadillac,\" both of which failed to reach the Top 60 on the country singles charts. After another compilation titled ''Rockin' Country Party Pack'' (which produced another chart single in \"Toss a Little Bone,\" previously from ''When and Where''), the band exited Atlantic.\n\nOne year later, Confederate Railroad signed to Audium/Koch Records (now [[E1 Music]]) for its fifth studio album, ''Unleashed''. It was led off by the no.&nbsp;39 \"What Brothers Do.\" Although this was the band's first Top 40 country hit since \"When and Where\" in 1995, the other singles – \"She Treats Her Body Like a Temple\" and \"White Trash with Money\" – both failed to reach Top 40.\n\nThe band did not record again until 2007's ''Cheap Thrills'', an album of [[cover song]]s. This album was led off by a cover of \"[[Please Come to Boston]],\" which failed to chart.\n\nConfederate Railroad members signed a record deal with E1 Music in 2010 and released their first-ever live album called \"Confederate Railroad Live: Back to the Barrooms.\" Cody McCarver of Confederate Railroad also signed to the label and has recently had success{{vague|date=April 2020}} with Confederate Railroad's song \"White Trash with Money\" which was written by Confederate Railroad's Danny Shirley with songwriter Buck Moore. The video by Cody also featured Jimmy Dormire who left Confederate Railroad in 2008. Cody McCarver released a single and video called \"I'm America.\"\n\nSince 2019, the band has missed bookings and had concerts cancelled because of concerns over the band's name and their logo's inclusion of two [[Confederate flag]]s. In cancelling their planned performance at the [[Ulster County, New York#Recreation|Ulster County Fair]], organizers said the event must represent \"the values of all members of our community\" and that \"showcasing of a symbol of division and racism runs counter to that principle.\"\n\nCritics say that the Confederate flag is a racist symbol, representing a [[United States Civil War|war to continue slavery]] and [[racial segregation in the United States]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Kaur |first=Harmeet |url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/01/entertainment/confederate-railroad-name-backlash-trnd/index.html |title=Confederate Railroad says it won't change its name |publisher=CNN |date=2019-08-01 |access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref> The band said the cancellation was \"very disappointing\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.confederaterailroad.com/press-release.htm |title=Press release |publisher=Confederate Railroad |access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref> Shirley says the flag represents history and Southern heritage.<ref>{{cite web|agency=Associated Press |url=https://www.sj-r.com/news/20190725/country-band-confederate-railroad-nixed-from-another-fair |title=Country band Confederate Railroad nixed from another fair - News - The State Journal-Register - Springfield, IL |publisher=Sj-r.com |date=2019-07-25 |access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>\n\nShirley blamed [[J.

To Date, Cody has released 2 Country Music Albums & 4 Gospel Albums. He's also worked on some Western Independent Films and his most recent work was with [[John Schneider (screen actor)|John Schneider]] working on his album and being a costar in his movie \"Stand on It\" as well as the sequel \"Poker Run.\" He is currently on the road touring with John Schneider in his band where he also opens the show with his own music.\n\nIn June 2008, Jimmy Dormire announced that he was leaving Confederate Railroad to continue his solo career, though he continues as a member of Cody McCarver's band. Dormire was subsequently replaced by Rusty Hendrix, former side man for Mark Wills and Sammy Kershaw. Jimmy was part of the Cody McCarver band, and became a regular in the John Schneider band before joining to Country Band [[BlackHawk (band)|BlackHawk]] and the [[Outlaws (band)|Outlaws]] as a Full time Member.\n\nGates Nichols retired from Confederate Railroad in December 2008, and in July of the following year, he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.
