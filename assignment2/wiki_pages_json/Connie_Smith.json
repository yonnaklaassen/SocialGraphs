Her [[contralto]] vocals have been described by music writers as significant and influential to the women of country music. A similarity has been noted between her vocal style and the stylings of country vocalist [[Patsy Cline]]. Other performers have cited Smith as influence on their own singing styles, which has been reflected in quotes and interviews over the years.\n\nDiscovered in 1963, Smith signed with [[RCA Victor Records]] the following year and remained with the label until 1973. Her debut single \"[[Once a Day]]\" was nominated at the [[Grammy Awards]] for [[Best Female Country Vocal Performance]] and reached number one on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] chart in November 1964 and remained at the top position for eight weeks, the first time a female artist had achieved this feat, with Smith holding the record for over 50 years until it was broken by [[Trisha Yearwood]]. The song became Smith's biggest hit. Smith's success continued through 1960s and mid 1970s with 19 more top-10 hits (including \"[[Then and Only Then]]\"; \"[[Ain't Had No Lovin']]\"; \"[[Cincinnati, Ohio (song)|Cincinnati, Ohio]]\"; \"[[I Never Once Stopped Loving You (song)|I Never Once Stopped Loving You]]\"; and \"[[Ain't Love a Good Thing]]\") on the country songs chart.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Smith began recording [[Gospel music]] more frequently as she became more serious in her Christianity. As she focused more heavily on religion, Smith became known for her outspoken religious demeanor at concerts and music venues. At the same time, Smith spent more time raising her five children than focusing on music. She eventually went into semi-retirement in 1979. Smith returned to recording briefly in the mid-1980s with [[Epic Records]]. However, it was not until her collaboration with [[Marty Stuart]] in the 1990s that she returned permanently. Their musical friendship became romantic, leading to their marriage in 1997. The pairing led to ''[[Connie Smith (1998 album)|Connie Smith]]'', Smith's first studio album in 20 years. Critically acclaimed, Smith began performing again and has recorded two more studio albums.\n\nSmith has been nominated for 11 [[Grammy Awards]], including eight nominations for Best Female Country Vocal Performance. She has also been nominated for one [[Academy of Country Music]] award and three [[Country Music Association]] awards. ''Rolling Stone'' included her on its list of the 100 greatest country music artists and ''[[CMT (U.S. TV channel)|CMT]]'' ranked her among the top 10 in its list of the 40 greatest women of country music. She has been a member of the [[Grand Ole Opry]] cast since 1965. In 2012, Smith was inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]].\n\n==Early life==\nConnie Smith was born Constance June Meador to parents Wilma and Hobart Meador in Elkhart, Indiana.<ref name=\"allmusicbio\">{{cite web |last1=Bush |first1=John |title=Connie Smith: Biography |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/connie-smith-mn0000099753/biography |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=9 May 2022}}</ref> Her parents were originally from West Virginia, and when Smith was five months old, the family returned there.

He invited her to perform with him on [[Ernest Tubb]]'s ''[[Midnite Jamboree]]'' program in Nashville, Tennessee. When Smith performed on the program in March 1964, she found out that she would not be performing with Anderson, but instead with [[Ernest Tubb]].

However, the label dismissed Davis before they could work together. Instead, producer [[Billy Sherrill]] chose to work with Smith. However, a disagreement about religion ended the pairing before it began. She started recording alongside producer [[George Richey]], who recently had success writing material for [[George Jones]] and [[Tammy Wynette]].{{sfn|Mazor|2021|p=11}}\n\nAt Columbia, Smith was pressured into recording with more pop production than before. \"From Day One at the new label, even more than before, it was a constant tussle, because I just am who I am,\" recalled Smith.{{sfn|Mazor|2021|p=9}} However, she remained active in song selection and the recording process.{{sfn|Mazor|2021|p=18-21}} Smith's first Columbia LP titled ''[[A Lady Named Smith]]'' (1973) included pop production such as string instrumentation and overdubbed background vocals.{{sfn|Mazor|2021|p=37-39}} The LP reached number 31 on the ''Billboard'' country albums chart.<ref name=\"Country Albums\"/> Richey agreed to release \"[[Ain't Love a Good Thing]]\" as her first Columbia single.

The decision disappointed Smith enough that she chose to end their professional relationship.{{sfn|Mazor|2021|p=12}} The last Richey-produced project was Smith's first Columbia gospel LP, titled ''[[God Is Abundant]]''.

When reviewing the compilation, ''Connie Smith Sings Her Hits'', Thom Jurek of Allmusic commented that she lost the \"grain\" in her voice. Jurek went on to write \"It could be said, that regardless of the material, she never made a bad record; the tunes were carefully chosen it's true, but she never tried to hide the hardcore twang in her vocal style.\"<ref name=\"singsherhits\"/> Smith's biographer, Barry Mazor, found her voice to \"lower in range by this point\" and saw evidence of Columbia attempting to \"push her recorded vocal into the upper end of her range\".{{sfn|Mazor|2021|p=13}} Other critics noticed stylistic changes but observed no change in her singing.

While most Nashville Sound recordings of the time mainly included full orchestras, Smith's sound remained more traditional with its use of [[steel guitar]] and her twangy vocals, while still featuring some pop-influenced instrumentation to provide urban pop appeal. Critics have largely praised Smith's use of the steel guitar, which have often been described as \"sharp\" and \"prominent\".<ref name=\"roughguide\"/> Her steel guitar player [[Weldon Myrick]] is often credited with creating what Smith has called \"The Connie Smith Sound\". In an interview with [[Colin Escott]] in his book ''Born to Sing'', Myrick recalls how Smith's producer ([[Bob Ferguson (music)|Bob Ferguson]]) wanted the guitar to sound: \"He came out and said he wanted a bright sound, and he adjusted my controls. I thought it was an awfully thin sound, but it wound up being very popular.\"{{sfn|Escott|2001|p=12}}\n\nSmith's vocal delivery has also been considered to be part of her musical style.

Bufwack and Robert K.

Mary A. Bufwack and Robert K. Oermann categorized her as one of country's \"heroines of heartbreak\", due to her emotional vocal delivery. Bufwack and Oermann further stated that along with [[Tammy Wynette]], Smith was among the genre's \"most towering country voices of the 1960s and 1970s\" who \"sang from the depths of despair\" and \"spoke for conservative Middle America in both music and life.\"{{sfn|Bufwack|Oermann|2003|p=292}}\n\nMany artists in the country music industry have cited Smith as a significant musical influence or one of their favorite musical artists. [[George Jones]] cited Smith as his favorite female singer in his 1995 autobiography.<ref name=\"countryuniverse\"/> [[Elvis Presley]] had many of Smith's albums in his record collection at his [[Graceland]] home and intended to record Smith's version of \"[[The Wonders You Perform]]\", but never got around to doing so.<ref name=\"interview\"/> In a discussion with country songwriter [[Fred Foster]], [[Dolly Parton]] famously said, \"You know, there's really only three female singers in the world: [[Barbra Streisand]], [[Linda Ronstadt]], and Connie Smith.
