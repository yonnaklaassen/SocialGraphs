He later began a recording career and reached the peak of his fame in the mid-1960s, continuing to record and tour into the 1990s, charting his final top 20 country hit \"[[Old Friends (Willie Nelson album)|Old Friends]]\" with Price and [[Willie Nelson]] in 1982. He also wrote and performed several of the songs for the 1973 Disney animated film ''[[Robin Hood (1973 film)|Robin Hood]]''. Later in his life, he wrote the music and lyrics for the 1985 [[Tony Award]]−winning Broadway musical ''[[Big River (musical)|Big River]]'', in which he played Pap Finn in 1986.\n\nMiller died from lung cancer in 1992 and was inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] three years later. His songs continued to be recorded by other singers, with covers of \"[[Tall, Tall Trees]]\" by [[Alan Jackson]] and \"[[Husbands and Wives (song)|Husbands and Wives]]\" by [[Brooks & Dunn]]; both reached the number one spot on country charts in the 1990s. The [[Roger Miller Museum]] — now closed — in his home town of [[Erick, Oklahoma]], was a tribute to Miller.\n\n== Early life ==\nRoger Miller was born in [[Fort Worth, Texas]], the third son of Jean and Laudene (Holt) Miller. Jean Miller died from spinal meningitis when Miller was a year old. Unable to support the family during the [[Great Depression]],<ref name=\"bio\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rogermiller.com/bio1.html |title=Biography |publisher=rogermiller.com |access-date=July 11, 2010 }}</ref> Laudene sent her three sons to live with three of Jean's brothers.

He later said he was \"dirt poor\" and that as late as 1951 the family did not own a telephone.<ref name=\"high\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rogermiller.com/SchoolPaper.html |title=High School Papers |publisher=rogermiller.com |access-date=July 11, 2010 }}</ref> He received his primary education at a one-room schoolhouse. Miller was an introverted child who often daydreamed or composed songs. One of his earliest compositions went: \"There's a picture on the wall. It's the dearest of them all, Mother.\"<ref name=\"bio\" />\n\nMiller was a member of the [[National FFA Organization|FFA]] in high school.<ref name=\"high\" /> He listened to the ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'' and [[Light Crust Doughboys]] on a Fort Worth station with his cousin's husband, [[Sheb Wooley]]. Wooley taught Miller his first guitar chords and bought him a fiddle. Wooley, [[Hank Williams]], and [[Bob Wills]] were the influences that led to Miller's desire to be a singer-songwriter. He began to run away and perform in Oklahoma and Texas. At 17, he stole a [[guitar]] out of desperation to write songs; however, he turned himself in the next day. He chose to enlist in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] to avoid [[jail]]. He later quipped, \"My education was [[Korean War|Korea, Clash of '52]].\" Near the end of his military service, while stationed in Atlanta, Georgia, Miller played fiddle in the \"Circle A Wranglers\", a military musical group started by [[Faron Young]].<ref name=\"bio\" /> While Miller was stationed in [[South Carolina]], an army sergeant whose brother was [[Kenneth C. \"Jethro\" Burns]], from the musical duo [[Homer and Jethro]], persuaded him to head to Nashville after his discharge.<ref name=\"enc\" />\n\n== Career ==\n=== Nashville songwriter ===\nOn leaving the Army, Miller traveled to Nashville to begin his musical career. He met with [[Chet Atkins]], who asked to hear him sing, loaning him a guitar since Miller did not own one. Out of nervousness, Miller played the guitar and sang a song in two different keys. Atkins advised him to come back later, when he had more experience. Miller found work as a bellhop at Nashville's Andrew Jackson Hotel, and he was soon known as the \"singing bellhop.\" He was finally hired by [[Minnie Pearl]] to play the fiddle in her band.<ref name=\"cmt\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/miller_roger_country_/bio.jhtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040315095610/http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/miller_roger_country_/bio.jhtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=March 15, 2004 |title=Roger Miller Biography |publisher=[[Country Music Television|CMT]] |access-date=July 11, 2010}}</ref> He then met [[George Jones]], who introduced him to music executives from the [[Starday Records]] label who scheduled an audition. Impressed, the executives set up a recording session with Jones in [[Houston]]. Jones and Miller collaborated to write \"Tall, Tall Trees\" and \"Happy Child.\"<ref name=\"bio\" />\n\n{{quote box| width = 20%| quote=The human mind is a wonderful thing.

He wrote: \"Half a Mind\" for [[Ernest Tubb]], \"That's the Way I Feel\" for [[Faron Young]]; and his first number one, \"Billy Bayou\", which along with \"Home\" was recorded by [[Jim Reeves]]. Miller became one of the biggest songwriters of the 1950s. [[Bill Anderson (country music)|Bill Anderson]] later remarked that \"Roger was the most talented, and least disciplined, person that you could imagine\", citing the attempts of Miller's Tree Publishing boss, [[Buddy Killen]] to force him to finish a piece. He was known to give away lines, inciting many Nashville songwriters to follow him around since, according to Killen, \"everything he said was a potential song.\"<ref name=\"bio\" />\n\n=== Recording career ===\nMiller signed a recording deal with [[Decca Records]] in 1958. He was paired with singer Donny Lytle, who later gained fame under the name [[Johnny Paycheck]], to perform the Miller-written \"A Man Like Me\", and later \"The Wrong Kind of Girl\". Neither of these [[honky-tonk]]-style songs charted. His second single with the label, featuring the B-side \"Jason Fleming\", foreshadowed Miller's future style. To make money, Miller went on tour with Faron Young's band as a drummer, although he had never drummed. During this period, he signed a record deal with Chet Atkins at [[RCA Victor]], for whom Miller recorded \"You Don't Want My Love\" (also known as \"In the Summertime\") in 1960, which marked his first appearance on country charts, peaking at No.&nbsp;14. The next year he made an even bigger impact, breaking through the top 10 with his single \"When Two Worlds Collide\", cowritten with Bill Anderson.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.countryweekly.com/vault/story-behind-song-when-two-worlds-collide|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141009195512/http://www.countryweekly.com/vault/story-behind-song-when-two-worlds-collide|url-status=dead|archive-date=October 9, 2014|title=Country Music News – Nash Country Daily|website=Countryweekly.com}}</ref> But Miller soon tired of writing songs, divorced his wife, and began a party lifestyle that earned him the moniker \"wild child.\" He was dropped from his record label and began to pursue other interests.<ref name=\"bio\" />\n\nAfter numerous appearances on late night comedy shows, Miller decided that he might have a chance in Hollywood as an actor. Short of money, he signed with the up-and-coming label [[Smash Records]], asked the label for $1,600 in cash in exchange for recording 16 sides. Smash agreed to the proposal, and Miller performed his first session for the company early in 1964, when he recorded the hits \"Dang Me\" and \"[[Chug-a-Lug (Roger Miller song)|Chug-a-Lug]]\". Both were released as singles, peaking at No.&nbsp;1 and No.&nbsp;3 respectively on country charts; both fared well on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] reaching No.&nbsp;7 and No.&nbsp;9.<ref name=\"all\" /> The songs transformed Miller's career, although the former was penned by Miller in just four minutes. Later that year, he recorded the No.&nbsp;15 hit \"[[Do-Wacka-Do]]\", and soon after, the biggest hit of his career \"[[King of the Road (song)|King of the Road]]\", which topped Country and Adult Contemporary charts while peaking at No.&nbsp;4 on the Billboard 100. It also reached No.&nbsp;1 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] for one week in May 1965. The song was inspired by a sign in Chicago that read \"Trailers for Sale or Rent\" and a [[hobo]] who happened upon Miller at an airport in [[Boise, Idaho|Boise]], but Miller needed months to write the song, which was certified gold in May 1965 after selling a million copies. It won numerous awards and earned a royalty check of $160,000 that summer.<ref name=\"bio\" /> \n\nLater in 1965 Miller scored hits with \"Engine Engine No.&nbsp;9\", \"Kansas City Star\" (a [[Hot Country Songs|Top Ten country hit]] about a local television children's show personality who would rather stay in the safety and security of his success in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] than become a bigger star – or risk failure – in [[Omaha]]), and \"[[England Swings]]\" (an [[Adult contemporary music|adult contemporary]] No.&nbsp;1). He began 1966 with the hit \"[[Husbands and Wives (song)|Husbands and Wives]], a mid-tempo waltz reflecting on issues that affect marriages.\"<ref name=\"all\">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p13680/charts-awards/billboard-singles|pure_url=yes}} |title=Roger Miller > Charts & Awards > Billboard Singles |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=July 11, 2010}}{{dead link|date=October 2019}}</ref>\n\nMiller was given [[The Roger Miller Show|his own TV show on NBC]] in September 1966. It lasted for 13 weeks, and it ended its run in January 1967. During this period Miller recorded songs written by other songwriters. The final hit of his own composition was \"Walkin in the Sunshine\", which reached No.&nbsp;7 and No.&nbsp;6 on the country and adult contemporary charts in 1967.<ref name=\"all\" /> Later in the year he scored his final top 10 hit with the first recording of [[Bobby Russell]]'s \"[[Little Green Apples]]\".<ref name=\"bio\" /> The next year, he was first to cover [[Kris Kristofferson]]'s \"[[Me and Bobby McGee]],\"<ref name=\"hall\" /> taking the song to No.&nbsp;12 on country charts.<ref name=\"all\" /> In 1970, Miller recorded the album ''A Trip in the Country'', honky-tonk-style standards penned by Miller, including \"Tall, Tall Trees.\" Later that year, after Smash Records folded, Miller was signed by [[Columbia Records]], for whom he released ''Dear Folks: Sorry I Haven't Written Lately'' in 1973. Later that year, Miller wrote and performed three songs in the Walt Disney animated feature ''[[Robin Hood (1973 film)|Robin Hood]]'' as the rooster and minstrel [[Allan-a-Dale]]: \"[[Oo-De-Lally]]\", \"[[Not in Nottingham]]\", and \"Whistle-Stop\" (which was sampled for use in the popular [[Hampster Dance]] web site).<ref name=\"bio\" /> He provided the voice of Speiltoe, the equine narrator of the [[Rankin/Bass]] holiday special ''[[Nestor the Long-Eared Christmas Donkey]]'' in 1977. Miller collaborated with Willie Nelson on an album titled ''Old Friends.'' The title track was based on a song he had previously penned for his family in Oklahoma. The song, with guest vocals from Ray Price, was the last hit of Miller's career,<ref name=\"bio\" /> peaking at No.&nbsp;19 on country charts in 1982.<ref name=\"all\" />\n\n=== Late career ===\nIn 1970, Miller opened the King of the Road Inn, a Nashville hotel.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tennessean.com/picture-gallery/entertainment/music/2021/01/15/nashville-then-best-music-photos-50-years-ago-1970/4086866001/|website=The Tennessean|title=Nashville Then: Best 1970 music photos have a little bit of this and that and lot of country|date=January 14, 2021|accessdate=October 30, 2022}}</ref> As [[Brian Carpenter (musician)|Brian Carpenter]] wrote in ''[[Southern Cultures]]'', \"With its rooftop lounge and accompanying penthouse suite (complete with a swinging double bed), Miller's King of the Road Inn was, for a time, the unofficial center of Nashville's thriving music scene.\"<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ugLVBQAAQBAJ&dq=%22roger+miller%22+%22king+of+the+road+inn%22+nashville&pg=PA120|page=120|first=Brian|last=Carpenter|title=Dashboard Poet: Roger Miller|issue=Winter 2014|date=November 21, 2014|publisher=UNC Press Books |isbn=9781469615967 |accessdate=October 30, 2022}}</ref> It is now called the Clarion Hotel Downtown Nashville-Stadium.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.frommers.com/destinations/nashville/hotels/clarion-hotel-downtown-nashville-stadium|website=Frommers|title=Clarion Hotel Downtown Nashville-Stadium|accessdate=October 30, 2022}}</ref>\n\nMiller continued to record for different record labels and charted a few songs, but stopped writing in 1978, feeling that his more \"artistic\" works were not appreciated.<ref name=\"enc\" /> He was absent from the entertainment business following the release of ''Old Friends'' in 1981, but returned after receiving an offer to write a Broadway score for a musical based upon [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]].''
