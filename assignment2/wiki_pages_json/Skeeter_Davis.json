She started out as part of [[The Davis Sisters (country)|the Davis Sisters]] as a teenager in the late 1940s, eventually landing on [[RCA Victor]]. In the late 1950s, she became a solo star.\n\nOne of the first women to achieve major stardom in the country music field as a solo vocalist, she was an acknowledged influence on [[Tammy Wynette]] and [[Dolly Parton]] and was hailed as an \"extraordinary country/pop singer\" by ''[[The New York Times]]'' music critic [[Robert Palmer (American writer)|Robert Palmer]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/15/arts/critics-choices-pop-music.html|title=Critics' Choice; Pop Music|last=Palmer|first=Robert|date=December 15, 1985|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=August 5, 2018}} {{closed access}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nDavis was born Mary Frances Penick on December 30, 1931,{{sfn|Davis|1993|p=7}} the first of seven children born to farmer William Lee and Sarah Rachel Penick (née Roberts), in [[Glencoe, Kentucky]].{{efn|Some sources list Davis's birthplace as [[Dry Ridge, Kentucky]], where she spent her early childhood.<ref>{{Citation |publication-date=September 21, 2004 |title=Deaths |publisher= [[The Tennessean]] |page=W11 |url=http://waxmuseum.net/SkeeterDavis.html |access-date=November 10, 2013}}</ref> However, in her 1993 autobiography, she states that she was in fact born in a small cabin along the bank of [[Eagle Creek (Kentucky)|Eagle Creek]] in [[Glencoe, Kentucky]].{{sfn|Davis|1993|p=7}}}} Because her grandfather thought she had a lot of energy for a young child, he nicknamed Mary Frances \"Skeeter\" (slang for [[mosquito]]), a name she carried for the rest of her life.{{sfn|Davis|1993|p=33}}\n\n[[File:Skeeter Davis in 1941.png|thumb|upright=.6|left|Davis in a school photo, at the age of ten]]\nWhen Davis was a [[toddler]], her great-uncle was convicted of murdering her maternal grandfather (his brother) in [[Indiana]].{{sfn|Davis|1993|pages=10–11}} After this incident, Davis recalled that her mother became a \"bitterly depressed woman\".{{sfn|Davis|1993|p=20}} Throughout her childhood, Davis's mother made multiple [[suicide]] attempts, several of which Davis herself prevented from being carried out: \"I once slapped a bottle of [[Bleach|Clorox]] she was drinking out of her mouth and sat on her hands to keep her from reaching for a butcher knife,\" she recalled.{{sfn|Davis|1993|p=21}} On one occasion, her mother attempted to leap from the family's apartment window with Davis and her infant brother in her arms.{{sfn|Davis|1993|p=21}} Her relationship with her mother remained strained throughout much of her life, and by Davis's account, she \"couldn't seem to win my mother's respect and affection, [so] I turned my attention toward my daddy.\"{{sfn|Davis|1993|p=57}}\n\nIn the mid-1930s, the Penick family relocated to [[Cincinnati]], Ohio, where they remained for several years before returning to Dry Ridge.{{sfn|Davis|1993|p=22}} They later moved to [[Erlanger, Kentucky]], in 1947. Davis was raised a [[Protestantism|Protestant]], attending [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)|Disciples of Christ]] churches.{{sfn|Davis|1993|p=47}} As an adolescent, Davis was inspired by the music of [[Betty Hutton]] and also developed interest in musicals, memorizing songs from films such as ''[[Stage Door Canteen (film)|Stage Door Canteen]]'' (1943) and ''[[I'll Be Seeing You (1944 film)|I'll Be Seeing You]]'' (1944).{{sfn|Davis|1993|p=54}} She would sometimes stage routines in her backyard, dancing, singing, and telling [[ghost story|ghost stories]] to neighborhood children.{{sfn|Davis|1993|p=55}} When Davis was in seventh grade, her father relocated to [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]], for work.{{sfn|Davis|1993|pages=64–66}} She and her siblings remained in the care of their mother who, during this time, became an [[alcoholism|alcoholic]].{{sfn|Davis|1993|p=87}} In the summer of 1948, Davis and her family relocated to [[Covington, Kentucky]], where her father was working as an electrician and moved into a house owned by the [[Villa Madonna Academy]], run by [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine nuns]].{{sfn|Davis|1993|p=94}} Davis became fascinated by the sisters, and for a time considered becoming a nun.{{sfn|Davis|1993|p=108}}\n\nWhile attending [[Dixie Heights High School]] in Erlanger, Skeeter met Betty Jack Davis, and the two became close friends, bonding over their love of music.{{sfn|Davis|1993|pages=99–104}} They began singing songs and playing [[guitar]] together during breaks at school, which drew attention from their classmates,{{sfn|Davis|1993|p=103}} and they performed in several school talent shows.{{sfn|Davis|1993|pages=103–105}} On a trip to the [[Grand Ole Opry]], the two convinced a stage manager to allow them backstage, where they met [[Hank Williams]] and [[Chet Atkins]].{{sfn|Davis|1993|p=107}}\n\n==Career==\n===1948–1956: The Davis Sisters; rise to fame===\n{{Main|The Davis Sisters (country band)}}\nDuring her junior year of high school, Skeeter and Betty Jack Davis won a local [[yodeling]] contest, whose prize was a time slot singing on a local daytime television show.{{sfn|Davis|1993|p=117}} The two were billed as the [[The Davis Sisters (country band)|Davis Sisters]], with Skeeter adopting Betty Jack's last name, despite their being unrelated.{{sfn|Davis|1993|pages=117–118}} Their appearance on the local program led to them receiving singing opportunities on the [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]] radio station [[WJR]]'s program ''Barnyard Frolics''.{{sfn|Davis|1993|pages=122–123}} After graduating from high school in 1949, Davis relocated to Detroit with Betty Jack, where they completed demonstration recordings for [[Fortune Records]]; among these were the song \"Jealous Love\", which was released as a single in 1953.{{sfn|Davis|1993|p=127}}\n\n[[RCA Victor]] producer [[Steve Sholes]] heard their demos and was impressed by their harmonies. In the spring of 1953, Skeeter and Betty Jack met with Sholes at the RCA headquarters in [[New York City]], who offered them a recording contract.{{sfn|Davis|1993|pages=128–130}} After signing the contract, they left New York to begin recording material in [[Nashville, Tennessee]].{{sfn|Davis|1993|p=130}} On May 23, 1953, they recorded \"[[I Forgot More Than You'll Ever Know]]\", a song that had previously been recorded by [[Sonny James]].{{sfn|Davis|1993|pages=133–134}} The Davis Sisters toured regionally to support the single on live broadcast radio programs, though Davis recalled that both \"were so insecure and uninformed about the [music] business.\"{{sfn|Davis|1993|p=139}} The single was a significant success, spending eight weeks at number one on the country charts in 1953,{{sfn|Whitburn|2006|p=101}} as well as making the top 20 on the pop charts. The record ranks number 65 on the Top 100 Country Singles of All Time, according to ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' historian [[Joel Whitburn]].\n\nOn August 1, 1953, the Davis Sisters performed on the [[WWVA (AM)|WWVA]] evening show in [[Wheeling, West Virginia]].{{sfn|Davis|1993|p=145}} After midnight, the two left Wheeling en route back to Covington.

She recounted in her autobiography that Ollie \"took advantage of this tragic situation to suit her own ends,\" alleging that she had kept Skeeter sedated with drugs administered from a local dentist and sequestered her in the house, where she repeatedly played the girls' records.{{sfn|Davis|1993|pages=150–153}} Once Skeeter recovered, Ollie could \"hardly wait for her chance to re-create the Davis Sisters,\" suggesting that Betty Jack's younger sister, Georgia, take her place in the singing duo.{{sfn|Davis|1993|p=157}} Davis reluctantly agreed, and six months after the accident, she resumed singing in the duo with Georgia Davis.{{sfn|Davis|1993|p=158}} In her autobiography, she wrote that she felt she had been [[brainwashing|brainwashed]] by Ollie and coerced into resuming the musical duo.{{sfn|Davis|1993|pages=158–160}}\n\nBetween 1954 and 1956, Skeeter and Georgia released a total of nine singles for RCA as the Davis Sisters, which they recorded in New York City and [[Chicago]], and toured the United States as a part of the RCA Caravan of the Stars alongside [[Minnie Pearl]], [[Hawkshaw Hawkins]], and Chet Atkins, among others.{{sfn|Davis|1993|p=160}} The singles recorded with Georgia were notably less successful than the duo's former material, with low chart positions, though Davis felt that \"the material was good.\"{{sfn|Davis|1993|p=160}} The two held a tribute performance for Betty Jack at the Grand Ole Opry in 1954.{{sfn|Davis|1993|p=161}} In 1955, the Davis Sisters were booked for a regional tour alongside [[Hank Snow]], [[The Carter Sisters]] (minus [[June Carter|June]]), and [[Elvis Presley]].{{sfn|Davis|1993|p=165}} Davis recounted her friendship with Presley in her autobiography.{{sfn|Davis|1993|pages=165–169}} The Davis Sisters formally disbanded in 1956, shortly after Davis's first marriage to Kenneth DePew.{{sfn|Erlewine|1997|p=116}}\n\n===1957–1962: Early solo career===\n[[File:Skeeter Davis 1960s portrait.jpg|thumb|right|upright=.8|Davis in a publicity photo {{circa}} 1960]]\nIn the late 1950s during her marriage to DePew, Davis suffered from [[clinical depression|depression]] and \"harbored a death wish\" over the grief of Betty Jack's death as well as her \"contrived\" marriage.{{sfn|Davis|1993|pages=174, 183}} She resumed performing as a solo act, touring with [[Ernest Tubb]], and co-wrote and recorded the song \"[[Set Him Free]]\" for RCA, produced by Chet Atkins.{{sfn|Davis|1993|p=183}} The song earned Davis a [[Grammy Award]] nomination for best country recording.{{sfn|Davis|1993|p=183}} Sometime during this period, {{circa}} 1958, Davis and DePew were divorced, and she relocated to Nashville.{{sfn|Davis|1993|pages=186–187}} The same year, Davis recorded \"[[Lost to a Geisha Girl]]\", an [[answer song]] to [[Hank Locklin]]'s hit \"Geisha Girl\", which reached the country number 15 and became her first solo hit.{{sfn|Whitburn|2005|p=108}} Atkins worked with Davis as a guitarist on all of these sessions. At Davis's suggestion, Atkins frequently multiple-tracked Davis's voice for harmony vocals to resemble the sound of the Davis Sisters.{{sfn|Davis|1993|p=163}} This echo can be found on several of her early solo hits, such as \"[[Am I That Easy to Forget]]\".{{sfn|Davis|1993|p=197}}\n\nShe subsequently co-wrote and recorded another top-20 hit called \"[[Homebreaker]]\", which peaked at number 15 on the [[Hot Country Songs]] chart in November 1959.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/skeeter-davis/chart-history/country-songs/song/836410|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180911053549/https://www.billboard.com/music/skeeter-davis/chart-history/country-songs/song/836410|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 11, 2018|title=Homebreaker – Chart History|access-date=September 10, 2018}}</ref> The same year, Davis joined the [[Grand Ole Opry]].{{sfn|Davis|1993|p=197}} During this time, she toured with [[June Carter]], and the two became good friends.{{sfn|Davis|1993|p=195}}\n\nFrom 1960 to 1962, Davis had top-10 hits with the songs \"[[(I Can't Help You) I'm Falling Too]]\", \"[[My Last Date (With You)]]\", \"[[Where I Ought to Be]]\", and \"[[Optimistic (Skeeter Davis song)|Optimistic]]\".{{sfn|Whitburn|2006|p=135}}{{sfn|Davis|1993|pages=210–213}} \"(I Can't Help You) I'm Falling Too\" marked Davis's first entrance as a solo artist onto the Billboard [[Billboard Hot 100|pop charts]] in 1960{{sfn|Davis|1993|p=213}} and resulted in her being invited to perform on [[Dick Clark]]'s ''[[American Bandstand]]''.{{sfn|Davis|1993|p=224}} The song went all the way to the top 40, unheard of for a female country singer at the time. In 1961, she scored a second pop hit with a lyric version (written by Skeeter) of [[Floyd Cramer]]'s instrumental [[country pop]] smash \"[[Last Date (song)|Last Date]]\" called \"My Last Date (With You)\" which did even better, making the top 30 on the pop charts.  Both of these songs did exceptionally well on the [[Country music|country]] charts, peaking at number two and number five, respectively.\n\n===1963–1976: Crossover and critical accolades===\nIn 1963, Davis achieved her biggest success with country pop crossover hit \"[[The End of the World (Skeeter Davis song)|The End of the World]]\".<ref name=pc10>{{Gilliland |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19758/m1/ |title=Show 10 – Tennessee Firebird: American country music before and after Elvis.

The record was also a surprise top-five hit on the [[rhythm and blues]] charts, making Davis one of the few white female singers to have a top-10 hit in that market. The single sold over one million copies and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]].{{sfn|Murrells|1978|p=145}} \"The End of the World\" soon became Davis's signature song. Davis achieved one other country-pop hit with the [[Gerry Goffin]] and [[Carole King]]-penned \"[[I Can't Stay Mad at You]]\", which peaked at number seven on the pop charts and number two on the Easy Listening chart in 1963.{{sfn|Whitburn|2002|p=73}} In 1964, she was nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance]] for her recording of \"[[He Says the Same Things to Me]]\".<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Billboard|title=Finalists for 1964 Grammy Awards|page=6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aUUEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA6|date=March 20, 1965|volume=77|number=12|issn=0006-2510}}</ref>\n\nDavis's success continued with \"[[I'm Saving My Love]]\" and 1964's \"[[Gonna Get Along Without You Now]]\", an updated cover of a 1956 hit by [[Patience and Prudence]]. Both made the top 10 on the country charts and cracked the ''Billboard'' Top 50 pop charts, though the success of \"Gonna Get\" was likely hampered by another remake of the song by vocalist [[Tracey Dey]] simultaneously climbing the charts to peak slightly lower than Davis's version.  Later pop efforts, such as \"Let Me Get Close to You\" in July 1964, missed making the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]],{{sfn|Whitburn|2002|p=90}} reflecting the changing nature of pop styles due to the ongoing [[British invasion]]. In 1965, she recorded a duet with [[Bobby Bare]] called \"[[A Dear John Letter]]\", which just missed the country top 10.{{sfn|Whitburn|2002|p=90}} The following year, she earned her third Grammy nomination for \"[[Sun Glasses (song)|Sun Glasses]]\", which peaked at number 30 on the Hot Country Songs chart.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Billboard/60s/1965/Billboard%201965-10-16.pdf|title=Hot Country Singles|magazine=Billboard|date=October 16, 1965|page=56|volume=77|number=61|issn=0006-2510}}</ref>\n\nIn 1967, Davis was back in the top 10 with \"[[What Does It Take (To Keep a Man Like You Satisfied)]]\".
