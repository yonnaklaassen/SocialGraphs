She was often described as a [[country music|country]] singer, although, like [[Skeeter Davis]] (to whom she has been frequently compared),{{cn|date=July 2024}} her output varied. Later in her career, the term \"countrypolitan\", associated with the \"[[Nashville sound]]\", was sometimes applied.<ref name=\"darcy\">Michael D'Arcy [http://www.countrypolitan.com/fringe0601.php Countrypolitan] www.countrypolitan.com {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203191740/http://www.countrypolitan.com/fringe0601.php |date=February 3, 2007}}</ref> Posey had four hit singles in the [[United States]], three of which peaked at number 12 on the [[Hot 100]].<ref name=\":0\">Charlie Gillett & Simon Frith (1976) ''Rock File 4''</ref>\n\n==Early life and session singer career==\nPosey was born in [[Jasper, Alabama]], on June 18, 1944.<ref name=\":1\">Posey’s birth name has sometimes been cited mistakenly as Martha Sharp because Sharp wrote some of her early recordings: see, for example, Hugh Gregory (1993), ''Who's Who In Country Music''.</ref><ref>Some sources give 1947, but 1944 is more consistent with her having graduated from high school in 1962 and Posey herself has referred to her age as 21 at the time that \"Born a Woman\" was made in 1966: see sleeve notes for Sandy Posey's CD ''A Single Girl: The Very Best of the MGM Recordings'' (2002), which contains an extensive interview with Posey about her early career.</ref> She graduated from [[high school]] in [[West Memphis, Arkansas]], in 1962.<ref name=\":2\">See sleeve notes for ''A Single Girl'' (2002)</ref> Posey obtained work as a session singer after being recommended by an aunt to an acquaintance who worked in [[television]].\n\nIn addition to working as a [[receptionist]] at a studio in Memphis, she took part in recording sessions across the [[Deep South]], including sessions produced by [[Chips Moman|Lincoln \"Chips\" Moman]] for [[Elvis Presley]] and on [[Percy Sledge]]’s \"[[When a Man Loves a Woman (song)|When a Man Loves a Woman]]\" (a number one hit in the US in 1966). Other singers whom she backed included [[Joe Tex]], [[Bobby Goldsboro]] and [[Tommy Roe]].{{cn|date=July 2024}}\n\n==Solo career==\nPosey's first single, under the name '''Sandy Carmel''', was \"Kiss Me Goodnight\" (1965), written by William Cates, which was coupled with \"First Boy\". This was released by [[Bell Records (1950s-70s)|Bell Records]] but received minimal publicity and made little impact. Assisted by Gary Walker, a [[Music publisher (popular music)|music publisher]] who became her manager, Posey then made a [[Demo (music)|demonstration recording]] of \"Born a Woman\", written by Martha Sharp.<ref>Sharp made her own recordings of \"Born a Woman\" and \"Single Girl\" in 1973 for a Monument album (KZ 32234).</ref> According to Posey, Chips Moman \"went wild\" when he heard this and helped her to obtain a [[recording contract|contract]] with [[MGM Records|MGM]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]].<ref>Sleeve notes for ''A Single Girl'' CD (2002)</ref>\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Sandy Posey - Single Girl (2).jpg|thumb|140px|left|Sandy Posey, circa 1966 (cover of MGM single, \"[[Single Girl]]\")]] -->\n\n===\"Born a Woman\"===\nPosey had her first hit with \"Born a Woman\", which Moman produced in Nashville on March 15, 1966.<ref name=\"mgm\">{{cite web |url=http://geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Palladium/9229/sposey.htm |title=MGM home page |access-date=October 10, 2010 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091021031202/http://geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Palladium/9229/sposey.htm |archive-date=October 21, 2009 }}</ref>  This reached number 12 on the Hot 100 in August 1966.

The song was later covered by [[Nick Lowe]] ([[Bowi (EP)|Bowi]] EP) and [[Hubble Bubble]]. The song was later used by [[Rush Limbaugh]] for his “Feminist Update”.\n\n===\"Single Girl\"===\nPosey's next single release was \"[[Single Girl]]\", also written by Martha Sharp. Recorded in Nashville on August 19, 1966,<ref name=\"mgm\" /> this also reached number 12 in America in January 1967 and number 15 in [[Great Britain]], where it benefited from airplay on [[pirate radio]] (peaking, for example, at number 7 in [[Wonderful Radio London|Radio London]]'s non-sales-based Fab 40 on [[New Year's Day]], 1967<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiolondon.co.uk/xmas01/xfabs01/jan01/xfabforty010167.html |title=Field's Fab New Year - 1st January 1967 |publisher=Radio London |date=January 1, 1967 |access-date=August 19, 2015}}</ref>). It followed \"Born a Woman\" by selling in excess of one million copies.<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\"/> \"Single Girl\" was re-released in Britain in 1975 and reached the top 50 for a second time.<ref>''Guinness British Hit Singles'' (15th ed, 2002)</ref>\n\n===\"What a Woman in Love Won't Do\"===\nIn November 1966, \"What a Woman in Love Won't Do\" hit No. 31 on the Hot 100, while in the UK singles chart it peaked at No. 48.\n\n===Other work===\nPosey's final pop top 20 hit was \"[[I Take It Back]]\", another US number 12 in July 1967, although she made other recordings for [[MGM Records]] until 1968, including \"What a Woman in Love Won't Do\", which peaked at number 31 in the US in late 1967. These were mostly produced by Moman, but a few, including a version of [[The Shirelles]]' hit \"[[Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow]]\" (1968), were produced by [[Joe South]].\n\n===Country recordings===\nPosey turned to the country music field in 1971, signing with [[Columbia Records]] with [[Billy Sherrill]] as producer. Sherrill had just successfully turned another 1960s pop star, [[Jody Miller]], into a leading country female vocalist, and it appeared Posey might be another one when the first single, \"Bring Him Safely Home to Me\" hit the top 20. However, it was not to be, with only two other singles barely scraping into the top 40. Posey signed with [[Monument Records]] in 1976 with just one single charting and later in the year moved to [[Warner Bros. Records]]. Her first single for the label inauspiciously peaked at No.&nbsp;93, but in 1978 and 1979 she charted three top&nbsp;30 country hits before this brief comeback faded away with the new decade.\n\nPosey was occasionally recorded as a solo artist in the early 1980s, but she reverted to occasional background session work and later briefly performed as a background vocalist for [[Skeeter Davis]] on an international tour. She made a number of country recordings with a religious theme after embracing [[Christianity]] in 1974.<ref name=\"darcy\" /><ref>sleeve notes for ''A Single Girl'' CD, 2002</ref>\n\nIn 1983, Posey had another charted single on the country charts, titled \"Can't Get Used to Sleeping Without You\". In 2004, Posey recorded an album for King Records in Nashville, Tennessee. She subsequently signed with Crossworlds Entertainment of Lebanon, Tennessee. During 2007, Posey released several songs through Crossworlds Entertainment.{{cn|date=July 2024}}\n\n==Personal life and death==\nOn February 4, 1969, Posey married James \"Billy\" Buchanan Robinson Jr. The couple had one daughter, but they later divorced. Posey then married Elvis impersonator and Christian evangelist, \"Elvis\" Wade Cummins.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> Posey died from complications of dementia at her home
