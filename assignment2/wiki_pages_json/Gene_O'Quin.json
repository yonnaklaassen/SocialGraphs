His recording career reached its peak  between 1950 and 1955.\n\nO'Quin's voice was high and nasally and had a twang evocative of [[Little Jimmy Dickens]]. He cut many [[novelty songs]] and boogie-woogie records. The persona in his records was happy-go-lucky and well suited to [[hillbilly music]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Adams|first=Greg|title=Boogie Woogie Fever: Gene O'Quin|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/boogie-woogie-fever-r462277|publisher=All Music|accessdate=26 January 2012}}</ref> Although he did not record any [[rockabilly]] songs in his career, rockabilly enthusiasts have embraced him.
