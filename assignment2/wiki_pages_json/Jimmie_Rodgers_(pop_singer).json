Rodgers had a run of hits and mainstream popularity in the 1950s and 1960s. His string of crossover singles ranked highly on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Pop Singles]], [[Hot Country Songs|Hot Country and Western Sides]], and [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|Hot Rhythm and Blues Sides]] charts; in the 1960s, Rodgers had more modest successes with [[adult contemporary music]].\n\nHe was not related to country music pioneer [[Jimmie Rodgers|Jimmie C. Rodgers]] (1897–1933), who died the same year the younger Rodgers was born. Among country audiences, and in his official songwriting credits, the younger Rodgers, Jimmie Frederick, was often credited as '''Jimmie F. Rodgers''' to differentiate the two.\n\n==Career==\n===Early years===\nRodgers was born in [[Camas, Washington]].<ref name=\"auto4\">Wayne Harada. \"Spotlighted Singer.\" ''Honolulu Advertiser'', September 15, 1957, p. 36.</ref>  He was the second son of Archie and Mary Rodgers.<ref name=\"auto2\">John Vergara, \"Oh, Oh, He's Done It Again.\" ''New York Daily News'', April 27, 1958, p.

Although he loved music, he was uncertain whether he could turn it into a career. He was subsequently drafted and served in the United States Air Force during the Korean War.<ref name=\"auto\">Dick Kleiner. \"Honeycomb Started Here.\" ''(Nashville) The Tennessean'', November 3, 1957, p. 7C.</ref>\n\n=== 1950s ===\nWhile in the Air Force, Rodgers joined a band named The Melodies started by violinist Phil Clark.

His biggest hit of the decade in the UK was \"English Country Garden\", a version of the folk song \"[[Country Gardens]]\", which reached number 5 in the chart in June 1962.<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\" />  In 1962, he moved to the [[Dot Records|Dot]] label, and four years later to [[A&M Records]]. He also appeared in some films, including ''[[The Little Shepherd of Kingdom Come (1961 film)|The Little Shepherd of Kingdom Come]]'' and ''[[Back Door to Hell]]'', which he helped finance.\n\nIn 1966, a long dry spell ended for Rodgers when he re-entered the Top 40 with \"[[It's Over (Jimmie Rodgers song)|It's Over]]\" (later to be recorded by [[Eddy Arnold]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Glen Campbell]], [[Mason Williams]], [[Scott Walker (singer)|Scott Walker]], and [[Sonny James]]).

Meanwhile, his voice was still being heard: Several of his earlier hits were used in jingles in the 1970s, one for [[SpaghettiOs]] and another for [[Honeycomb (cereal)|Honeycomb]] breakfast cereal.<ref name=\"auto3\" /> And Rodgers' songs continued to make the ''Billboard'' Country and Easy Listening charts until 1979.
