He was the son of John Philip Poole and Elizabeth Johnson. In 1918, he moved to the town of Spray, [[North Carolina]], now part of [[Eden, North Carolina|Eden]]. As a child, he learned to play the [[banjo]].<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> He played [[baseball]], and his three-fingered technique was the result of an accident.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> Whilst betting that he could catch a baseball without a glove, the ball broke his thumb as he closed his hand too soon, resulting in a permanent arch in his right hand.\n\nPoole bought his first banjo, an Orpheum No. 3 Special, with profits from making [[moonshine]]. He later appeared in the 1929 [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson Company]] catalog to promote their banjo.\n\nHe spent much of his adult life working in [[textile mills]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2022}}\n\n=== The North Carolina Ramblers ===\n[[File:MilwaukeeBlues.ogg|thumb|Milwaukee Blues]]\nPoole and his brother-in-law, fiddle player [[Posey Rorer]], whom he had met in [[West Virginia]] in 1917 and whose sister he married, formed a trio with guitarist Norman Woodlief<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\" /> called the North Carolina Ramblers.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\" /> They auditioned in [[New York (state)|New York]] for [[Columbia Records]].<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\" /> After signing a contract, they recorded \"Don't Let Your Deal Go Down Blues\" on July 27 1925.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\" /> This song was successful, selling over 106,000 copies at a time when there were estimated to be only 6,000 [[phonograph]]s in the southern [[United States]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2022}}, according to Poole's biographer and great-nephew, Kinney Rorrer. The band was paid $75 for the session.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Rorrer |first=Kinney |date=2015 |title=The North Carolina Rambler: Charlie Poole |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/26341083 |journal=Appalachian Journal |volume=42 |issue=3/4 |pages=255 |jstor=26341083 |via=JSTOR}}</ref>\n\nFor the next five years, Poole and the Ramblers were a popular band.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> The band's sound remained consistent, although several members came and left (including Posey Rorer and Norm Woodlief).<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> The band recorded over 60 songs for Columbia Records during the 1920s, including \"Sweet Sunny South\", \"White House Blues\", \"He Rambled\", and \"Take a Drink on Me\". Former [[railroad engineer]] [[Roy Harvey (musician)|Roy Harvey]] was one of the [[Guitarist|guitarists]].<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> [[Fiddle|Fiddlers]] in various recording sessions were Posey Rorer, Lonnie Austin and Odell Smith.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/>\n\n[[Bill C. Malone]], in his history of country music, ''Country Music, U.S.A.'', says, \"The Rambler sound was predictable: a bluesy fiddle lead, backed up by long, flowing, melodic guitar runs and the finger-style banjo picking of Poole. Predictable as it may be, it was nonetheless outstanding. No string band in early country music equaled the Ramblers' controlled, clean, well-patterned sound.\"<ref>''Country Music, U.S.A.'', Bill C. Malone, [[University of Texas Press]], 2002</ref>\n\nPoole composed few of his recordings, mostly covering old folk songs. Nevertheless, his dynamic renditions were popular with a broad audience in the Southeast United States. He is considered a primary source for [[old-time music]] revivalists and aficionados. Songs like \"Bill Morgan and His Gal\", \"Milwaukee Blues\", and \"Leavin' Home\", have been resurrected by banjo players. Poole developed a unique fingerpicking style, a blend of melody, arpeggio, and rhythm (distinct from [[Clawhammer|clawhammer/ frailing]] and [[Earl Scruggs|Scruggs]]' variations).<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/>\n\nPoole had been invited to [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]] to play background music for a film, but died before this could happen in May 1931.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> His cause of death was a heart attack due to alcohol poisoning.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> According to some reports, he had been disheartened by the slump in record sales due to the [[Great Depression|Depression]].\n\n==Legacy==\nPoole's music saw a revival in the 1960s, most likely due to his inclusion on the 1952 ''[[Anthology of American Folk Music]]'', and his renditions have been re-recorded by numerous artists, such as [[John Mellencamp]] with \"White House Blues\", [[The Chieftains]], [[New Lost City Ramblers]], [[Holy Modal Rounders]] and [[Hot Tuna]] with \"Hesitation Blues\", and [[Joan Baez]] with \"Sweet Sunny South\". The [[Grateful Dead]]'s popular song \"Deal\" was influenced by \"Don't Let Your Deal Go Down\".{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} His recordings have also appeared on numerous compilations of [[old-time music]]. Since 1995, Poole's legacy has been carried on every year in Eden, North Carolina, during the month of June when the Piedmont Folk Legacies, Inc, a non-profit organization, hosts the Charlie Poole Music Festival. [[Bob Dylan]] in his [[Nobel Lecture]] acknowledged Poole and several lyrics of his song \"You Ain't Talkin To Me\".<ref>{{cite speech |last=Dylan |first=Bob |title=Bob Dylan—Nobel Lecture |date=June 4, 2017 |location=Los Angeles, CA |publisher=The Nobel Foundation |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/2016/dylan-lecture.html |access-date=October 4, 2017}}</ref>\n\nColumbia issued a three-CD box set of his music, entitled ''You Ain't Talkin' to Me: Charlie Poole and the Roots of Country Music'' in 2005. The album, produced by Henry \"Hank\" Sapoznik, was nominated for three [[Grammy Award]]s. It chronicles the music made for [[Columbia Records|Columbia]] by Poole and the North Carolina Ramblers between 1925 and 1931, including such important songs as \"Don't Let Your Deal Go Down\", \"Can I Sleep in Your Barn Tonight, Mister?\", \"Old and Only in the Way\" (the title of which was used by Jerry Garcia to name his 1970s bluegrass band with [[David Grisman]], Old and in the Way), and \"White House Blues\", adapted by John Mellencamp, who in 2004 updated the politically charged lyrics and changed the title to \"To Washington\". In addition to 43 of Poole's original recordings, the package features performances by other early roots music players and singers, including [[Fred Van Eps]], [[Arthur Collins (singer)|Arthur Collins]], [[Billy Murray (singer)|Billy Murray]], Floyd Country Ramblers, [[Uncle Dave Macon]] and [[The Red Fox Chasers]].\n\nThe original liner notes, by [[Peter Stampfel]], state, \"Charlie Poole and the North Carolina Ramblers recorded an incredible number of songs that are personal favorites of mine. Poole is, in fact, one of the great musicians of the century. No doubt about it.\" The album's cover art was created by [[Robert Crumb]], the celebrated illustrator and an old-time music aficionado.\n\nKinney Rorer penned a biography of Charlie Poole, entitled ''Ramblin' Blues: The Life and Songs of Charlie Poole'' in 1982. Rorer is a descendant of Poole's fiddler Posey Rorer, and is the banjo player for the old-time music group The New North Carolina Ramblers.\n\nA double-CD album paying tribute to Poole was released by singer-songwriter [[Loudon Wainwright III]] in August 2009. The album, entitled ''[[High Wide & Handsome: The Charlie Poole Project]]'', features 30 tracks, including new versions of songs originally recorded by Poole, as well as tunes composed by Wainwright and producer Dick Connette on the artist's life and times; it was awarded the [[Grammy Award for Best Traditional Folk Album]] at the [[52nd Annual Grammy Awards]].\n\n==Discography==\n{| class=wikitable\n!
