He partnered with Dwight Rucker in 1982 to form the country music duo Malchak & Rucker. Together, they became the first black/white duo in country music history with a single, \"Just Like That\" to chart. It debuted on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs|Hot Country Singles & Tracks]] chart in 1984.\n\nWhen the duo disbanded in 1986, Malchak launched a solo career. Alpine Records released his debut album, ''Colorado Moon'', in 1987 and its title track became his first Top 40 single. His second Top 40 single, the self-penned, \"Restless Angel\" followed as part of his next album, ''American Man''. \n\nIt was released in 1988. The album's second single, \"It Goes Without Saying,\" was his highest-charting single on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart, peaking at No.&nbsp;35. Malchak then signed with [[Jimmy Bowen]]'s [[Universal Music Group|Universal Records]] for the release of his third album, ''Different Circles''. In 1989, Malchak was slated to be a nominee for the [[Academy of Country Music Award for New Male Artist of the Year]], but he didn't make the final five.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.worldradiohistory.com/Archive-All-Music/Billboard/80s/1989/BB-1989-03-04.pdf|title=Slew Of Stars Vie For ACM Awards|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|pages=42|date=March 4, 1989}}</ref>\n\nAfter the album failed to produce any Top 40 singles, Malchak moved to [[South Carolina]] in 1992. In 2001, he released his first [[Christian music|Christian]] album, ''Pathway to Glory'', on his own Parable Records. Later in the year, he launched Tim Malchak Ministries.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Collins |first1=Stacey |title=Singer Tim Malchak talks about his life and music |url=https://www.islandpacket.com/2011/03/28/1599794/singer-tim-malchak-talks-about.html |website=islandpacket |access-date=7 September 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110731125108/http://www.islandpacket.com/2011/03/28/1599794/singer-tim-malchak-talks-about.html |archive-date=31 July 2011}}</ref> As of 2017, Malchak has released twelve Christian albums.
