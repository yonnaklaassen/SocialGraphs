He established the Terlingua North Chili Cook-Off and Music Festival there, where now-popular acts like [[Pat Green]] and [[Cross Canadian Ragweed]] played early in their careers. \"It seems every time we had a young and upcoming band up there, it was like they hit a diving board and just sprung into the air,\" Nunn notes. And within today's thriving Texas and [[Red Dirt (music)|Red Dirt]] scene, he's a revered elder statesman to countless performers and songwriters who teethed and grew up on his music. \"They’ve let me know I inspired them and showed them how it could be done.\"<ref name=\"floores\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.liveatfloores.com/event/345355/|website=John T.
