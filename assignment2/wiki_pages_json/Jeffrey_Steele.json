Along with recording his own material, Steele has become a prolific Nashville songwriter, having co-written more than 60 hit songs for such artists as [[Montgomery Gentry]], [[Tim McGraw]], [[Faith Hill]], [[LeAnn Rimes]], [[Rascal Flatts]], [[Billy Ray Cyrus]], and others.\n\nBetween 1990 and 1996, Steele was the lead singer and bass guitarist in the country music band [[Boy Howdy]], which recorded two albums and an [[Extended play|EP]] on [[Curb Records]], in addition to charting seven singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country music charts. After Boy Howdy disbanded, Steele embarked on a solo career, recording seven studio albums (one of which was not released). He also charted four singles as a solo artist, with the highest-peaking (\"Somethin' in the Water\") reaching No.&nbsp;33 on the country charts in 2001.\n\n==Biography==\nJeffrey LeVasseur was born in [[Burbank, California]] to a musical family. His mother was a singer, and his father had aspirations to become a country music songwriter.<ref name=\"cmt\"/> He first gained his own interest in music at age eight, when he sang [[Three Dog Night]]'s \"[[Joy to the World (Three Dog Night song)|Joy to the World]]\" at a church function. This rendition earned him a standing ovation, so he sang the song an additional seven times.<ref name=\"cmt\"/><ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p206695/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=allmusic (((Jeffrey Steele > Biography))) |access-date=July 21, 2007 |work=Allmusic}}</ref> Later, he shifted his focus to songwriting. By age 17, he was performing with local groups, and playing keyboards at various gigs on the [[Sunset Strip]] in Los Angeles.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> In 1987, after the death of his father, LeVasseur changed his last name to Steele as a tribute to his father, who processed steel for a living.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nu.musiccitynetworks.com/index.htm?id=7285&sid=3042 |title=Jeffrey Steele |access-date=July 21, 2007 |work=Nashville Underground |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927041300/http://nu.musiccitynetworks.com/index.htm?id=7285&sid=3042 |archive-date=September 27, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n==Boy Howdy==\n{{main|Boy Howdy}}\nIn 1990, Steele and three other California musicians – Hugh Wright, along with brothers Cary and Larry Park – formed the band [[Boy Howdy]], in which he served as lead vocalist and bass guitarist.<ref name=\"allmusic2\">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p26222/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=allmusic (((Boy Howdy > Biography))) |access-date=July 21, 2007 |work=Allmusic}}</ref> Jeffrey Steele wrote a song, 'When Johnny Comes Marching Home' about the returning veterans from the Gulf war, Curb signed Boy Howdy but made them change their group name to 'New Frontier'  they went to appear on 'Nashville Now'  hosted by Ralph Emery who liked the band name Boy Howdy this helped convince Curb records to let them keep the Boy Howdy name.  The war ended so soon that the single was never released. Boy Howdy signed to [[Curb Records]] in 1992, recording three albums and an [[extended play]] for the label, in addition to charting seven singles on the country music charts.<ref name=\"allmusic2\"/> While in Boy Howdy, Steele was named Best Bassist and Best Male Vocalist by the California Country Music Association.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> As the band's primary songwriter, he also earned [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]] awards for co-writing their highest-charting singles, \"[[She'd Give Anything (song)|She'd Give Anything]]\" and \"[[They Don't Make 'Em Like That Anymore]]\".<ref name=\"allmusic\"/>\n\n==Solo career and success as songwriter==\nSteele re-located to [[Nashville, Tennessee]] in 1994, two years before Boy Howdy disbanded. In 1996, he released three solo singles, as well as a self-titled solo album which was never shipped.<ref name=\"bmi1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.bmi.com/musicworld/entry/233539 |title=Jeffrey Steele |access-date=July 21, 2007 |work=BMI.com|date=February 28, 2001 }}</ref><ref name=\"allmusic\"/> Steele was eventually signed to a songwriting contract, however, and he began writing singles for other artists. Among his first hits as a songwriter were \"[[If You Love Somebody]]\" by [[Kevin Sharp (country singer)|Kevin Sharp]], \"[[Unbelievable (Diamond Rio song)|Unbelievable]]\" by [[Diamond Rio]], and \"[[Big Deal (LeAnn Rimes song)|Big Deal]]\" by [[LeAnn Rimes]], all three of which earned him additional BMI awards.<ref name=\"bmi1\"/><ref name=\"allmusic\"/> He also sang backing vocals on Sharp's first two albums.\n\nIn 2001, Steele was signed to his second solo recording contract, this time with [[Monument Records]]. His solo debut album, ''Somethin' in the Water'', was issued late that year. In addition to producing the album, Steele wrote or co-wrote every song on it.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> The album's title cut reached a peak of No.&nbsp;33 on the [[Hot Country Singles & Tracks]] chart, becoming Steele's only Top 40 hit as a solo artist.\n\nMeanwhile, he continued to write songs for other artists, with [[Faith Hill]], [[Tim McGraw]], [[Trace Adkins]], and [[Montgomery Gentry]] all recording songs he had co-written.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> Steele earned his first Number One song with [[Tim McGraw]]'s \"[[The Cowboy in Me]]\" in 2002. In addition, [[Rascal Flatts]] reached Number One on the country charts in late 2002 with \"[[These Days (Rascal Flatts song)|These Days]]\", their first Number One single. Steele also continued to record studio albums even while writing hits for other artists; his albums ''Gold, Platinum, Chrome and Steele'' and ''You Gotta Start Somewhere'' were both released in 2003, the same year that he was named Songwriter of the Year by both BMI and the Nashville Songwriters Association International (NSAI).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://songwriter101.com/articles/716_0_6_0_M/ |title=Jeffrey Steele, Jesse Harris, Butch Walker, & Pat Green: Songwriters on Songwriting |access-date=July 21, 2007 |work=Songwriter101.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927211358/http://songwriter101.com/articles/716_0_6_0_M/ |archive-date=September 27, 2007 }}</ref><ref name=\"find\">{{cite news |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/nashville/stories/2005/10/17/daily2.html |title=Jeffrey Steele named Songwriter of the Year by NSAI |access-date=July 21, 2007 |work=FindArticles.com |date=October 17, 2005}}</ref> 2004 saw the release of his fourth studio album, ''Outlaw'', on the [[Lofton Creek Records]] label.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bmi.com/news/entry/234206 |title=Jeffrey Steele Anticipates Arrival of \"Outlaw\" |access-date=July 21, 2007 |work=bmi.com|date=October 7, 2004 }}</ref> By 2005, more than sixty of his songs had become chart hits for other artists;<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> that same year, he received a second Songwriter of the Year award from the NSAI.<ref name=\"find\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1511639/20051017/steele_jeffrey.jhtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930044156/http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1511639/20051017/steele_jeffrey.jhtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 30, 2007 |title=Five Members Welcomed to Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame |access-date=July 21, 2007 |work=CMT.com}}</ref>\n\nHis most successful single as a songwriter is \"[[What Hurts the Most]]\", co-written with English songwriter [[Steve Robson]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/steve-robson/5638 |title=Steve Robson page at Grammy.com |access-date=May 11, 2021}}</ref>  The song was a Number One single on both the [[Hot Country Songs]] and [[Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks]] charts for [[Rascal Flatts]] in 2006, and was also a chart single for [[Cascada]] in 2007.
