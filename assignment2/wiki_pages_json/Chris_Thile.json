When he was two, his family started going to That Pizza Place, where he listened to John Moore's band Bluegrass Etc. When Thile was four, his family moved to [[Idyllwild, California]].\n\nThile began playing the mandolin at the age of five, taking occasional lessons from John Moore. At age eight, Thile's family and the Watkins family formed [[Nickel Creek]]. The band performed at many California bluegrass festivals, and as a result Chris had to be [[homeschooling|home-schooled]]. At age twelve, he won the mandolin championship at the [[Walnut Valley Festival]] in [[Winfield, Kansas]].\n\nThat same year, 1993, Thile made a demo tape and sent it to the Sugar Hill and Rounder record labels. Both labels showed interest, but the Thiles went with Sugar Hill.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ibluegrass.com/bg_posting3.CFM?p__i=426&p__r=&p__a=inter | title = Chris Thile: Covering the Bases | publisher = iBluegrass.com | date = May 20, 1999 | access-date = 2007-08-30 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071121182607/http://www.ibluegrass.com/bg_posting3.CFM?p__i=426&p__r=&p__a=inter | archive-date = November 21, 2007 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> The next year, Chris Thile released his first solo album, ''[[Leading Off]]'', featuring mostly original compositions.\n\nIn 1995, the Thile family moved to [[Murray, Kentucky]], where Chris' father Scott Thile accepted a position at [[Murray State University]] as a musical instrument technician.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.waynerice.com/bgbios/bgbiosn.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141214081710/http://waynerice.com/bgbios/bgbiosn.htm |archive-date=December 14, 2014 |title=N}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://campus.murraystate.edu/staff/scott.thile/index.html|title=Scott E.

We had gotten to play together a few days before and we had said that we needed to do something musical together. With our hearts smashed to pieces, it became more urgent – our lives had gone the same way for so long. I knew I wanted to have a band with Gabe [Witcher], but I didn't know if it would be a rock ensemble, an ambitious acoustic classical thing or a bluegrass group. We played, and there was a serious, instantaneous connection.
