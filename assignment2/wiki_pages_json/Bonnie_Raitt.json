Following this, she released a series of critically acclaimed [[Americana (music)|roots]]-influenced albums that incorporated elements of [[blues]], [[rock music|rock]], [[Folk music|folk]], and [[Country music|country]]. She was also a frequent session player and collaborator with other artists, including [[Warren Zevon]], [[Little Feat]], [[Jackson Browne]], [[the Pointer Sisters]], [[John Prine]], and [[Leon Russell]].\n\nIn 1989, after several years of limited commercial success, she had a major hit with her tenth studio album,  ''[[Nick of Time (album)|Nick of Time]]'', which included the [[Nick of Time (song)|song of the same name]].

Her following two albums, ''[[Luck of the Draw (album)|Luck of the Draw]]'' (1991) and ''[[Longing in Their Hearts]]'' (1994), were multimillion sellers, generating several hit singles, including \"[[Something to Talk About (Bonnie Raitt song)|Something to Talk About]]\", \"[[Love Sneakin' Up On You]]\", and the ballad \"[[I Can't Make You Love Me]]\" (with [[Bruce Hornsby]] on piano).

Hammond|John Hammond]] at [[the Gaslight Cafe]] in New York. She was seen by a reporter from ''[[Newsweek]]'', who began to spread the word about her performance. Scouts from major record companies were soon attending her shows to watch her play. She eventually accepted an offer from [[Warner Bros.]], who soon released her debut album, ''[[Bonnie Raitt (album)|Bonnie Raitt]]'', in 1971.<ref name=\"LarkinBlues\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Blues]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1995|edition=Second|isbn=0-85112-673-1|page=300}}</ref> The album was warmly received by the music press, with many writers praising her skills as an interpreter and as a bottleneck guitarist; at the time, few women in popular music had strong reputations as guitarists.\n\nWhile admired by those who saw her perform, and respected by her peers, Raitt gained little public acclaim for her work. Her critical stature continued to grow but record sales remained modest. Her second album, ''[[Give It Up (Bonnie Raitt album)|Give It Up]]'', was released in 1972 to positive reviews.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Erlewine |first1=Stephen Thomas |title=Bonnie Raiit: Give It Up |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/give-it-up-mw0000196849 |website=AllMusic |access-date=24 January 2019}}</ref> One journalist described the album as \"an excellent set\" and \"established the artist as an inventive and sympathetic interpreter\".<ref name=\"LarkinBlues\"/> However, it did not change her commercial fortunes. 1973's ''[[Takin' My Time]]'' was also met with critical acclaim, but these notices were not matched by the sales.<ref name=\"LarkinBlues\"/>\n\nRaitt began to receive greater press coverage, including a 1975 cover story for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', but with 1974's ''[[Streetlights (Bonnie Raitt album)|Streetlights]]'', reviews for her work were becoming increasingly mixed.<ref name=\"LarkinBlues\"/> By this point, Raitt was already experimenting with different producers and different styles, and she began to adopt a more mainstream sound that continued through 1975's ''[[Home Plate (album)|Home Plate]]''. In 1976, Raitt made an appearance on [[Warren Zevon]]'s [[Warren Zevon (album)|eponymous album]].\n\nShe was influenced by the playing style of [[Lowell George]], of the band [[Little Feat]], particularly his use of a pre-amp [[Dynamic range compression|compressor]] with a [[slide guitar]].

However, the song's commercial success prompted a bidding war for Raitt between [[Warner Bros.]] and [[Columbia Records]]. \"There was this big Columbia–Warner war going on at the time\", recalled Raitt in a 1990 interview. \"[[James Taylor]] had just left Warner Bros. and made a big album for Columbia... And then, Warner signed [[Paul Simon]] away from Columbia, and they didn't want me to have a hit record for Columbia – no matter what! So, I renegotiated my contract, and they basically matched Columbia's offer. Frankly the deal was a really big deal.\"{{sfn|Bego|1995|p=76}}\n\nWarner Brothers held higher expectations for Raitt's next album, ''[[The Glow (Bonnie Raitt album)|The Glow]]'', in 1979, but it was released to poor reviews as well as modest sales.<ref name=\"LarkinBlues\"/> Raitt had one commercial success in 1979 when she helped organize the five concerts of [[Musicians United for Safe Energy]] (MUSE) at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York City. Those shows spawned the three-record gold album ''[[No Nukes (album)|No Nukes]]'', as well as a Warner Brothers feature film [[No Nukes (film)|of the same name]], and featured co-founders [[Jackson Browne]], [[Graham Nash]], [[John Hall (New York)|John Hall]], and Raitt as well as [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]], [[the Doobie Brothers]], [[Carly Simon]], [[James Taylor]], [[Gil Scott-Heron]], and others.\n\nIn 1980, she appeared as herself in the [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] film ''[[Urban Cowboy]]'' where she sang \"Don't It Make You Wanna Dance\".\n\nFor her next record, 1982's ''[[Green Light (Bonnie Raitt album)|Green Light]]'', Raitt made a conscious attempt to revisit the sound of her earlier records. However, to her surprise, many of her peers and the media compared her new sound to the burgeoning [[New wave music|new wave]] movement. The album received her strongest reviews in years, but her sales did not improve and this had a severe impact on her relationship with Warner Brothers.<ref name=\"LarkinBlues\"/>\n\n====''Tongue and Groove'' and release from Warner Brothers====\nIn 1983, Raitt was finishing work on her follow-up album, ''Tongue and Groove''. The day after mastering was completed on ''Tongue & Groove'', the record company dropped Raitt from its roster, not being happy with her commercial performance up to that point.<ref name=\"LarkinBlues\"/> The album was shelved and not released, and Raitt was left without a record contract. At this time Raitt was also struggling with alcohol and drug abuse problems.<ref name=\"notbroken\">{{cite news |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bonnie-raitt-will-not-be-broken/ |title=Bonnie Raitt Will Not Be Broken |work=[[CBS News]] |last=Benjamin |first=Scott |date=February 18, 2009 |access-date=2012-04-13 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422171711/http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-3445_162-1209936.html |archive-date=April 22, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nDespite her personal and professional problems, Raitt continued to tour and participate in political activism. In 1985, she sang and appeared in the video of \"[[Sun City (song)|Sun City]]\", the anti-[[apartheid]] song written and produced by guitarist [[Steven Van Zandt]]. Along with her participation in [[Farm Aid]] and [[Amnesty International]] concerts, Raitt traveled to [[Moscow, Russia]] in 1987 to participate in the first joint Soviet/American Peace Concert, later shown on the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] cable network. Also in 1987, Raitt organized a benefit in [[Los Angeles]] for Countdown '87 to Stop [[Contras|Contra]] Aid. The benefit featured herself, along with [[Don Henley]], [[Herbie Hancock]], and others.\n\nTwo years after Warner Brothers Records dropped Raitt from their label, they notified her of their plans to release the ''Tongue and Groove'' album. \"I said it wasn't really fair,\" recalled Raitt. \"I think at this point they felt kind of bad. I mean, I was out there touring on my savings to keep my name up, and my ability to draw was less and less. So they agreed to let me go in and recut half of it, and that's when it came out as ''[[Nine Lives (Bonnie Raitt album)|Nine Lives]]''.\" That album, released in 1986 to critical and commercial disappointment, was Raitt's last new recording for Warner Brothers.<ref name=\"LarkinBlues\"/>\n\nIn late 1987, Raitt joined singers [[k.d. lang]] and [[Jennifer Warnes]] as background vocalists for [[Roy Orbison]]'s television special, ''[[Roy Orbison and Friends, A Black and White Night]]''. Following this highly acclaimed broadcast, Raitt began working on new material. By then, she was clean and sober, having resolved her problems with substance abuse.

During this time, Raitt considered signing with the [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]-owned [[Paisley Park|Paisley Park Records]], but they could not come to an agreement and negotiations fell through. Instead, she began recording a bluesy mix of pop and rock songs under the production guidance of [[Don Was]] at [[Capitol Records]].<ref name=\"LarkinBlues\"/>\n\nRaitt had met Was through [[Hal Willner]], who was putting together ''[[Stay Awake: Various Interpretations of Music from Vintage Disney Films|Stay Awake]]'', a tribute album to [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] music for [[A&M Records|A&M]]. Was and Willner both wanted Raitt to sing lead on an adult-contemporary arrangement created by Was for \"[[Baby Mine (song)|Baby Mine]]\", the lullaby from ''[[Dumbo]]''. Raitt was very pleased with the sessions, and she asked Was to produce her next album.\n\n===1989–1999: Commercial breakthrough===\n[[Image:Bonnie Raitt.jpg|thumb|200px|Raitt at the 1990 [[Grammy Awards]]]]\nAfter working with Was on the ''Stay Awake'' album, Raitt's management, Gold Mountain, approached numerous labels about a new record deal and found interest from [[Capitol Records]].<ref name=\"LarkinBlues\"/> Raitt was signed to Capitol by A&R executive [[Tim Devine]].
