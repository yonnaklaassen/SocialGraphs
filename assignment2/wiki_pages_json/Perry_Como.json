Practicing on his father, he mastered the skills well enough to have his own shop at age 14.{{sfn|Macfarlane|2009|p=11}}{{sfn|Grudens|2004|pp=63–69}} One of Como's regular customers at the barber shop owned a Greek coffeehouse that included a barber shop area, and asked Como whether he would like to take over that portion of his shop. Como had so much work after moving to the coffeehouse, he had to hire two barbers to help. His customers worked mainly at the nearby steel mills. They were well-paid, did not mind spending money on themselves, and enjoyed Como's song renditions. He did especially well when one of his customers would marry. The groom and his men would avail themselves of every treatment Como and his assistants had to offer. Como sang romantic songs while busying himself with the groom as the other two barbers worked with the rest of the groom's party. During the wedding preparation, the groom's friends and relatives would come into the shop with gifts of money for Como. He became so popular as a \"wedding barber\" in the Greek community that he was asked to provide his services in Pittsburgh and throughout Ohio.<ref name=Story2/>\n\n==Singing career==\n\n===Freddy Carlone and Ted Weems===\nIn 1932, Como left Canonsburg, moving about 100 miles away to [[Meadville, Pennsylvania]], where his uncle had a barber shop in the [[Conneaut Lake Park|Hotel Conneaut]]. About 80 miles from Cleveland, it was a popular stop on the itinerary for dance bands who worked up and down the Ohio Valley. Como, his girlfriend Roselle, and their friends had gone to nearby Cleveland; their good times took them to the Silver Slipper Ballroom, where Freddy Carlone and his orchestra were playing. Carlone invited anyone who thought he might have talent to come up and sing with his band. Como was terrified, but his friends urged him and pushed him onto the stage. Carlone was so impressed with Como's performance that he immediately offered him a job.<ref name = \"Perry\"/>\n\nComo was not certain if he should accept Carlone's offer, so he returned to Canonsburg to talk the matter over with his father. Como expected his father would tell him to stay in the barber business, but to his surprise, his father said if he did not take the opportunity, he might never know whether or not he could be a professional singer.<ref name = \"Perry\"/> The decision was also made with an eye on finances; at this time, Como was earning around $125 per week from his barber shop, while the job with Carlone paid $28 per week.<ref name=\"Turns Down\">{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8h0fAAAAIBAJ&pg=7237,2740891&dq=perry+como&hl=en|title=Perry Como Turns Down $250,000 A Year To Relax |date=January 25, 1955 |page=9 |last=Boyle |first=Hal |newspaper=The Tuscaloosa News |access-date=May 4, 2010}}</ref> Roselle was willing to travel with her fiancé and the band, but the salary was not enough to support two people on the road.{{sfn|Macfarlane|2009|p=14}} Perry and Roselle were married in Meadville on July 31, 1933; four days later, Como joined Carlone's band and began working with them.<ref name=\"Relaxation\">{{cite news |last1=Shapiro |first1=Stephanie |title=Chairman of the Leisure Board's Fine: Pop music: After 59 years in the business, Perry Como isn't about to retire.

That celebrated ease of his has been too little understood. Ease in any art is the result of mastery over the details of the craft. You get them together to the point where you can forget about how you do things and concentrate on what you are doing. Como got them together so completely that the muscles don't even show. It seems effortless, but a good deal of effort has gone into making it seem so. Como is known to be meticulous about rehearsal of the material for an album. He tries things out in different keys, gives the song thought, makes suggestions, tries it again, and again, until he is satisfied. The hidden work makes him look like Mr. Casual, and too many people are taken in by it—but happily so.\n\n—Gene Lees, sleeve note, ''Look To Your Heart''\n</blockquote>\n\n==Film career==\n[[File:Como fox publicity photo.JPG|thumb|upright|Fox publicity photo of Perry Como]]\nComo's Hollywood-type good looks earned him a seven-year contract with [[20th Century-Fox]] in 1943.
