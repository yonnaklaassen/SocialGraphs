Orbison's music is mostly in the [[rock music]] genre and his most successful periods were in the early 1960s and the late 1980s. He was nicknamed \"The [[Enrico Caruso|Caruso]] of Rock\" and \"The Big&nbsp;O\". Many of Orbison's songs conveyed vulnerability at a time when most male rock-and-roll performers projected [[machismo]]. He performed with minimal motion and in black clothes, matching his dyed black hair and dark [[sunglasses]].\n\nBorn in Texas, Orbison began singing in a [[Country music|country-and-western]] band as a teenager. He was signed by [[Sam Phillips]] of [[Sun Records]] in 1956 after \n[[Johnny Cash]] urged him to go to [[Sun Records|Sun]]. [[Elvis]] was leaving Sun and Phillips was looking to replace him. His first [[Sun]] recording, [[Ooby Dooby]] was a direct musical sound-a-like of Elvis's early Sun recordings. He had some success at [[Sun]] but enjoyed his greatest success with [[Monument Records]]. From 1960 to 1966, 22 of Orbison's singles reached the ''Billboard'' Top 40. He wrote or {{Nowrap|co-wrote}} almost all of his own Top 10 hits, including \"[[Only the Lonely]]\" (1960), \"[[Running Scared (Roy Orbison song)|Running Scared]]\" (1961), \"[[Crying (Roy Orbison song)|Crying]]\" (1961), \"[[In Dreams (Roy Orbison song)|In Dreams]]\" (1963), and \"[[Oh, Pretty Woman]]\" (1964).\n\nAfter the mid-1960s Orbison suffered a number of personal tragedies, and his career faltered. He experienced a resurgence in popularity in the 1980s, following the success of several cover versions of his songs. In 1988, he {{Nowrap|co-founded}} the [[Traveling Wilburys]] supergroup with [[George Harrison]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Tom Petty]], and [[Jeff Lynne]]. Orbison died of a heart attack that December at age 52. One month later, his song \"[[You Got It]]\" (1989) was released as a solo single, becoming his first hit to reach both the US and UK Top 10 in nearly 25 years.\n\nOrbison's honors include inductions into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] and [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 1987, the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 1989, and the [[Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum]] in 2014. He received a [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] and five other Grammy Awards. ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]'' placed him at number 37 on its list of the \"Greatest Artists of All Time\" and number 13 on its list of the \"100 Greatest Singers of All Time\". In 2002, ''Billboard'' magazine listed him at number 74 on its list of the Top 600 recording artists.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Early life==\nOrbison was born on April 23, 1936, in [[Vernon, Texas]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Orbison |first=Roy Jr. |title=The Authorized Roy Orbison|publisher=Center Street|others=Wesley Orbison, Alex Orbison, Jeff Slate|date=2017|isbn=978-1-4789-7654-7|edition=first|location=New York|page=27|oclc=1017566749}}</ref> He was the second of three sons born to Orbie Lee Orbison (1913–1984) and Nadine Vesta Shults (1914–1992).

He also enjoyed [[Hank Williams]], [[Bob Wills]], [[Moon Mullican]] and [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]]. One of the first musicians that he heard in person was [[Ernest Tubb]], playing on the back of a truck in Fort Worth. Orbison also said that a formative experience was the regular singing sessions at Fort Worth, where he was surrounded by soldiers who were intensely emotional because they were about to be sent to the front line in World War II. In West Texas, he was exposed to [[rhythm and blues]], [[western swing]], [[Tejano music|Tex-Mex]], the orchestral arrangements of [[Mantovani]], and Cajun music.

Peter Lehman observed that Orbison's absence was a part of the mystery of his persona: \"Since it was never clear where he had come from, no one seemed to pay much mind to where he had gone; he was just gone.\"<ref>Lehman, p. 2.</ref> His influence was apparent, however, as several artists released popular covers of his songs. Orbison's version of \"[[Love Hurts]]\" was remade by [[Gram Parsons]] and [[Emmylou Harris]], again by hard rock band [[Nazareth (band)|Nazareth]], and by [[Jim Capaldi]]. [[Sonny James]]' version of \"Only the Lonely\" reached number one on the country music charts.<ref name=\"Amburn\"/>{{refpage|p167-8}} [[Bruce Springsteen]] ended his concerts with Orbison songs, and [[Glen Campbell]] had a minor hit with a remake of \"Dream Baby\".\n\nA compilation of Orbison's greatest hits reached number one in the UK in January 1976, and Orbison began to open concerts that year for the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], who had started as [[Linda Ronstadt]]'s backup band.

''The New York Times''. p. 48.</ref>\n\nIn the 1960s, Orbison refused to splice edits of songs together and insisted on recording them in single takes with all the instruments and singers together.<ref>Lehman, p. 46.</ref> The only convention Orbison followed in his most popular songs is the time limit for radio fare in pop songs. Otherwise, each seems to follow a separate structure. Using the standard [[32-bar form]] for verses and choruses, normal pop songs followed the verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-verse-chorus structure. Where A represents the verse, B represents the chorus, and C the bridge, most pop songs can be represented by A-B-A-B-C-A-B, like \"Ooby Dooby\" and \"Claudette\". Orbison's \"In Dreams\" was a song in seven movements that can be represented as Intro-A-B-C-D-E-F; no sections are repeated. In \"Running Scared\", however, the entire song repeats to build suspense to a final climax, to be represented as A-A-A-A-B. \"Crying\" is more complex, changing parts toward the end to be represented as A-B-C-D-E-F-A-B'-C'-D'-E'-F'.<ref>Lehman, p. 53.</ref> Although Orbison recorded and wrote standard structure songs before \"Only the Lonely\", he claimed never to have learned how to write them:<ref name=\"nswhof\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nashvillesongwritersfoundation.com/l-o/roy-orbison.aspx |title=Roy Orbison |publisher=Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame |year=2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090102144848/http://www.nashvillesongwritersfoundation.com/l-o/roy-orbison.aspx |archive-date=January 2, 2009 |access-date=May 30, 2009}}</ref>\n\n{{blockquote|I'm sure we had to study composition or something like that at school, and they'd say 'This is the way you do it,' and that's the way I would have done it, so being blessed again with not knowing what was wrong or what was right, I went on my own way.&nbsp;... So the structure sometimes has the chorus at the end of the song, and sometimes there is no chorus, it just goes&nbsp;... But that's always after the fact—as I'm writing, it all sounds natural and in sequence to me. | Roy Orbison}}\n\n[[Elton John]]'s songwriting partner and main lyricist [[Bernie Taupin]] wrote that Orbison's songs always made \"radical left turns\", and [[k.d. lang]] declared that good songwriting comes from being constantly surprised, such as how the entirety of \"Running Scared\" eventually depends on the final note, one word.<ref>Lehman, p. 52.</ref> Some of the musicians who worked with Orbison were confounded by what he asked them to do. The Nashville session guitarist [[Jerry Kennedy]] stated, \"Roy went against the grain. The first time you'd hear something, it wouldn't sound right. But after a few playbacks, it would start to grow on you.\"<ref name=\"Amburn\"/>{{refpage|p128}}\n\n===Lyrical themes===\nCritic Dave Marsh categorizes Orbison's ballads into themes reflecting pain and loss, and dreaming. A third category is his uptempo rockabilly songs such as \"Go! Go! Go!\" and \"Mean Woman Blues\" that are more thematically simple, addressing his feelings and intentions in a masculine [[braggadocio (rap)|braggadocio]].{{citation needed|date=March 2024}} In concert, Orbison placed the uptempo songs between the ballads to keep from being too consistently dark or grim.<ref>Lehman, pp. 70–71.</ref>\n\nIn 1990, Colin Escott wrote an introduction to Orbison's biography published in a CD box set: \"Orbison was the master of compression. Working the singles era, he could relate a short story, or establish a mood in under three minutes. If you think that's easy—try it. His greatest recordings were quite simply perfect; not a word or note surplus to intention.\"<ref name=\"escott\"/> After attending a show in 1988, Peter Watrous of ''The New York Times'' wrote that Orbison's songs are \"dreamlike claustrophobically intimate set pieces\".<ref name=\"watrous\"/> Music critic Ken Emerson writes that the \"apocalyptic romanticism\" in Orbison's music was well-crafted for the films in which his songs appeared in the 1980s because the music was \"so over-the-top that dreams become delusions, and self-pity paranoia\", striking \"a post-modern nerve\".<ref>DeCurtis and Henke, p. 157.</ref> [[Led Zeppelin]] singer [[Robert Plant]] favored American R&B music as a youth, but beyond the black musicians, he named Elvis and Orbison especially as foreshadowing the emotions he would experience: \"The poignancy of the combination of lyric and voice was stunning. [Orbison] used drama to great effect and he wrote dramatically.\"<ref name=\"hall\"/>\n\nThe loneliness in Orbison's songs that he became most famous for, he both explained and downplayed: \"I don't think I've been any more lonely than anyone else&nbsp;... Although if you grow up in West Texas, there are a lot of ways to be lonely.\"<ref name=\"hall\"/> His music offered an alternative to the postured masculinity that was pervasive in music and culture. [[Robin Gibb]] of the [[Bee Gees]] stated, \"He made emotion fashionable, that it was all right to talk about and sing about very emotional things. For men to sing about very emotional things&nbsp;... Before that no one would do it.\"<ref name=\"hall\"/> Orbison acknowledged this in looking back on the era in which he became popular: \"When [\"Crying\"] came out I don't think anyone had accepted the fact that a man should cry when he wants to cry.\"<ref name=\"hall\"/>\n\n===Voice quality===\n{{Quote box\n | width = 30%\n | quote = What separates Orbison from so many other multi-octave-spanning power singers is that he can hit the biggest notes imaginable and still sound ''unspeakably sad'' at the same time. All his vocal gymnastics were just a means to a powerful end, not a mission unto themselves. Roy Orbison didn't just sing beautifully—he sang brokenheartedly.\n| source = —[[Stephen Thompson (journalist)|Stephen Thompson]], [[NPR]]<ref name=\"NPRsongswelove\">{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2011/04/28/135734524/roy-orbison-songs-we-love |title=Roy Orbison: Songs We Love |author=NPR staff |website=NPR |date=April 27, 2011 |access-date=April 29, 2011}}</ref>\n}}\n\nOrbison admitted that he did not think his voice was put to appropriate use until \"Only the Lonely\" in 1960, when it was able, in his words, to allow its \"flowering\".<ref>Lehman, p. 50.</ref> Carl Perkins, however, toured with Orbison while they were both signed with Sun Records and recalled a specific concert when Orbison covered the [[Nelson Eddy]] and [[Jeanette MacDonald]] standard \"[[Indian Love Call]]\", and had the audience completely silenced, in awe.<ref>Lehman, p. 49.</ref> When compared to The Everly Brothers, who often used the same session musicians, Orbison is credited with \"a passionate intensity\" that, according to ''The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock and Roll'', made \"his love, his life, and, indeed, the whole world [seem] to be coming to an end—not with a whimper, but an agonised, beautiful bang\".<ref name=decurtis155/>\n\nBruce Springsteen and [[Billy Joel]] both commented on the otherworldly quality of Orbison's voice. [[Dwight Yoakam]] stated that Orbison's voice sounded like \"the cry of an angel falling backward through an open window\".<ref>Lehman, p. 22.</ref> [[Barry Gibb]] of [[The Bee Gees]] went further to say that when he heard \"Crying\" for the first time, \"That was it. To me that was the voice of God.\"<ref name=\"hall\">Hall, Mark. (director) ''In Dreams: The Roy Orbison Story'', Nashmount Productions Inc., 1999.</ref> Elvis Presley stated Orbison's voice was the greatest and most distinctive he <!--check who 'they' are---> had ever heard.<ref name=\"Amburn\"/>{{refpage|p175,193}} Orbison's music and voice have been compared to opera by Bob Dylan, Tom Waits, and songwriter [[Will Jennings]], among others.{{sfn|Lehman|ref=none|p=21}} Dylan marked Orbison as a specific influence, remarking that there was nothing like him on radio in the early 1960s:<ref>Dylan, p. 33.</ref>{{Which|reason=Which source is this referring to?|date=October 2019}}\n\n{{blockquote|With Roy, you didn't know if you were listening to mariachi or opera. He kept you on your toes. With him, it was all about fat and blood. He sounded like he was singing from an Olympian mountaintop. [After \"Ooby Dooby\"] he was now singing his compositions in three or four octaves that made you want to drive your car over a cliff. He sang like a professional criminal&nbsp;... His voice could jar a corpse, always leave you muttering to yourself something like, \"Man, I don't believe it\". | Bob Dylan}}\n\nLikewise, Tim Goodwin, who conducted the orchestra that backed Orbison in Bulgaria, had been told that Orbison's voice would be a singular experience to hear. When Orbison started with \"Crying\" and hit the high notes, Goodwin stated: \"The strings were playing and the band had built up and, sure enough, the hair on the back of my neck just all started standing up. It was an incredible physical sensation.\"<ref name=\"Amburn\"/>{{refpage|p184}} Bassist [[Jerry Scheff]], who backed Orbison in his ''[[Roy Orbison and Friends: A Black and White Night|A Black and White Night]]'' concert, wrote about him, \"Roy Orbison was like an opera singer. His voice melted out of his mouth into the stratosphere and back. He never seemed like he was trying to sing, he just did it.\"<ref>Scheff, Jerry (2012). ''Way Down: Playing Bass with Elvis, Dylan, the Doors & More.'' Backbeat Books. p. 33.</ref>\n\nHis voice ranged from [[baritone]] to [[tenor]], and music scholars have suggested that he had a three- or four-octave range.<ref>{{cite web |last=O'Grady |first=Terence J. |date=February 2000 |url=http://www.anb.org/articles/18/18-02294.html |title=Orbison, Roy |website=American National Biography |url-access=subscription |access-date=May 20, 2009}}</ref>\n\nOrbison's severe stage fright was particularly noticeable in the 1970s and early 1980s. During the first few songs in a concert, the [[vibrato]] in his voice was almost uncontrollable, but afterward, it became stronger and more dependable.<ref name=\"Lehman, p. 24\">Lehman, p. 24.</ref> This also happened with age. Orbison noticed that he was unable to control the tremor in the late afternoon and evenings, and chose to record in the mornings when it was possible.<ref>{{Citation|last=Townsend|first=Paul|title=Roy Orbison, March 1967, Colston Hall, Bristol|date=January 2, 2014|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/brizzlebornandbred/11707869923/|access-date=October 24, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Live performances===\n[[File:Roy Orbison.jpg|thumb|250 px|Orbison, center (in white), performing in 1976]]\nOrbison often excused his motionless performances by saying that his songs did not allow instrumental sections so he could move or dance on stage, although songs like \"Mean Woman Blues\" did offer that.<ref>Lehman, p. 62.</ref> He was aware of his unique performance style even in the early 1960s when he commented, \"I'm not a super personality—on stage or off. I mean, you could put workers like [[Chubby Checker]] or [[Bobby Rydell]] in second-rate shows and they'd still shine through, but not me. I'd have to be prepared. People come to hear my music, my songs. That's what I have to give them.\"<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 78.</ref>\n\n[[k.d. lang]] compared Orbison to a tree, with passive but solid beauty.<ref>{{cite web |author=Lang, k. d. |date=April 15, 2004 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5939233/the_immortals__the_greatest_artists_of_all_time_37_roy_orbison |title=The Immortals – The Greatest Artists of All Time: 37) Roy Orbison |magazine=Rolling Stone |access-date=June 2, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506004850/https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5939233/the_immortals__the_greatest_artists_of_all_time_37_roy_orbison |archive-date=May 6, 2009}}</ref> This image of Orbison as immovable was so associated with him it was parodied by [[John Belushi]] on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', as Belushi dressed as Orbison falls over while singing \"Oh, Pretty Woman\", and continues to play as his bandmates set him upright again.<ref name=\"Lehman, p. 24\"/> However, Lang quantified this style by saying, \"It's so hard to explain what Roy's energy was like because he would fill a room with his energy and presence, but not say a word. Being that he was so grounded and so strong and so gentle and quiet. He was just there.\"<ref name=\"hall\"/>\n\nOrbison attributed his own passion during his performances to the period when he grew up in Fort Worth while the US was mobilizing for World War II. His parents worked in a defense plant; his father brought out a guitar in the evenings playing the driving rhythm of western swing, and their friends and relatives who had just joined the military gathered to drink and sing heartily with him. Orbison later reflected, \"I guess that level of intensity made a big impression on me, because it's still there. That sense of 'do it for all it's worth and do it now and do it good.' Not to analyze it too much, but I think the verve and gusto that everybody felt and portrayed around me has stayed with me all this time.\"<ref name=\"Amburn\"/>{{refpage|p7}}\n\n==Discography==\n{{Main|Roy Orbison discography}}\n'''Studio albums'''\n*''[[Lonely and Blue]]'' (1961)\n*''[[Roy Orbison at the Rock House]]'' (1961)\n*''[[Crying (album)|Crying]]'' (1962)\n*''[[In Dreams (Roy Orbison album)|In Dreams]]'' (1963)\n*''Oh, Pretty Woman'' (non-US) (1964)\n*''[[There Is Only One Roy Orbison]]'' (1965)\n*''[[Orbisongs]]'' (1965)\n*''[[The Orbison Way]]'' (1966)\n*''[[The Classic Roy Orbison]]'' (1966)\n*''[[Roy Orbison Sings Don Gibson]]''/''Sweet Dreams'' (Africa) (1967)\n*''[[Cry Softly Lonely One]]'' (1967)\n*''[[Roy Orbison's Many Moods]]'' (1969)\n*''[[Hank Williams the Roy Orbison Way]]'' (1970)\n*''[[The Big O (album)|The Big O]]'' (1970)\n*''[[Roy Orbison Sings]]'' (1972)\n*''[[Memphis (Roy Orbison album)|Memphis]]'' (1972)\n*''[[Milestones (Roy Orbison album)|Milestones]]'' (1973)\n*''[[I'm Still in Love with You (Roy Orbison album)|I'm Still in Love with You]]'' (1975)\n*''[[Regeneration (Roy Orbison album)|Regeneration]]'' (1976)\n*''[[Laminar Flow (album)|Laminar Flow]]'' (1979)\n*''[[Class of '55: Memphis Rock & Roll Homecoming]]'' (with [[Johnny Cash]], [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], and [[Carl Perkins]]) (1986)\n*''[[In Dreams: The Greatest Hits]]'' (1987)\n\n'''Posthumous albums'''\n*''[[Mystery Girl]]'' (1989)\n*''[[King of Hearts (Roy Orbison album)|King of Hearts]]'' (1992)\n*''[[The Last Concert (Roy Orbison album)|The Last Concert]]'' (2009)\n*''[[One of the Lonely Ones]]'' (2015)\n\n'''Remix albums'''\n*''[[A Love So Beautiful (album)|A Love So Beautiful]]'' (with [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra|The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]]) (2017)\n*''Unchained Melodies'' (with The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra) (2018)\n\n'''Concert videos'''\n* 1972: ''[[Live from Australia (Roy Orbison album)]]''\n* 1982: ''[[Live at Austin City Limits]]''\n* 1988: ''[[Roy Orbison and Friends: A Black and White Night]]''\n\n==Honors==\n''[[Rolling Stone]]'' placed him at number 37 on their list of the \"Greatest Artists of All Time\" and number 13 on their list of the \"100 Greatest Singers of All Time'.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-singers-of-all-time-19691231 |title=100 Greatest Singers of All Time |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=November 27, 2008 |via=Rolling Stone website |access-date=October 3, 2011}}</ref> In 2002, ''Billboard'' magazine listed Orbison at number 74 in the Top 600 recording artists.{{sfnp|Whitburn|2004|p=524}}\n\n* '''Grammy Awards'''<ref name=\"grammy\"/>\n** Best Country Performance Duo or Group (1980) (\"That Lovin' You Feelin' Again\", with Emmylou Harris)\n** Best Spoken Word or Non-Musical Recording (1986) (\"Interviews From The Class Of '55 Recording Sessions\", with Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis, Sam Phillips, Rick Nelson and Chips Moman)\n** Best Country Vocal Collaboration (1988) (\"Crying\", with k.d. lang)\n** Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal (1989) (''Traveling Wilburys Volume One'', as a member of the Traveling Wilburys)\n** Best Pop Vocal Performance, Male (1990) (\"Oh, Pretty Woman\")\n** Lifetime Achievement Award (1998)\n* [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] (1987)<ref name=\"rockhall\"/>\n* [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]] (1987)<ref name=\"nswhof\"/>\n* [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] (1989)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.songwritershalloffame.org/exhibits/C173 |title=Roy Orbison |publisher=Songwriters Hall of Fame |access-date=May 30, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130041222/http://www.songwritershalloffame.org/exhibits/C173 |archive-date=January 30, 2009}}</ref>\n* Star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] (2010)<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8488965.stm Roy Orbison given Hollywood Walk of Fame star] BBC News (January 30, 2010).
