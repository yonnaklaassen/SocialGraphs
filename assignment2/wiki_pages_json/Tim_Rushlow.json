Between 1991 and 1997, Rushlow was lead vocalist of country music group [[Little Texas (band)|Little Texas]], which recorded four albums and a Greatest Hits package, in addition to charting more than fifteen singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country singles charts during Rushlow's tenure as lead vocalist.\n\nAfter Little Texas disbanded in 1997, Rushlow began a solo career. His first recording was the musical track \"Totally Committed\" on comedian [[Jeff Foxworthy]]'s 1998 [[Totally Committed|album of the same name]]. Two years later, Rushlow signed to [[Atlantic Records]], recording one album and charting a Top Ten single on the country charts titled \"She Misses Him\". When Atlantic closed its country division in 2001, Rushlow formed a six-piece band called [[Rushlow]], which charted two singles and recorded one album for [[Lyric Street Records]] in 2003.\n\nRushlow and his cousin Doni Harris (a former member of Rushlow) founded the country music duo [[Rushlow Harris]] in 2003. This duo charted two singles on the country charts that year.\n\n==Biography==\nRushlow was born on October 6, 1966, in [[Midwest City, Oklahoma]], at Tinker Air Force base to a musical family.
