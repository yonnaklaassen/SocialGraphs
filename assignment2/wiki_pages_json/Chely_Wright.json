She initially rose to fame as a commercial country recording artist with several charting singles, including the number one hit, \"[[Single White Female (song)|Single White Female]].\" She later became known for her role in [[LGBT social movements|LGBT activism]] after publicly [[coming out]] as a [[lesbian|gay woman]] in 2010. She has sold over 1,500,000 copies and 10,000,000 digital impressions to date in the United States.<ref>{{cite news |last=Walsh |first=Chris M. |title=Chely Wright Comes Out As Country Music's First Openly Gay Singer |publisher=Billboard |date=May 4, 2010 |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/958369/chely-wright-comes-out-as-country-musics-first-openly-gay-singer |access-date=May 5, 2010}}</ref>\n\nRaised in Kansas, Wright developed aspirations to become a country singer and songwriter. Yet, as a young child, she discovered her [[homosexuality]] and realized it conflicted with her [[Christianity|Christian]] faith and her hopes of becoming a performer. Determined to become successful, she vowed to hide her sexuality and continued performing. Wright moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], following high school graduation and was cast in stage productions at the now-defunct [[Opryland USA]] amusement park. She eventually signed her first recording contract in 1993 with [[PolyGram]]/[[Mercury Records]] and released two albums. With limited success, Wright switched record labels and had her first hit with 1997's \"[[Shut Up and Drive (Chely Wright song)|Shut Up and Drive]]\". It was followed in 1999 with \"Single White Female,\" and a gold-certified album of the [[Single White Female (album)|same name]].\n\nAt her commercial zenith, Wright continued living a closeted life and became increasingly unhappy. She engaged in a long-term relationship with a woman but ultimately separated at the risk of being outed by members of the Nashville community. In 2006, Wright began suffering an emotional collapse and nearly took her own life. She then realized she needed to come out publicly and started working on projects that would help her come to terms with her [[homosexuality]]. In 2010, Wright released the memoir, ''[[Like Me: Confessions of a Heartland Country Singer]],'' and the album, ''[[Lifted Off the Ground]].'' Both projects centered around her coming out process and the acceptance of herself.\n\nWright became involved in LGBT activism following her 2010 decision. During that time she moved to [[New York City]] and released a documentary which chronicled her coming out titled, ''[[Wish Me Away]].'' She would later establish a charity \"Like Me\", which helped provide assistance to LGBT youth. She has since been a spokesperson for programs such as [[GLSEN]]. In recent years, she has held the role of [[Unispace]]'s Diversity, Equity and Inclusion officer. Wright would also marry and have two children. Wright also continued her music career, but transitioned more towards [[Americana (music)|Americana]] and [[Folk music|folk]]. She has since released 2016's ''[[I Am the Rain]]'' and 2019's ''Revival''.\n\n==Early life==\nWright was born in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], in 1970, and was raised in the nearby community of [[Wellsville, Kansas]].<ref name=\"Allmusic\"/>{{sfn|Wright, Chely|2010|p=4-5}} Wright was the youngest of three children born to Cheri and Stan Wright. Her parents' marriage was unhappy, partly due to her father's drinking. This caused the family to temporarily separate while Wright was a small child. She lived with her mother and two siblings in [[Ottawa, Kansas]], before her mother and father reunited.{{sfn|Wright, Chely|2010|p=5-7}} Wright had a strained relationship with her mother throughout her life. \"I wouldn't say we were friends or buddies, but I liked my Mom,\" she wrote in her 2010 memoir.{{sfn|Wright, Chely|2010|p=101}}\n\nWright became interested in her [[Christianity|Christian]] faith and convinced her mother to become [[Baptism|baptized]] when she was six years old.{{sfn|Wright, Chely|2010|p=8-10}} She also discovered her [[homosexuality]] after noticing she had a crush on her third grade teacher. However, church teachings taught her that homosexuality was considered sinful behavior. \"I heard the words 'whore,' 'criminal,' 'drunk,' 'homosexual,' 'pervert,' 'liar' and 'non-believer' all strung together so many times that I understood that those were the building blocks of sin and evildoing,\" she wrote in 2010.{{sfn|Wright, Chely|2010|p=15}} Every day as a child she prayed for her homosexual thoughts to be taken away.<ref name=\"NPR\">{{cite news |title=Chely Wright: From Nashville Star To Outcast Activist |url=https://www.npr.org/2012/05/31/154078309/chely-wright-from-nashville-star-to-outcast-activist |website=[[NPR]] |access-date=January 30, 2021}}</ref> She attempted to find other examples of people in her hometown who were also homosexual, but had no luck.{{sfn|Wright, Chely|2010|p=33}} In her childhood, Wright often blamed negative events on her homosexual thoughts. This included when her brother broke a bone and the death of her cousin, David. \"It was God's punishment for my being gay,\" she recalled.{{sfn|Wright, Chely|2010|p=44-47}}\n\n[[File:101207-Nashville-OprylandD-003.JPG|thumb|left|One of Wright's first jobs was as a performer at [[Opryland USA]], a theme park in [[Nashville, Tennessee]].]]\nWright developed a passion for music at a young age. Both her parents enjoyed [[country music]] and encouraged her to also appreciate it. Her father played [[acoustic guitar]], while she often sang along. Her mother kept handwritten lyrics to her favorite songs in a binder. The family often entertained guests on Saturday evenings and would throw \"pickin' parties.\" Wright often sang along with guests as they listened and played along to music.{{sfn|Wright, Chely|2010|p=20}} At age four, she began taking [[piano]] lessons.

She also began dating a college-aged man whom she met sitting in the audience of her shows. Yet, Wright also realized she could not form the ideal romantic relationship with him: \"But soon I was wresting with my old fears again. Nothing could save me from being gay.\"{{sfn|Wright, Chely|2010|p=62}}\n\nIn 1989, she landed a position in a musical production at [[Opryland USA]], a now-defunct theme park in [[Nashville, Tennessee]].<ref name=\"Allmusic\"/> Making numerous costume changes in tight quarters led Wright to become good friends with several cast members. She also learned to sing as part of a vocal chorus and learned dance routines.{{sfn|Wright, Chely|2010|p=64}} Her contract only lasted one season and she later moved into the basement of a friend's home closer to Nashville. She found employment at a local sporting goods store. It was at the store that she met a woman whom she would have her first brief intimate relationship with. During the summer of 1990, she was re-hired as part of the Opryland cast for a second season and started taking classes at [[Middle Tennessee State University]].{{sfn|Wright, Chely|2010|p=79-87}}\n\n==Music career==\n===1993–1996: Beginnings at PolyGram and the rise to success===\nWright was signed to a publishing deal as a songwriter, which helped secure a recording contract as a recording artist with [[PolyGram]]/[[Mercury Records]] in 1993.<ref name=\"Allmusic\"/> Wright chose to keep her sexuality hidden from her record label and buying public, a theme which continued throughout her commercial career.{{sfn|Wright, Chely|2010|p=152-53}} She collaborated on her first album with Nashville producer, [[Harold Shedd]]. In a mutual agreement, Shedd agreed that Wright's persona would not be centered around being \"a [music] video babe,\" but instead regarded for her artistic work as a country music artist.{{sfn|Wright, Chely|2010|p=88}} In 1994, Wright's debut studio album was released through the label titled ''[[Woman in the Moon (album)|Woman in the Moon]].''
