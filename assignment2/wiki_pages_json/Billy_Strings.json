His father died of a heroin overdose when he was two and his mother remarried Terry Barber, an accomplished amateur bluegrass musician whom Strings regards as his father.

He left the family home at the age of 13 and went through a period of hard drug usage. His family eventually achieved sobriety; Billy stopped using hard drugs and drinking alcohol, becoming [[California sober|\"California sober\"]] and consuming only cannabis and similar \"light drugs\" (ie psychedelics).<ref name=\"RollingStoneJune2022\">{{cite news |last1=Hudak |first1=Joseph |title=Drugs, Bluegrass, and Bass Fishing: How Billy Strings Outran His Past and Infiltrated the Mainstream |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/billy-strings-bluegrass-fishing-concert-1369241/ |access-date=25 August 2022 |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=June 22, 2022}}</ref><ref name=\"northernexpress.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.northernexpress.com/news/feature/article-5963-the-amazing-billy-strings/|title=The Amazing Billy Strings|publisher=Northern Express}}</ref> \n\nBarber was a heavy influence on his stepson, introducing him to traditional bluegrass artists at a young age,<ref name=\"rolling stone\"/> including [[Doc Watson]], [[Del McCoury]], [[David Grisman]],<ref name=\"Live for Live Music billy-strings\">{{cite web|url=https://liveforlivemusic.com/features/billy-strings-garcia-grisman/|title=Watch Billy Strings Crush Garcia & Grisman's \"Dreadful Wind & Rain\"|website=liveforlivemusic.com|date=March 23, 2018}}</ref> [[Bill Monroe]], [[John Hartford]], [[Ralph Stanley]], [[Earl Scruggs]] and [[Larry Sparks]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.midwesterngentleman.com/music/keep-stringin-the-billy-strings-interview/|title=Midwestern Gentleman - Keep Stringin': The Billy Strings Interview|date=December 8, 2019 |publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://wglt.org/post/billy-strings-just-beginning-already-wild-ride#stream/0|title=Billy Strings: Just Beginning An Already Wild Ride|publisher=[[NPR]]|access-date=November 7, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519173408/http://http/|archive-date=May 19, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> Strings is also a [[Rock music|rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|metal]] fan, influenced by [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Johnny Winter]], [[Widespread Panic]], [[Phish]], the [[Grateful Dead]], [[Def Leppard]], [[Between the Buried and Me]] and [[Black Sabbath]], and played in hard rock and indie rock bands in his teens.<ref name=\"northernexpress.com\"/><ref name=\"The Bluegrass Situation\">{{cite web|url=https://thebluegrasssituation.com/read/jumping-into-the-deep-end-a-conversation-with-billy-strings|title=JUMPING INTO THE DEEP END: A CONVERSATION WITH BILLY STRINGS|date=October 18, 2017 |publisher=The Bluegrass Situation}}</ref>\n\nApostol got his stage name, Billy Strings, from his aunt, who saw his ability on multiple traditional bluegrass instruments.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://greenvillejournal.com/2017/05/04/billy-strings-fascinatingly-unpredictable-performer/ |title=Billy Strings Is A Fascinatingly Unpredictable Performer|date=May 4, 2017 |publisher=Greenville Journal}}</ref>\n\n== Career ==\n\n=== Beginnings and ''Turmoil'' & ''Tinfoil'' (2012-2019) ===\n[[File:111219 RelixPressDayNYC BillyStrings JFaatzMedia-2910.jpg|left|thumb|300x300px|Billy Strings in 2019]]\nIn 2012, Don Julin, a mandolin player from [[Traverse City, Michigan]], and author of ''Mandolin for Dummies'', asked Strings to join him on a paying gig.
