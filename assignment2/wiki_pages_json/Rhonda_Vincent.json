She is the oldest of three children, and the only daughter of Johnny and Carolyn Vincent. Her brother Darrin is a member of the  Award-winning bluegrass group [[Dailey & Vincent]]. Her youngest brother Brian played with the family group, but is now a top executive with the Bimeda Corporation. A fifth-generation musician, Rhonda's musical career started at age five when she sang gospel songs with her family's band, which was later known as the \"Sally Mountain Show\".<ref>Craig Morrison, \"Vincent, Rhonda\" in Kristin N Burns, ed.

She later added [[fiddle]] to her list of instruments at 12. In an interview with ''Ingrams'' magazine, she said, \"Dad used to pick me up after school, and Grandpa would come over and we played until after dinner almost every night.

The family, including the younger brothers when they were old enough to play instruments, traveled and performed extensively across the [[Midwest]] in the 1970s and early 1980s. Except for living in [[Texas]] for a short time in 1974, and two summers (1977, 1978) spent employed as musicians at [[Silver Dollar City]] in [[Branson, Missouri]], the Vincent family used the Greentop area as home base.<ref>Janie Shriver & Jennie Higgins, ''It's a Family Affair''.

She learned about the music business from Nashville’s best like James Stroud, Jack McFadden, and Stan Barnett. Even while Vincent was still performing regularly with the Sally Mountain Show, she released her first solo album ''New Dreams and Sunshine'' in 1988. In 1985, Vincent had competed in the TV series ''You Can Be a Star'' on the original version of [[The Nashville Network]]. After winning the competition, she was signed to a recording contract; her first professional performance was with country singer and [[Grand Ole Opry]] star [[Jim Ed Brown]]. In the 1990s Vincent branched out into mainstream country music, releasing a pair of albums on the [[Giant Records (Warner)|Giant Records]] label, but did not have success there.\n[[File:Rhondavincent-fls.jpg|thumb|left|Rhonda Vincent on the Watson Stage, MerleFest, 2010]]\n\nWith the release of her album ''Back Home Again'' in 2000, Vincent returned to bluegrass with the goal of expanding both the musical reach and the accessibility of the genre.
