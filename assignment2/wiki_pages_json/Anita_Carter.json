She performed with her sisters, [[Helen Carter|Helen]] and [[June Carter Cash|June]], and her mother, [[Maybelle Carter|Maybelle]], initially under the name The Carter Sisters and Mother Maybelle. Carter had three top ten hits as well as other charting singles. She was the first to record the songs \"[[Blue Boy (song)|Blue Boy]]\" and \"[[Ring of Fire (song)|Ring of Fire]]\". Carter was also a songwriter, most notably co-writing the [[Johnny Cash]] hit \"[[Rosanna's Going Wild]].\"\n\nCarter recorded for a number of labels, both as a solo artist and with her family, including [[RCA Victor]], [[Cadence Records|Cadence]], [[Columbia Records|Columbia]], [[Audiograph]], [[United Artists]], [[Liberty Records|Liberty]] and [[Capitol Records|Capitol]].\n\n==Biography==\nAnita was the third daughter of [[Ezra Carter|Ezra]] and Maybelle Carter.\nBorn in [[Maces Spring, Virginia]], she scored two top ten hits in 1951 with \"[[Down the Trail of Achin' Hearts]]\" and \"[[Bluebird Island]],\" both duets with [[Hank Snow]]. In 1962, she recorded \"[[Ring of Fire (song)|Love's Ring of Fire]],\" written by her sister June and [[Merle Kilgore]]. After the song failed to make the charts, Johnny Cash recorded it as \"Ring of Fire\" in March 1963 with the horns and the Carter Sisters (along with Mother Maybelle). This version became a hit for Cash.\n\nShe reached the top ten again in 1968 with \"I Got You,\" a duet with [[Waylon Jennings]].<ref name=\"AMbio\">{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/anita-carter-mn0000920617/biography |title=Anita Carter Biography |last=Bush |first=John |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=January 5, 2020}}</ref> Carter also reached the top 50 with hits like \"I'm Gonna Leave You\" in 1966 and \"Tulsa County\" in 1971.\n\nOn March 26, 1952, she appeared on ''[[Kate Smith|The Kate Smith Evening Hour]]'' with her family band \"[[The Carter Sisters and Mother Maybelle]]\" as the first females to represent hillbilly/country music and Music City [[Nashville]] on national television.<ref>{{Citation |title=''The Kate Smith Evening Hour'' - 26 March 1952 |date=1952 |url=http://archive.org/details/TheKateSmithEveningHour26March1952 |publisher=National Broadcasting Company |access-date=2022-10-15}}</ref> On April 23, she returned to the program, where she performed a duet with [[Hank Williams]], on his song \"[[I Can't Help It (If I'm Still in Love with You)]]\".<ref>{{Cite web |title=Hank Williams Duets With Anita Carter On 1952 Episode Of 'The Kate Smith Evening Hour' |url=https://countrymusicfamily.com/hank-williams-duets-with-anita-carter-on-1952-episode-of-the-kate-smith-evening-hour/ |access-date=2022-10-15 |website=Country Music Family |language=en-US}}</ref> Then on May 21, she became the first female star of the Grand Ole Opry to sing a solo on [[The Kate Smith Evening Hour]] when she sang \"Just When I Needed You\".<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Kate Smith Evening Hour w/ WSM's Grand Ole Opry Guests, May 21st, 1952 [video recording] |url=https://digi.countrymusichalloffame.org/digital/collection/movingimage/id/1322/ |access-date=2022-10-15 |website=digi.countrymusichalloffame.org |language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Marriages===\nCarter married fiddler Dale Potter in 1950 (marriage was annulled shortly thereafter), [[session musician]] Don Davis in 1953 (divorced and then remarried), and [[Bob Wootton]] (lead guitarist for Johnny Cash's band [[Tennessee Three|The Tennessee Three]]) in 1974 (divorced).
