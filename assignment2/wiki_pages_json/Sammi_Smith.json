She is best known for her 1971 [[Crossover (music)|crossover]] hit \"[[Help Me Make It Through the Night]]\", which was written by [[Kris Kristofferson]]. She became one of the few women in the [[outlaw country]] movement during the 1970s.<ref name=\"encyclopediaofcountry\">{{cite book|last1=Tucker|first1=Stephen R.|author-link1=Sammi Smith|editor1-last=Kingsbury|editor1-first=Paul|editor2-last=McCall|editor2-first=Michael|editor3-last=Rumble|editor3-first=John|title=The Encyclopedia of Country Music|date=2012|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=978-0-19-539563-1|page=468|edition=Second}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nSammi Smith was born in [[Orange County, California]],<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Country Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1993|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-726-6|page=381}}</ref> but spent her childhood in Oklahoma, Texas, Arizona and Colorado. She dropped out of school at the age of 11 and began to sing professionally in nightclubs.<ref name=\"bufwack\">{{cite book|last1=Bufwack|first1=Mary A.|last2=Oermann|first2=Robert K.|title=Finding Her Voice: Women in Country Music 1800–2000|url=https://archive.org/details/findinghervoicew0000bufw/page/382|url-access=registration|date=2003|publisher=Vanderbilt University Press/Country Music Foundation Press|isbn=0-8265-1432-4|pages=[https://archive.org/details/findinghervoicew0000bufw/page/382 382–383]}}</ref> She was 15 when she married Floyd L. \"Bobby\" White, one of the best-known steel guitar players of his day. (White was inducted into the Steel Guitar Hall of Fame in 1990.) They had three children. She had her first divorce in 1966. She eventually had two more marriages. In 1967, [[Johnny Cash]]'s bass player [[Marshall Grant]] discovered her singing in the Someplace Else Night Club in downtown Oklahoma City.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> After Grant's discovery, she moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. When Johnny Cash learned of her talent, he helped her get signed with [[Columbia Records]]. Her first minor country hit was in 1968, titled \"So Long, Charlie Brown, Don't Look for Me Around\".<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> In 1971, she married her second husband, [[Jody Payne]]. They had one child, singer/actor/musician [[Waylon Payne]].\n\n==Success of \"Help Me Make It Through the Night\"==\n\"Help Me Make It Through the Night\" was Sammi Smith's career hit and the one that made her famous.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> She had been one of the rare women in the \"outlaw country\" movement sweeping country music in the 1970s. At this time, country was moving in two directions: \"outlaw\" and a more mainstream pop sound. However, \"outlaw country\" would be short-lived, with country taking on a distinctly pop cast by the end of the 1970s. Smith remained with the \"outlaw\" sound throughout the 1970s.\n\nIn 1970, Smith signed with a new label [[Mega Records]] and her first hit for her new label was called \"He's Everywhere\", which made the top 25 on the country charts. In 1971, she struck gold with \"Help Me Make It Through the Night\".<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> The song immediately became a No.&nbsp;1 hit on the country charts and No.&nbsp;8 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' U.S. pop chart. It sold over two million copies, and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]] by the [[R.I.A.A.]] in April 1971.<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\">{{cite book\n| first= Joseph\n| last= Murrells\n| year= 1978\n| title= The Book of Golden Discs\n| edition= 2nd\n| publisher= Barrie and Jenkins Ltd\n| location= London\n| page= [https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/303 303]\n| isbn= 0-214-20512-6\n| url= https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/303\n}}</ref> At first, record companies were uncomfortable with the song's honest sexuality, which was new for country music, but DJs tested the song and the response from listeners was enormous. The song had been composed by [[Kris Kristofferson]], who had recorded the only other previous version of the song. After Smith's hit, the song was covered by [[Gladys Knight & the Pips]] and [[Elvis Presley]]; both versions achieved more modest chart success.\n\nIn 1972, Sammi Smith won a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Best Female Country Vocal Performance]] that year, and Kristofferson took songwriting awards.\n\nCritics David Cantwell and Bill Friskics-Warren called \"Help Me Make It Through the Night\" \"a watershed event in the history of Nashville and country music\" and placed it at No. 1 in their book ''Heartaches by the Number: Country Music's 500 Greatest Singles.'' \"The dynamic country soul of the recording — thanks, for starters, to producer Jim Malloy and arranger Bill Walker — revealed the influences of a generation of Nashville music makers who had grown up listening not only to country music but also to rock & roll, jazz, pop, R&B, and even classical music,\" they wrote. \"A crossover smash, 'Help Me Make It Through the Night' signaled country's belated arrival in the rock and soul era.\"<ref name=\"heartaches\">{{cite book|last1=Cantwell|first1=David|last2=Friskics-Warren|first2=Bill|title=Heartaches by the Number: Country Music's 500 Greatest Singles|date=2003|publisher=Vanderbilt University Press/Country Music Foundation Press|isbn=0-8265-1424-3|pages=[https://archive.org/details/heartachesbynumb00fris/page/1 1]–2|url=https://archive.org/details/heartachesbynumb00fris|url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\n==After \"Help Me Make It Through the Night\"==\nAfter the success of her hit, Smith continued to have more success on the country charts. In 1973, Sammi moved to Dallas, Texas, with [[Waylon Jennings]] and [[Willie Nelson]] to become a country \"outlaw\". Smith continued to have an ongoing friendship with Jennings and Nelson for the rest of her life.\n\nSmith continued to have success with the Mega Records label until 1975. She reached ''Billboard'''s [[Hot Country Songs|Hot Country Singles]] Top 10 twice after the success of \"Help Me Make It Through the Night\" with \"Then You Walk In\" (1971) and [[Merle Haggard]]'s \"Today I Started Loving You Again\" (1975), her last top 10 hit.<ref name=\"whitburn\">{{cite book|last1=Whitburn|first1=Joel|title=Joel Whitburn's Top Country Songs 1944 to 2005|date=2005|publisher=Record Research|isbn=0-89820-165-9|page=353}}</ref> In 1972, \"I've Got to Have You\" was a successful country hit, and it broke onto the pop charts at No.&nbsp;77. Smith continued to score Top 40 country hits like \"The Rainbow in Daddy's Eyes\" (1974) and \"Long Black Veil\" (1974).<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/>\n\nIn 1976, after Mega Records closed its doors, Smith signed with [[Elektra Records]] and scored with several hits, including \"Sunday School to Broadway\" (1976), \"Loving Arms\" (1977), \"[[I Can't Stop Loving You]]\" (1977), and \"Days That End in Y\" (1977).\n\nIn 1979, Smith made a successful comeback album on Cyclone Records called ''Girl Hero''. The song \"What a Lie\" from that album became a top 20 country hit for Smith, peaking at No.&nbsp;16. She also recorded for Sound Factory Records during the early 1980s and scored her last top 20 in 1981 with \"Cheatin's a Two-Way Street.\" Her last charting single came in 1986 with \"Love Me All Over\", which peaked at No. 80 on ''Billboard'''s Hot Country Singles chart in 1986.<ref name=\"whitburn\"/>\n\n==Decline and retirement==\nAfter 1979, little was heard from Sammi Smith. She had moved to Arizona and became involved in Native American causes, working for [[Apache]]s.<ref name=\"bufwack\"/> She also started her own band named Apache Spirit, which was made up of Native Americans.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> In the mid-1980s, she married her final husband Johnny Johnson, and they ran a Cattle Ranch in Bristow, Oklahoma. She did appearances on the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville. She also toured Japan. She often brought her son Waylon Payne to guest star at the Opry. She also had a line of pottery, bath salts, and hand-painted ceramic tiles for the bathroom.\n\nIn 1995, the compilation album ''The Best of Sammi Smith'' was released, which consisted of her big hit and many other various [[countrypolitan]] songs. She had a total of 18 LPs during her career.\n\n==Death==\nOn February 12, 2005, at the age of 61, Sammi Smith died at her home in Oklahoma City of emphysema.<ref name=\"NYT\"/> Her remains were buried in Guymon, Oklahoma, which she claimed was her home town (in a ''[[Hee Haw]]'' episode that aired January 1, 1973).\n\nA tribute album was released in her honor on September 26, 2006, titled ''Help Me Make It Through the Night: The Memorial Album.''\n\n==Family==\nHer first husband was Hank Thompson's Brazos Valley steel guitarist Bob White. They had three children. Zenithapollostar born June 9, 1962, Robert Floyd White born November 26, 1963, and Snow Jewel White born December 9, 1964. Sammi and Bob divorced after their third child. Sammi later had a third son with Willie Nelson's guitarist Jody Payne. [[Waylon Payne|Waylon Malloy Payne]] was born April 5, 1972. Later she adopted two [[Apache]] sons, Albert and Alfred.\n\n==Discography==\n{{main|Sammi Smith discography}}\n\n==Awards==\n===CMA Awards===\n* 1971: Single of the Year for \"[[Help Me Make It Through the Night]]\"<ref name=\"cmawards\">{{cite web|title=Past CMA Awards Winners and Nominees – 2017 CMA Awards|url=http://www.cmaworld.com/cma-awards/past-winners/?appSession=249V9CO41U9439620C8Z98378MTH4KMN73P03XYP7RV91GDNR53V85HI39Y3Z2WHHHDA7L7I3EW02G6T2Y5E95B0OD82Q7ZXC1EJJT736P8J9ZDYHN667Q89HH96O24G|website=CMA World – Country Music Association|access-date=January 13, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Grammy Awards===\n* 1972: [[Best Female Country Vocal Performance]] for \"[[Help Me Make It Through the Night]]\"\n* 1998: [[Grammy Hall of Fame]] for \"[[Help Me Make It Through the Night]]\"\n\n==Award nominations==\n===CMA Awards===\n* 1971: Album of the Year for ''Help Me Make It Through the Night''\n* 1971: Female Vocalist of the Year<ref name=\"cmawards\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.allmusic.com/ All Music]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20031221124103/http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/smith_sammi/artist.jhtml Sammi Smith At CMT.com]\n* [http://omhof.com/inductee/sammi-smith/ Sammi Smith – Oklahoma Music Hall of FameOklahoma Music Hall of Fame]\n* Wolff, Kurt.
