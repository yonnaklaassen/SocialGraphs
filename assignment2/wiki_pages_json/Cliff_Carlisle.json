Carlisle was a [[yodel]]er and was a pioneer in the use of the Hawaiian [[steel guitar]] in country music.  He was a brother of country music star [[Bill Carlisle]].\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:FootprintsInTheSnow.ogg|thumb|FootprintsInTheSnow]]\nCarlisle was born in [[Taylorsville, Kentucky]] and began performing locally with cousin Lillian Truax at age 16. Truax's marriage put an end to the group, and Carlisle began playing with Wilber Ball, a guitarist and tenor harmonizer. The two toured frequently around the U.S. playing [[vaudeville]] and circus venues in the 1920s.\n\nCliff and Ball first played at [[Louisville, Kentucky]] radio station [[WHAS (AM)|WHAS-AM]] in 1930, which made them local stars, and later that year they recorded for [[Gennett Records]] and [[Champion Records (Richmond, Indiana)|Champion Records]]. In 1931, they recorded with [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]]. Toward the end of 1931, Carlisle signed with [[American Record Corporation|ARC]] and was offered performance slots on several radio stations, including [[WBT (AM)|WBT-AM]] in Charlotte, North Carolina, [[WLS (AM)|WLS-AM]] in Chicago  and [[WLW-AM]] in Cincinnati, Ohio. Cliff's brother [[Bill Carlisle]] became his guitarist after Ball left in 1934. During the 1930s Carlisle, who recorded a large amount of material despite a hiatus from 1934 to 1936, frequently released songs with sexual connotations including barnyard metaphors (which became something of a hallmark).\n\nCarlisle toured with his son, \"Sonny Boy Tommy,\" to occasional consternation from authorities in areas where this contravened local child labor laws. He continued to perform on [[WMFS (AM)|WMPS-AM]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]] for several years in the 1940s, but by the 1950s had retired from music.\n\nIn the 1960s, [[The Rooftop Singers]] covered his tune \"Tom Cat Blues\"; in its wake, Carlisle and Ball did a few reunion shows together and recorded for Rem Records. On April 2, 1983, Carlisle died at the age of 79 in [[Lexington, Kentucky]].\n\n==Legacy==\nCarlisle's 1933 song \"[[Goin' Down The Road Feelin' Bad]]\" is featured in the 2017 video game ''[[Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/getting-over-it-is-a-hellacious-new-game-from-the-maker-of-qwop/ |title=Getting Over It is a brutal new game from the maker of QWOP |last=Wood |first=Austin |date=2017-09-27 |website=PC Gamer |language=en-US |access-date=2019-04-22 |quote=And I thought the irony of the smooth jazz was bad.
