Jones's career gained wider critical acclaim in 2006 with the release of her album, ''[[My Remembrance of You]]''.  The album made a number of critics end-of-the-year \"best of\" lists.  The ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' rated the album as the \"best country recording of 2006\" and described Jones as \"an Americana gem\", whose sound rides \"an old-timey vibe that never sounds fussy, ... in a voice subtly shaded by the high lonesome sound.\"<ref name = \"Tribune\">Chrissie Dickinson, \"The Best of 2006: Music Recordings: Country: No substitute for experience\", ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', December 10, 2006 ([http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/chi-0612090228dec10,1,7127316.story?coll=chi-ent_music-hed article]{{Dead link|date=November 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }})</ref>\n\nJones has also won a number of songwriting competitions including the venerable \"New Folk\" competition at the 2006 [[Kerrville Folk Festival]].

She was first drawn to [[country music]] in the early 1980s while attending high school on [[Long Island]].  While her peers were listening to [[Michael Jackson]], [[Kenny Loggins]] and [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] she began to seek out recordings by [[Johnny Cash]] and [[Patsy Cline]].<ref name = \"Dispatch\">{{cite news| author=Eidhenberger, Bill | title=Preview of Diana Jones: Love of folk a tradition for writer, her family| publisher='[[Columbus Dispatch]]| date=January 17, 2007| url=http://www.dispatch.com/features-story.php?story=dispatch/2007/01/17/20070117-B1-03.html| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110523054714/http://www.dispatch.com/live/contentbe/dispatch/2007/01/17/20070117-B1-03.html| archive-date=2011-05-23}}</ref>\nShe was also drawn to contemporary acts like [[Dolly Parton]] and [[Emmylou Harris]].<ref name = \"bio\">[http://dianajonesmusic.com/pages/story.htm Official Biography] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070209134750/http://www.dianajonesmusic.com/pages/story.htm |date=February 9, 2007 }} from dianajonesmusic.com, accessed January 22, 2007</ref>\n\nAfter graduating from college Jones was reunited with her birth family in eastern [[Tennessee]].<ref name = \"Dispatch\"/> It was there that she also gained a sense of her musical heritage when she discovered her grandfather, Robert Lee Maranville, was a talented singer and had been in a [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]] band with [[Chet Atkins]].  \"I found my first [[Smithsonian Folkways]] recording of Southern ballads up at [[Cades Cove]] in the [[Great Smoky Mountains|Smokies]] on a drive with him\", Jones explained to the ''[[Columbus Dispatch]]''. \"I put it in the CD player, and he started singing along and tapping his finger on his leg. He knew all those songs...I felt like I had discovered the source of what I had been trying to find musically.\"<ref name = \"Dispatch\"/>\n\nIn the 1990s Jones continued to develop as a writer and performer in the [[Music of Austin|music scene]] around [[Austin, Texas]] She released two albums, signed a deal with Hamstein Publishing,<ref name = \"Hamstein\">[http://www.hamstein.com/ Hamstein] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070228172325/http://www.hamstein.com/ |date=February 28, 2007}}, publisher, official site</ref> and began to develop a grass roots following.\n\nIt was the death of Maranville in 2000 that caused her to move back to the northeastern United States and enter a period of personal reflection: \"I wrote this last project [''My Remembrance of You''] in a cabin in the woods, trying to recover my balance after the loss of my grandfather. I was writing songs because I had to, for myself.\"<ref name = \"Dispatch\"/>\n\n== Career ==\nAlthough widely recognized as an \"emerging artist\" in 2006, Jones's recording and songwriting career began a decade earlier.  Her 1997 debut, ''Imagine Me'', has been described as a combination of \"the traditional American folk genre with a cutting edge on modern female folk music.\"<ref name = \"FAME97\">Julie Block, \"Review: ''Imagine Me''\", edited by Shawn Linderman, [http://www.acousticmusic.com/pfms/ Peterborough Folk Music Society] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206091420/http://www.acousticmusic.com/pfms/ |date=February 6, 2007 }}/[http://www.acousticmusic.com/frames/fame.htm Folk and Acoustic Music Exchange], 1997</ref>\nTwo years later, Jones followed-up with ''The One That Got Away''.\n\nJones really caught the attention of folk music fans when she re-emerged with ''My Remembrance of You''.  The album was released March 12, 2006.  It was dedicated to her late grandfather while also paying tribute to producer and archivist [[Alan Lomax]].<ref name = \"Dispatch\"/>\n\nThe recording almost immediately received high praise from critics.<ref name = \"Tribune\"/><ref name = \"FAME06\">Sonny Thomas, \"Review: ''My Remembrance of You''\", edited by David N.

Other musicians include [[Duke Levine]] on strings, [[Bob Dick]] on bass, [[Lorne Entress]] on percussion, and [[Jay Ungar]] on fiddle.\n\nPerhaps the most noted track in the collection is \"Pony\", a song told from the viewpoint of a young Native American girl in the 1920s who is forced to assimilate to a life and culture that is not her own.\n\n\"Pony\" features [[Ferron]] on backing vocals. In addition to being nominated for a \"Song of the Year\" award by the [[North American Folk Alliance]], the song finished the year at number 15 in the 2006 year-end Folk Radio Airplay Chart.<ref name = \"FDJ-L\">[http://folkradio.org/06topsongs.html Top Folk Songs of 2006] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070923124909/http://www.folkradio.org/06topsongs.html |date=September 23, 2007}} by FolkDJ-L DJs, compiled by Richard Gillmann</ref>\n\nIn 2007 Jones produced an album of songs written and performed with [[North Carolina]]-based songwriter [[Jonathan Byrd (musician)|Jonathan Byrd]].  ''[[Radio Soul]]''  is a stripped down recording featuring the voices and guitars of the two songwriters with little added instrumentation.\n\nIn September 2008, [[Joan Baez]] released a recording of Jones's \"Henry Russell's Last Words\" on her album ''[[Day After Tomorrow (Joan Baez album)|Day After Tomorrow]]''. Baez' album has since been nominated for a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]].\n\nIn 2009, Jones released \"Better Times Will Come\" on Proper Records which included \"Henry Russell's Last Words,\" \"Cracked and Broken,\" and \"The Day I Die.\" Nanci Griffith sang back up on the title track.\n\nHigh Atmosphere (Proper) was released in 2011.\n\nMuseum of Appalachia Recordings was recorded at Peters Homestead Cabin, Museum of Appalachia, in Clinton, Tennessee in December 2012, and released in November 2013. Recorded live with two session musicians, the record was inspired by the love of old-time Appalachian music Jones's grandfather passed on to her.\n\nJones is frequently compared to other distinct voices in [[Americana music]] such as [[Gillian Welch]], [[Iris DeMent]], and [[Alison Krauss]].<ref name = \"Tribune\"/> Jones states that she is flattered by the comparisons and if asked to add a name to the list suggests \"[[Ginny Hawker]] would be the name I would add. She has one of the truest voices I have heard. I love everything about the way she sings a song.\"<ref name = \"Dispatch\"/>\n\nJones has shared the stage with many artists, including Janis Ian, Steve Earle, Martina McBride, Nanci Griffith, Richard Thompson, John Gorka, Mary Gauthier, Old Crow Medicine Show, Guy Clark, and many others.\n\n== Discography ==\n* ''Imagine Me'' (1997, New Shoes Records)\n* ''[[The One That Got Away (Diana Jones album)|The One That Got Away]]'' (1998, New Shoes Records)\n* ''[[My Remembrance of You]]'' (2006, NewSong Recordings)\n* ''[[Radio Soul]]'', with [[Jonathan Byrd (musician)|Jonathan Byrd]] (May 2007)\n* ''Better Times Will Come'' (February 2009, [[Proper Records]] [UK]/ April 2009 [US])\n* ''High Atmosphere'' (April 5, 2011, USA)\n* ''Museum Of Appalachia Recordings'' (July 8, 2013 Proper Records [UK]/ November 5, 2013 Goldmine Records USA)\n* ''Song to a Refugee'' (September 25, 2020, [[Proper Records]])\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.dianajonesmusic.com/ Diana Jones], official web site\n* [http://www.myspace.com/dianajonesmusic  Diana Jones] at [[MySpace]]\n\n== Notes and references ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jones, Diana}}\n[[Category:American women country singers]]\n[[Category:American country singer-songwriters]]\n[[Category:American women singer-songwriters]]\n[[Category:American folk singers]]\n[[Category:Sarah Lawrence College alumni]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Year of birth missing (living people)]]\n[[Category:Proper Records artists]]\n[[Category:Country musicians from Tennessee]]\n[[Category:21st-century American women singers]]\n[[Category:21st-century American singer-songwriters]]\n[[Category:Singer-songwriters from Tennessee]]"
