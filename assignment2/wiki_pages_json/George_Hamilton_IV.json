When Hamilton's elder son George Hege Hamilton V was seven years old, he found one of his father's guitars and began writing songs. He became a singer, using the name \"Hege V\" because his father and the [[George Hamilton (actor)|actor, George Hamilton]] were already both using the same name. The younger Hamilton said his father \"never pushed me\", but he eventually began playing in nightclubs. On his tours, which sometimes included his father, Hege V played rhythm guitar and sang harmony and occasionally the lead, including some of his father's songs.<ref>{{cite news |last=Hurst |first=Jack |date=June 8, 1987 |title=Hege V Dries His Tears, Hits the Road for 'House' |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1987-06-08-8702120091-story.html |access-date=29 January 2019}}</ref> George has four grandchildren including George Hege \"Nash\" Hamilton VI,<ref name=\"theguardian.com\" /> Peyton McAlester Hamilton, Aubrey Elizabeth Arcure, and James Michael \"Mick\" Arcure.{{citation needed|date=January 2022}}\n\nHamilton had a heart attack on September 13, 2014, and died on September 17 at [[Saint Thomas - Midtown Hospital (Nashville)|Saint Thomas Midtown Hospital]] in Nashville.<ref>{{cite web |title=Opry star George Hamilton IV dead at age 77 |url=http://www.tennessean.com/story/entertainment/music/2014/09/17/george-hamilton-iv-year-opry-star-dies-age/15808327/ |access-date=September 17, 2014 |work=The Tennessean}}</ref> On September 24, the [[Ryman Auditorium]] hosted a memorial service, which included performances by Marty Stuart, Ricky Skaggs, the Whites, [[Jett Williams]], Gail Davies, Connie Smith, Dave Moody, Jimmy Capps, Barry and Holly Tashian, the Babcocks, Andrew Greer, and [[Cindy Morgan]].
