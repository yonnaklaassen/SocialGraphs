His parents separated when he was three. He was raised by his mother in Macon, and during the summer he spent time with his father in [[Homestead, Florida]]. He attended [[Windsor Academy]], a private Christian school in [[Bibb County, Georgia]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Jason Aldean |url=https://waknights.com/our_team/jason-aldean/ |access-date=July 26, 2023 |website=Windsor Academy Knights}}</ref> Before his father went to his work, Aldean would map out guitar chords on notebook paper to show his son where to place his fingers to play the chords and Jason would sit and practice all day while his father was at work. When his father got home, he got out his own guitar and they played together. Soon he could play a song after hearing it only a few times. His early favorites included [[George Strait]]'s \"[[The Cowboy Rides Away (song)|The Cowboy Rides Away]]\", [[Hank Williams Jr.]]'s \"The Blues Man\", and [[Alabama (American band)|Alabama]]'s \"[[My Home's in Alabama (song)|My Home's in Alabama]]\".\n\nBoth of his parents encouraged young Aldean as he progressed musically. From age 14, after watching the country-music awards on television, he wanted to perform on stage. With his mother's help, he performed at the local VFW hall in Macon. He sang [[John Anderson (musician)|John Anderson]]'s song \"[[Seminole Wind (song)|Seminole Wind]]\" and [[Tracy Lawrence]]'s \"[[Sticks and Stones (Tracy Lawrence song)|Sticks and Stones]]\". He then began performing at area talent contests and local fairs. At 15, he joined the \"house band\" at Georgia nightspot Nashville South.\n\nIn order to stand out, Aldean changed the spelling of his middle name, Aldine, to come up with the name Aldean.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wycd.cbslocal.com/2015/01/20/10-country-stars-that-use-stage-names|title=10 Country Stars That Use Stage Names|date=January 20, 2015|access-date=June 28, 2015|archive-date=June 30, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630221330/http://wycd.cbslocal.com/2015/01/20/10-country-stars-that-use-stage-names/|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===1998–2004: Career beginnings===\nAfter high school, with his father's help, Aldean and his band performed at clubs and festivals around the Southeast.

He has raised close to $4 million for cancer research through donating a portion of each ticket sale, special merchandise, VIP meet and greets, a donate button on his website, and his annual Concert for the Cure, most of which he has contributed to [[Susan G. Komen for the Cure]].<ref>{{cite web |title=#MoreThanPinkHero: Jason Aldean passes the $4 million mark raising money for breast cancer |url=http://sandhillsexpress.com/abc_music-co/morethanpinkhero-jason-aldean-passes-the-4-million-mark-raising-money-for-breast-cancer-abcid36116640/ |website=News Hill Nebraska |access-date=December 7, 2018 |archive-date=December 9, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181209165216/http://sandhillsexpress.com/abc_music-co/morethanpinkhero-jason-aldean-passes-the-4-million-mark-raising-money-for-breast-cancer-abcid36116640/ |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Band members==\n* Jason Aldean – lead vocals, guitar, piano\n* Tully Kennedy – bass guitar, backing vocals\n* Kurt Allison – lead guitar\n* Rich Redmond – drums, percussion \n* Carl Ray (Jay) Jackson – pedal steel guitar, banjo, backing vocals\n* Jack Sizemore – guitar, backing vocals\n\n==Discography==\n{{Main|Jason Aldean discography}}\n\n===Studio albums===\n*''[[Jason Aldean (album)|Jason Aldean]]'' (2005)\n*''[[Relentless (Jason Aldean album)|Relentless]]'' (2007)\n*''[[Wide Open (Jason Aldean album)|Wide Open]]'' (2009)\n*''[[My Kinda Party]]'' (2010)\n*''[[Night Train (Jason Aldean album)|Night Train]]'' (2012)\n*''[[Old Boots, New Dirt]]'' (2014)\n*''[[They Don't Know (Jason Aldean album)|They Don't Know]]'' (2016)\n*''[[Rearview Town]]'' (2018)\n*''[[9 (Jason Aldean album)|9]]'' (2019)\n*''[[Macon, Georgia (album)|Macon, Georgia]]'' (2021–2022)\n*''[[Highway Desperado]]'' (2023)\n\n==Tours==\n'''Headlining'''\n*2008: [[Country Music Television|CMT]] ON TOUR: Relentless\n*2010: Wide Open Tour\n*2011–12: My Kinda Party Tour\n*2013: [[2013 Night Train Tour|Night Train Tour]]\n*2014–15: [[Burn It Down Tour]]\n**Twelve shows in 2015 were merged with [[Kenny Chesney]], ''[[The Big Revival Tour]]'')\n*2016: [[We Were Here Tour|We Were Here/Six String Circus Tour]]\n*2017: They Don't Know Tour<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.soundslikenashville.com/news/jason-aldean-announces-massive-they-dont-know-tour/|title=Jason Aldean Announces Massive They Don't Know Tour|date=January 13, 2017|work=Sounds Like Nashville|access-date=April 5, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref>\n*2018: High Noon Neon Tour\n*2019: Ride All Night Tour\n*2020: We Back Tour\n*2021: Back in the Saddle Tour\n*2022: Rock N' Roll Cowboy Tour\n*2023: Highway Desperado Tour\n*2024: Highway Desperado Tour \n*2024: Rock the Country Tour<ref>{{Cite web |last=Gibbs |first=Audrey |title=Jason Aldean, Kid Rock headline Rock the Country festival visiting small towns.
