During an appearance on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'', Knoxville promoted Wade's songs, which were favorably received by Stern and his audience and given frequent airplay thereafter.\n\nWade's lyrics satirically and detrimentally deal with topics and stereotypes relating to [[Redneck (stereotype)|redneck]] and [[honky tonk]] culture. Before nearly every live song, Roger states, \"this is a song about a girl\".  He co-wrote the hit song \"[[Country State of Mind]]\" with [[Hank Williams, Jr.]]<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.outlawmagazine.tv/content/brandy-lee-dixon-interviews-roger-alan-wade/ |title=Roger Alan Wade |website=Outlaw Magazine |date=September 27, 2011 |accessdate=March 1, 2017}}</ref>\n\nHis songs feature [[folk music|folky]] arrangements, featuring little or no accompaniment beyond [[Steel-string acoustic guitar|acoustic guitar]].  His best known compositions include \"BB Gun\", \"Butt Ugly Slut\", \"D-R-U-N-K\", \"Poontang\", and \"If You're Gonna Be Dumb\".  Wade's lesser known works are less hysterical and carry a more lyrical tone including \"The First Time I Saw Waylon\", \"Brainerd Road\", and \"Jingle Jangle\". His song \"If You're Gonna Be Dumb You Gotta Be Tough\" has appeared in every ''Jackass'' film, with Wade's version on the first film and subsequent films featuring covers of the song by [[Smut Peddlers]], [[Karen O]], [[The Deadly Syndrome]], [[Yelawolf]] and [[DJ Paul]], and [[Starcrawler]]. Wade wrote \"The Light Outlives the Star\" for a friend of his daughter who died in an automobile accident. It later served as a tribute to his friend and fan, [[Ryan Dunn]], who died in a car accident on June 20, 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.digitalspy.com/showbiz/a328144/jackass-cast-pay-tribute-to-ryan-dunn-video/ |title='Jackass' cast pay tribute to Ryan Dunn |website=Digital Spy |date=July 4, 2011 |access-date=April 5, 2019}}</ref>\n\nWade has provided voiceover work for [[WUUQ]] 97.3 and 99.3 FM, a classic country station in Chattanooga, Tennessee, as well as classic country formatted [[WBZW|WWLG]] \"96.7 The Legend\" in Atlanta, Georgia from its launch in late 2007 to around 2009.
