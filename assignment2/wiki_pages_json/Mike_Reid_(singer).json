He played as a [[defensive tackle]] for five seasons with the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] in the [[National Football League]] (NFL).\n\nBorn and raised in [[Altoona, Pennsylvania]], Reid attended and graduated from [[Pennsylvania State University]], where he played [[college football]] for the [[Penn State Nittany Lions football|Penn State Nittany Lions]]. Selected by the Bengals in the first round of the [[1970 NFL draft]] with the seventh overall pick, he earned trips to the [[Pro Bowl]] after the 1972 and 1973 seasons, before retiring after the 1974 season. He subsequently focused on his musical career, co-writing several hit singles for country music artists, including [[Ronnie Milsap]]'s \"[[Stranger in My House (Ronnie Milsap song)|Stranger in My House]]\", which won a [[Grammy Award for Best Country Song]] in 1984. Reid later began a solo recording career, releasing two studio albums for [[Columbia Records]]. He charted seven singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now [[Hot Country Songs]]) chart as a singer, including the number one hit \"[[Walk on Faith]]\".\n\n==Football career==\nAt college, Reid was a captain on both the Nittany Lions undefeated 1968 and 1969 teams that went 22–0.\nIn his senior year (1969), the tackle spearheaded Penn State on defense with 89 [[Tackle (football move)|tackles]] and was a unanimous [[1969 College Football All-America Team|All-America]] choice and All-East selection. He won the Outland Trophy as the best College football interior lineman in 1969, and also was awarded the 1969 [[Maxwell Award]] and finished fifth in the [[Heisman Trophy]] balloting. Reid also [[Collegiate wrestling|wrestled]] at Penn State and in 1967 he won the Eastern heavyweight wrestling title.<ref>[http://gopsusports.cstv.com/auto_pdf/p_hotos/s_chools/psu/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/Hall_of_Fame] {{dead link|date=November 2021}}</ref> In addition to athletics, Reid played Chicago gangster Big Julie in Penn State's production of the musical Guys and Dolls.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=https://www.centredaily.com/news/local/education/penn-state/article231555948.html|title=\"Experience the genuine.\" Former Penn State football star Mike Reid talks new musical|author=Sarah Paez|website=Centredaily.com|access-date=November 18, 2021}}</ref>\n\nReid was the first-round selection (#7 pick overall) of the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] in the [[1970 NFL draft]].<ref>{{cite web |title=1970 NFL Draft Listing |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/1970/draft.htm |website=Pro-Football Reference |access-date=6 January 2021}}</ref> In the team's third season, it won the [[American Football Conference Central Division|AFC Central Division]] and made the playoffs. In 1971, Reid established himself as one of the NFL's best pass rushers by recording 12 [[Quarterback sack|sack]]s, a figure he repeated in 1972. In 1971 Reid was a consensus All-AFC selection and the following year he was consensus [[All-Pro]] as well as being voted consensus All-AFC again.\n\nIn 1973, he topped those marks by recording 13 sacks. He was named All-Pro by the [[Newspaper Enterprise Association]] (NEA) and was second-team All-Pro according to the [[Associated Press]] and [[Pro Football Writers Association]]. For the third consecutive season Reid was consensus All-AFC.\n\nIn 1974, due primarily to injuries, he recorded only seven sacks, bringing his career total to 49. In his final season, Reid was again an All-AFC selection by ''[[Pro Football Weekly]]''. Although sacks were an unofficial statistic, the Bengals kept track of them and Reid retired as the leading sacker in the team's short history.\n\nHe made two trips to the [[Pro Bowl]] (1972 and 1973) before his retirement following the [[1974 NFL season|1974 season]] due to knee and hand injuries and his desire to focus on a music career. In 1996, he received the [[National Football League Alumni|NFL Alumni]] Career Achievement Award for his success in his post-NFL career.\n\nHe was elected to the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] in 1987 and received the [[Walter Camp Alumni of the Year|Walter Camp \"Alumnus of the Year\"]] award in 1987. In 1995, he received the [[List of Silver Anniversary Awards (NCAA) Recipients|NCAA Silver Anniversary Award]]. Reid was named as part of the Bengals' 40th Anniversary All-Time team in 2007. In 2017, Reid was named as part of the Bengals' 50th Anniversary All-Time Team.\n\n==Music career==\nAfter receiving his [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in music from [[Pennsylvania State University]] in 1969, Reid would perform as a pianist for the [[Utah Symphony Orchestra]], [[Dallas Symphony Orchestra]], and [[Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Paez |first1=Sarah |title='Experience the genuine.'

Living in Mount Lookout, he drove Eastern Avenue daily, and slowly \"Eastern Avenue River Railway Blues\" grew out of that. After a gig in Atlanta, Reid and some other musicians attended Southeastern Music Hall about 3:30&nbsp;a.m. A cassette tape of that session somehow found its way to Jerry Jeff Walker, who, in 1978, became the first artist to record a Reid song, that being \"Eastern Avenue River Railway Blues\".<ref>\"An American Poet\" by Roger Naylor, Cincinnati Magazine, October 1988, pages 36-37</ref>\n\nIn 1980, Reid moved to Nashville, and quickly became known as an in-demand songwriter for [[Ronnie Milsap]]. [[Larry Gatlin]] also helped Reid spearhead his songwriting career.\n\nIn 1984, Reid won a [[Grammy Award for Best Country Song]] with \"[[Stranger in My House (Ronnie Milsap song)|Stranger in My House]]\", which was recorded by Ronnie Milsap. Reid would also contribute compositions to artists such as [[Marie Osmond]], [[Tanya Tucker]], [[Collin Raye]], [[Alabama (American band)|Alabama]], and [[Conway Twitty]]. In the 1980s and 1990s, Reid wrote 12 No. 1 singles<ref name=nsf>{{cite web|title=Mike Reid|url=http://www.nashvillesongwritersfoundation.com/p-s/mike-reid.aspx|work=Nashville Songwriters Foundation|access-date=17 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216151416/http://www.nashvillesongwritersfoundation.com/p-s/mike-reid.aspx|archive-date=16 February 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> including \"[[Forever's as Far as I'll Go]]\", which was recorded in 1990 by [[Alabama (American band)|Alabama]]; their 29th number one country hit. He was also featured as a guest vocalist on Milsap's \"[[Old Folks (Ronnie Milsap and Mike Reid song)|Old Folks]]\", a No.&nbsp;2 hit from early 1988.  He also co-wrote, with [[Allen Shamblin]], [[Bonnie Raitt]]'s hit \"[[I Can't Make You Love Me]]\", which reached #18 on the Billboard Pop Charts and has been covered by countless artists.\n\nIn 1990, Reid signed to [[Columbia Records]] as a recording artist. His debut album ''[[Turning for Home]]'' produced a No. 1 country hit in its lead-off single \"[[Walk on Faith]]\", although the album's other singles were not as successful. His second album, 1992's ''[[Twilight Town]]'', produced two singles which both missed the Top 40.\n\nA third album, ''New Direction Home,'' was released two decades later in 2012 by the small Off Row Records label<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/page/music1502029/mike-reid-nfl-all-pro-turned-country-music-hitmaker|title=The NFL's country music hit maker|date=16 January 2015|website=Espn.com|access-date=18 November 2021}}</ref> and is available on iTunes and Spotify as well as in an mp3 download from Reid's website.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mikereidmusic.com/|title=HOME|website=Mikereidmusic.com|access-date=18 November 2021}}</ref>\n\nBy 1991, Reid composed the music for the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] musical ''A House Divided''. Over the following two decades, he wrote more [[Musical theatre|musicals]], including ''Quilts'', ''Different Fields'', ''Eye of the Blackbird'', ''Tales of Appalachia'', ''In This House'', and ''The Ballad of Little Jo'', a 1997 winner of the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters|Academy of Arts and Letters']] '[[Richard Rodgers Award for Musical Theater]]'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artsandletters.org/awards2_popup.php?abbrev=rodgers |title=American Academy of Arts and Letters - Award Winners |access-date=2010-06-06 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100912211155/http://www.artsandletters.org/awards2_popup.php?abbrev=Rodgers |archive-date=2010-09-12 }} Richard Rodgers Award for Musical Theater</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gene-watson.com/index.php/peers/peers-2012/mike-reid.html|title=Original Gene Watson Fan Site - Gene Watson's Peers: Quote from Mike Reid: May 2012|website=Gene-watson.com|access-date=18 November 2021}}</ref>\n\nIn 2019, he again returned to the musical theater stage with ''The Last Day,'' a commissioned production co-written with NYU Tisch School of Performing Arts Assistant Dean, Sarah Schlesinger, for Reid's alma mater, Penn State.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nReid was inducted into the [[Nashville Songwriters Foundation|Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 2005.<ref name=\"nsf\" />\n\n==Discography==\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:10em;\"| Title\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:18em;\"| Album details\n!
