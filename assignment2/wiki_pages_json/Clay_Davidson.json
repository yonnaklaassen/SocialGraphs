He signed to [[Virgin Records]]' Nashville division in late 1999. Davidson released his debut album ''[[Unconditional (Clay Davidson album)|Unconditional]]'' on April 11, 2000. Its title track was a top 5 hit for him on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country charts, and the album produced two more Top 30 hits. Davidson was later transferred to [[Capitol Records]] Nashville after Virgin Nashville's lineup was merged into Capitol, although he did not record anything for Capitol and was soon dropped. To date, ''Unconditional'' remains his only studio album.\n\n==Biography==\nClay Davidson was born in [[Saltville, Virginia]] to a musical family.
