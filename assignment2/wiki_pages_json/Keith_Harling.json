He made his debut in 1998 with the album ''Write It in Stone'', issued on the [[Universal Music Group Nashville|MCA Nashville]] label. It produced four singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now [[Hot Country Songs]]) charts. A second album, ''Bring It On'', was issued a year later on the [[Giant Records (Warner Bros. subsidiary label)|Giant Records]] label.\n\n==Biography==\nHarling was born in [[Greenwood, South Carolina]]. His family moved to [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]] when he was still young.<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p291311|pure_url=yes}} |title=Keith Harling biography |accessdate=September 14, 2007 |last=Ankeny |first=Jason |work=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> At age ten, Harling constructed a drum kit, which he taught himself how to play; he also developed his musical style through impersonation of songs that he saw on television.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> Later on, when in high school, Harling also learned to play bass guitar, saxophone, and trumpet, all of which he played in several bands.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/>\n\nHe initially moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], only to return to Chattanooga after failing to make himself known in Nashville.<ref name=\"oldies\"/> By 1996, however, he returned to Nashville, where he soon found work as a songwriter for [[MCA Nashville Records]].<ref name=\"oldies\"/> After only six weeks as a session songwriter, he was also signed to a record deal. In 1998, Harling's debut album, ''Write It in Stone'', was released.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> Consisting mostly of songs co-written by Harling, his debut album produced two Top 40 entries on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Singles & Tracks]] charts in \"Papa Bear\" and \"Coming Back for You\", but additional singles proved less successful.\n\nHaving been dropped from MCA Nashville's roster in early 1999, Harling later signed to [[Giant Records (Warner Bros. subsidiary label)|Giant Records]], releasing his second album ''Bring It On'' that year. On his second album, however, Harling was persuaded to record mostly other writers' material instead of his own.<ref name=\"oldies\"/> The album's only official single, which was the title track, peaked at No.&nbsp;52. Another selection from the album, \"Santa's Got a Semi\", charted in both 2000 and 2001 as a Christmas single before Harling exited Giant as well. Keith is currently living in the Chattanooga, Tn. area operating a small business with his wife\n\n==Discography==\n===Albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:12em;\"| Title\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:20em;\"| Album details\n! colspan=\"2\"| Peak chart<br />positions\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n! width=\"45\"| [[Top Country Albums|US Country]]<br><ref name=\"Country Albums\">{{cite magazine|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=keith harling|chart=Country Albums C}}|title=Keith Harling Album & Song Chart History – Country Albums|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|accessdate=December 11, 2010}}</ref>\n! width=\"45\"| [[Top Heatseekers|US Heat]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[Write It in Stone]]''\n| \n* Release date: May 19, 1998\n* Label: [[Universal Music Group Nashville|MCA Nashville]]\n| 56\n| 48\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[Bring It On (Keith Harling album)|Bring It On]]''\n| \n* Release date: November 23, 1999\n* Label: [[Giant Records (Warner Bros. subsidiary label)|Giant Records]]\n| —\n| —\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" style=\"font-size:8pt\"| \"—\" denotes releases that did not chart\n|-\n|}\n\n===Singles===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Year\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:16em;\"| Single\n! colspan=\"2\"| Peak chart<br />positions\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Album\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n! width=\"45\"| [[Hot Country Songs|US Country]]<br><ref name=\"Country Songs\">{{cite magazine|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=keith harling|chart=Country Songs}}|title=Keith Harling Album & Song Chart History – Country Songs|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|accessdate=December 11, 2010}}</ref>\n! width=\"45\"| [[RPM (magazine)|CAN Country]]<br><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-110.01-e.php?PHPSESSID=mfstfhcbgmru3ti1dqs7m84283&q1=keith+harling&q2=Country+Singles&interval=20|title=Results – RPM – Library and Archives Canada – Country Singles|work=[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]|accessdate=December 11, 2010}}</ref>\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 1998\n! scope=\"row\"| \"[[Papa Bear (song)|Papa Bear]]\"\n| 24\n| 26\n| align=\"left\" rowspan=\"4\"| ''Write It in Stone''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"[[Coming Back for You]]\"\n| 39\n| 58\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\"| 1999\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Write It in Stone\"\n| 61\n| 66\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"There Goes the Neighborhood\"\n| 58\n| —\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Bring It On\"\n| 52\n| —\n| align=\"left\"| ''Bring It On''\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" style=\"font-size:8pt\"| \"—\" denotes releases that did not chart\n|-\n|}\n\n===Other charted songs===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Year\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:16em;\"| Single\n! colspan=\"1\"| Peak positions\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Album\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n! width=\"65\"| [[Hot Country Songs|US Country]]\n|-\n| 2000\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Santa's Got a Semi\"\n| 60\n| align=\"left\" rowspan=\"2\"| ''Bring It On''\n|-\n| 2001\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Santa's Got a Semi\" <small>(re-entry)</small>\n| 60\n|}\n\n===Music videos===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n!
