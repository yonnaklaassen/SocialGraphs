Strayer plays [[banjo]], [[dobro]], guitar, lap steel, [[Upright bass|bass]], [[mandolin]], [[accordion]], [[fiddle]], [[piano]], and [[sitar]]. Initially in her career with the Chicks, she limited her singing to harmony with backing vocals, but within her role in the [[Court Yard Hounds (band)|Court Yard Hounds]], she took on the role of lead vocalist.\n\n==Early life==\n\nEmily Erwin was born in [[Pittsfield, Massachusetts]]. Parents Paul Erwin and Barbara Trask moved the family to the suburban town of [[Addison, Texas]], on the northern edge of [[Dallas]], where she was raised with her two older sisters, Julia and [[Martie Maguire|Martha]]. Her parents were both educators and nurtured the growing interest that both Emily and Martha (later nicknamed Martie) shared, and together both sisters became proficient on several instruments while in elementary school.\n\nEmily began playing the violin at age seven, and the [[banjo]] at age ten, afterward learning all the [[string instruments]] she could find.<ref name=\"Malkin\">Malkin, Nina [http://chickoholic.tripod.com/DixieChicks/id8.html \"A Little About Martie\"], Dixie Chicks Henhouse (Retrieved December 31, 2007).</ref> Years later, Martie joked that Emily was better than she at the fiddle, and because she wanted to keep the fiddle as her instrument, she forced Emily to learn something else.<ref>{{cite video | title=[[Dixie Chicks: Shut Up and Sing]] |date=2006 | medium=Motion picture |publisher=[[The Weinstein Company]]}}</ref> Emily responded by mastering the five string banjo, by reading books to teach herself the [[chord progressions]].<ref name=\"Malkin\"/>\n\nFrom 1984–1989, Jane Frost (Director of the [[Patsy Montana|Patsy Montana Museum]] and the [[Walnut Valley Festival]] in [[Winfield, Kansas]]) remembers watching the sisters mature, teaming up with schoolmates Troy and [[Sharon Gilchrist]]. The foursome were touring in a teenage [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] group they named the Blue Night Express, in part because of the amount of traveling they had to do to reach far away festivals, frequently with a parent or friend of the family towing them back home long after dark at night. They thought it was worth the sacrifices to meet their musical heroes and experienced the friendly camaraderie and tricks of the trade on instruments from others. The sisters were said to have an \"almost obsessive\" interest in [[busking]] at small venues and attending bluegrass festivals.<ref name=Frost>{{cite web|last1=Frost|first1=Jane|title=Walnut Valley Festival in Winfield, KS, Early 1980s|url=http://www.dixie-chicks.com/stories.shtml|website=The All-Inclusive Dixie Chicks Page|date=July 15, 1999|access-date=December 13, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151002233114/http://www.dixie-chicks.com/stories.shtml|archive-date=October 2, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Faraway Hills\">[http://homepage.ntlworld.com/farawayhills/sharon_gilchrist.html \"Sharon Gilchrist\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303182257/http://homepage.ntlworld.com/farawayhills/sharon_gilchrist.html |date=March 3, 2016 }}, Faraway Hills (Retrieved February 12, 2008).</ref> After Martie graduated from secondary school at [[Greenhill School (Addison, Texas)|Greenhill School]] with Emily still completing her studies, both remained active in the bluegrass scene.\n\n==The Chicks==\n[[File:Emily Robison with the Dixie Chicks 1998.jpg|thumb|200px|left|With the Dixie Chicks; 1998]]\n\nIn 1989, after years of attending [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] [[festivals]] and [[busking]] where they could, Emily joined her sister Martie, guitarist Robin Lynn Macy, and [[upright bass]] player [[Laura Lynch (musician)|Laura Lynch]]. Frost, again, recalls being privy to the discussion that the four women had about the possibility of a successful career as musicians together. Martie felt they could do well. Robin said, \".. It's going to be a 'hot' band,\" to which Emily responded, \"I give it six months, and if we aren't making money by then, I'm out of here!\".<ref name=\"Frost\" /> Strayer was shy, and the youngest member of the group. She had enjoyed playing throughout school, but was at an age where she was already entertaining thoughts of working hard to be accepted by the [[United States Air Force Academy]].<ref name=\"Clark\">Clark, Renee [http://www.dixie-chicks.com/dlife392.shtml \"Can the Dixie Chicks make it in the big time?\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304191833/http://www.dixie-chicks.com/dlife392.shtml |date=March 4, 2016 }} ''Dallas Life Magazine'' in ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'', March 1, 1992 (Retrieved January 23, 2008).</ref>\n\nBy 1993, the band had evolved into a new direction. Macy left the group for a \"purer\" [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] sound. Lynch, thrust into the position of sole lead singer, was replaced by the sisters in 1995 with singer composer [[Natalie Maines]] after the group was unable to garner anything more than local interest.<ref name=\"Dickerson\">Dickerson, James L. (2000) ''Dixie Chicks: Down-Home and Backstage''. Taylor Trade Publishing, Dallas, Texas. {{ISBN|0-87833-189-1}}.</ref> Strayer commented, \"We were prepared to pay our dues for as long as it took; we were prepared for longevity. We know that we will always be playing music together, so we wanted to find someone who is just as determined and energetic as we are.\"{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\nBut in later interviews, the sisters revealed what many had thought for a long time: the reason Lynch was replaced was not commitment but a perceived lack of talent.  In an article in the April/May edition of ''Country Music Magazine'', Emily stated, \"We felt we needed the next calibre of singer.\"{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\n[[File:Emily-Robison.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Strayer in concert with the [[Dixie Chicks]], Austin, Texas, 2006]]\n\nFrom there, massive commercial success ensued, with their 1998 and 1999 albums ''[[Wide Open Spaces (album)|Wide Open Spaces]]'' and  ''[[Fly (Dixie Chicks album)|Fly]]'' both achieving [[diamond record]] status. Strayer was a key element of the group's look, with her hair dyed blond to match the other two at first, and then allowing it to return to her natural brunette color, and distinguishing herself visually from the other two. Strayer and Maguire's instrumental virtuosity set the Dixie Chicks apart from many other country acts, male and female. Strayer's songwriting has also been a factor in the Chicks' recording career. <!-- needs expansion, reference to particular songs -->\n\nStrayer stood by Maines when the controversy over Maines' remarks about U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] hit the newswire on the eve before the [[Iraq War]] in 2003. She was the only bandmate to realize that - while in the U.K., there was a big anti-war sentiment in the audience - back in the United States, Maines' criticism of President Bush would not be well received. Nevertheless, even when her home was trashed,{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} and plenty of editorials were predicting the end of the Dixie Chicks' successful careers in music, she remained loyal to Maines, as did her sister.\n<!-- needs expansion, reference regarding the success of the Chicks in general -->\n\n==Court Yard Hounds==\n[[File:Emily-Robison 2010.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Strayer with the [[Court Yard Hounds (band)|Court Yard Hounds]] at Antone's, [[SXSW]], March 18, 2010]]\nStrayer spent at least half of her life busking and touring nearly non-stop since high school, first with her older sister, and then with the changing lineups of the Dixie Chicks. After the bandmates celebrated their five [[Grammy Award]]s for ''[[Taking the Long Way]]'', the trio all had young children and took time out to spend with them, but Strayer was eager to return to writing and touring. When Strayer's marriage came to an end, she began expressing herself by songwriting. Some of her compositions include her feelings about the breakup with her former husband, and expected that soon, the band would resume its former schedule of writing and performing, but Natalie Maines was reluctant to do so. After four years, Strayer became \"angry and frustrated\", and in sending her new songs to her sister, conveyed her increasing disappointment.<ref name=\"All Things Considered\">{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=126554419|title=Dixie Chicks Musicians Strike Out on Their Own|last=Block|first=Melissa|date=May 6, 2010|work=[[All Things Considered]] |publisher=[[National Public Radio]]|access-date=October 3, 2010}}</ref> With Natalie Maines taking a break from music, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine announced in January 2010 that Emily and sister Martie have formed a side project called the [[Court Yard Hounds (band)|Court Yard Hounds]], with Strayer as lead vocalist.
