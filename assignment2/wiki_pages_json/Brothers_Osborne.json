Born in [[Deale, Maryland]], the duo signed a recording contract with [[Capitol Records Nashville|EMI Records Nashville]] in 2012 and began releasing music the following year. Their 2015 song \"[[Stay a Little Longer (Brothers Osborne song)|Stay a Little Longer]]\" became a top five hit on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] and [[Country Airplay]] charts, and their success led to the release of their debut studio album titled ''[[Pawn Shop (album)|Pawn Shop]]'' the same year. Since then, Brothers Osborne have released the albums ''[[Port Saint Joe (album)|Port Saint Joe]]'' (2018), ''[[Skeletons (Brothers Osborne album)|Skeletons]]'' (2020), and ''[[Brothers Osborne (album)|Brothers Osborne]]'' (2023).\n\nThe duo have since had further hits with \"[[It Ain't My Fault (Brothers Osborne song)|It Ain't My Fault]]\" (2017), \"[[Shoot Me Straight]]\" (2018), and \"[[All Night (Brothers Osborne song)|All Night]]\" (2019), and as featured artists on [[Dierks Bentley]]'s \"[[Burning Man (song)|Burning Man]]\" (2019). Along with their own songwriting, their musical success is credited to producer [[Jay Joyce]]. Artists with whom they have worked include [[David Nail]], [[Lee Ann Womack]], and [[Lucie Silvas]] (the latter of whom is John's wife). Their musical style takes influence from [[Southern rock]] and [[outlaw country]], with particular emphasis on the styles of TJ's lead vocals and John's guitar playing. The duo attracted further media attention in February 2021 when TJ [[coming out|came out]] as gay, making him the first openly gay artist on a major country music label.\n\n==History and formation==\nBrothers John Osborne (born 1982) and TJ Osborne (born 1984) were two of five children raised in [[Deale, Maryland]], a rural fishing community located along the [[Chesapeake Bay]].<ref name=\"whitburn\">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2017|publisher=Record Research, Inc|year=2017|page=56|isbn=978-0-89820-229-8}}</ref><ref name=\"The Boot\">{{cite web |last1=Allers |first1=Hannahlee |title=Brothers Osborne Talk Childhood in Maryland |url=https://theboot.com/brothers-osborne-maryland/ |website=The Boot |date=September 21, 2014 |access-date=March 3, 2021}}</ref> In addition to their parents, who both wrote and played music regularly, their uncles and cousins also pursued musical hobbies.
