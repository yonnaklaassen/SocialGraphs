He began playing in a band with his brothers at age 12, and continued playing with two of them, George and Jerry, as the Rose City Swingsters. The trio played local radio shows, and gigs at dance halls.  Gimble later moved to [[Louisiana]] and began performing with the [[Jimmie Davis]] gubernatorial campaign. He was offered a job in the Governor's administration but turned it down to volunteer for service in the U.S. Army.  Gimble returned to Texas after completing his service in the U.S. Army in [[World War II]].\n\nBack in Texas, Gimble continued to hone his fiddling skills with a number of Texas radio and dance bands. In 1948, he made his first recording, playing with Robert Brother's Rhythmairs in [[Corpus Christi, Texas|Corpus Christi]]. A year later he joined [[Bob Wills]] and His [[Texas Playboys]], with whom he toured for most of the next decade.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> With Wills, he played both fiddle and electric [[mandolin]], and distinguished himself by using a five-string fiddle (most fiddles have four strings).<ref name=\"Litweiler\">{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Johnny-Gimble |title=Johnny Gimble: American Musician |last=Litweiler |first=John |date=May 26, 2015 |publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica |access-date=16 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nHis fiddling style was influenced by other Texas fiddlers who played the \"breakdown\" fiddle tunes. Gimble's fiddling style, while uniquely his own, came to be known as the \"Texas fiddling style\" that emerged during the first half of the twentieth century among fiddlers such as [[Cliff Bruner]], Louis Tierney, and Jesse Ashlock. Gimble learned from them, and further developed while playing with Wills, who epitomized and promoted a new sound known as Western swing. Western swing rose to national prominence in the 1940s, combining the old-time, Southern-derived Anglo string band tradition, with its breakdowns, schottisches, waltzes, and reels, with the big band jazz and pop music of the day.\n\nAfter Gimble married Barbara Kemp of [[Gatesville, Texas]], in 1949, he settled in [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], where, in the early 1950s, he began doing radio and television shows with Bill and Jim Boyd (of the Lone Star Cowboys) and performed on The ''Big D Jamboree'', a weekly variety show broadcast live from the [[Dallas Sportatorium]]. He broke off to form his own group in 1951, performing as the house band at Wills's clubs in [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]] and [[Oklahoma City]], but rejoined in 1953 and continued to play with Wills until the early 1960s. He played fiddle on [[Marty Robbins|Marty Robbins']] No. 1 hit \"[[I'll Go on Alone]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Marty-Robbins-The-Essential-Marty-Robbins-1951-1982/release/878318 |title=Marty Robbins - The Essential Marty Robbins 1951-1982 (CD) |website=Discogs.com |access-date=2015-05-22}}</ref>\n\nIn 1955, Gimble moved to [[Waco, Texas]], and split time between running a [[barber]] shop near the regional VA Hospital and music.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> In 1960, he quit touring with Bob Wills and hosted one of the first locally produced television shows on [[KWTX-TV|KWTX]], ''Johnny Gimble & the Homefolks''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kwtx.com/content/news/Legendary-fiddler-who-once-hosted-KWTX-show-joins-Country-Hall-of-Fame-478202733.html |title=Legendary fiddler who once hosted KWTX show joins Country Hall of Fame |last=Shadrock |first=Christopher |date=March 28, 2018 |website=Kwtx.com |publisher=KWTX-TV |access-date=15 September 2018}}</ref> Gimble's show featured a young bass player from nearby [[Abbott, Texas]], named [[Willie Nelson]], and a lifetime friendship and partnership was born.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/legendary-fiddle-player-johnny-gimble-dead-at-88-189259/ |title=Legendary Fiddle Player Johnny Gimble Dead at 88 |last=Betts |first=Stephen L. |date=May 11, 2015 |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |access-date=15 September 2018}}</ref> In 1968, after repeated encouragement from his peers, Gimble moved his family to [[Nashville, Tennessee]].
