Signed to [[Curb Records]] in 1996, he charted his first single on the ''Billboard'' country chart in 1997, but did not release an album until 2003's ''[[Honesty (Rodney Atkins album)|Honesty]]'', which included the hit single \"[[Honesty (Write Me a List)]]\".\n\n''[[If You're Going Through Hell]]'', his second album, was released in 2006. Its first two singles, \"[[If You're Going Through Hell (Before the Devil Even Knows)]]\" and \"[[Watching You (Rodney Atkins song)|Watching You]]\", each spent four weeks at number one the country music chart, and were respectively ranked as the top country songs of 2006 and 2007 according to [[Billboard Year-End]]. The album, which has since been certified platinum in the United States, produced two more number one singles in \"[[These Are My People]]\" and \"[[Cleaning This Gun (Come On In Boy)]]\". ''[[It's America]]'' (2009) included the number one single \"[[It's America (song)|It's America]]\" and the Top 5 hit \"[[Farmer's Daughter (Rodney Atkins song)|Farmer's Daughter]]\", which was added to a later reissue of the album. ''[[Take a Back Road]]'' (2011) produced his sixth number one in its [[Take a Back Road (song)|title track]], and 2019's ''[[Caught Up in the Country]]'' set a record for the longest run on the country singles charts with its [[Caught Up in the Country (song)|title track]]. Atkins has received six nominations from the [[Academy of Country Music]] and two from the [[Country Music Association]], winning Top New Male Vocalist from the former in 2006.\n\n==Early life==\nRodney Allan Atkins was born March 28, 1969, in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]].
