He made his debut in 2001 with the single \"[[Mrs. Steven Rudy]]\", a Top 10 hit on the U.S. ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Singles & Tracks]] charts. It was the first of three singles from his first album ''Mark McGuinn'', which was released in 2001 on the independent VFR Records label. The label was closed in 2002, and McGuinn did not a record another album until ''One Man's Crazy'' in 2006, released on Blue Flamingo Records. He has not recorded an album since then.\n\n==Biography==\nMcGuinn was born in [[Greensboro, North Carolina]]. His musical background includes playing trumpet in a jazz band.<ref name=\"dark\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1443637/dark-horse-mcguinn-hits-with-mrs-steven-rudy.jhtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022172043/http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1443637/dark-horse-mcguinn-hits-with-mrs-steven-rudy.jhtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=October 22, 2012 |title=Dark Horse McGuinn Hits with \"Mrs. Steven Rudy\" |accessdate=December 14, 2007 |last=Zhito |first=Lisa |date=April 9, 2001 |work=CMT.com}}</ref> McGuinn later aspired to become a professional soccer player.

After a disc jockey at [[KPLX]] in [[Dallas]], Texas, began playing \"Mrs. Steven Rudy\", another track from the album, other nearby stations soon followed suit.
