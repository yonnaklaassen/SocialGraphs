They met through a common friend, with whom they initially performed as a trio before deciding to work as a duo instead after the trio split up.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/>\n\nThe duo released a self-titled studio album and two singles in 1999 on [[DreamWorks Records]].<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p376046/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Redmon & Vale biography |accessdate=2008-07-24 |last=Ankeny |first=Jason |work=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> The album included two singles, both of which charted on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country charts. Jeffrey B.
