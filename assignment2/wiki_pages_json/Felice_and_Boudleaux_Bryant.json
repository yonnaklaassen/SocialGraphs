He trained as a classical violinist. Although he performed with the [[Atlanta Symphony Orchestra|Atlanta Philharmonic Orchestra]] during its 1937–38 season, he had more interest in country fiddling.

They tried to sell their compositions to a number of country music artists but were either ignored or rejected until [[Little Jimmy Dickens]] recorded their song \"Country Boy.\" It went to No. 7 on the country chart in 1948 and opened the door to a working relationship with [[Fred Rose (songwriter)|Fred Rose]] at [[Acuff-Rose Music]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]].\n\nIn 1950, the Bryants moved to Nashville to work full-time at songwriting. Some of their compositions from the early 1950s included the swinging \"Sugar Beet\" (recorded by [[Moon Mullican]]) and the bluesy \"Midnight\" (recorded by [[Red Foley]]).\n\nThe Bryants wrote more songs for Dickens as well as for country artist [[Carl Smith (country musician)|Carl Smith]]. At the same time, they released four 45-rpm singles of their own to modest success.\n\nBeginning in 1957, the Bryants came to national prominence in both country and pop music when they wrote a string of very successful songs for [[the Everly Brothers]]<ref name=pc9>{{Gilliland |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19757/m1/ |title=Show 9 – Tennessee Firebird: American country music before and after Elvis.
