Although not a huge chart success, he was an inspiration to such artists as [[Buck Owens]], [[Merle Haggard]] and [[Nick Lowe]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life and rise to fame===\n[[File:Wynn Stewart.png|thumb|right|Stewart in 1970]]\nStewart was born in [[Morrisville, Missouri|Morrisville]], Missouri, United States,<ref name=\"Larkin50\"/> in 1934, during the [[Great Depression|Depression]]. He spent most of his childhood moving around the country with his [[sharecropping]] family. After [[World War II]], Stewart spent a year working at [[KWTO (AM)|KWTO]] in [[Springfield, Missouri|Springfield]], Missouri.<ref name=\"Larkin50\"/> In 1948, he moved to California with his family. Stewart originally wanted to become a professional baseball player, but suffered from a hand disease and was also too short to play professional baseball.<ref name=\"Larkin50\"/> In high school, Stewart formed a band that played at clubs around California. He soon met [[steel guitar]]ist [[Ralph Mooney]], who joined Stewart's band.<ref name=\"Larkin50\"/> The group's lineup consisted of guitarist [[Roy Nichols]] and bassist [[Bobby Austin (musician)|Bobby Austin]].\n\nIn 1954, Stewart signed a recording contract with an independent record label called [[Intro Records]].<ref name=\"Larkin50\"/> He released two singles on Intro. The first was called \"I've Waited a Lifetime\" and the second was \"Strolling\". Both failed to reach on the country music chart. His second single caught the attention of [[Skeets McDonald]], one of Stewart's idols. He liked the song so much, he arranged an audition with [[Capitol Records]] for Stewart. By the summer of 1956, Stewart signed with Capitol.<ref name=\"Larkin50\"/> He soon recorded and released his first single from the label, \"Waltz of the Angels\", that same year.<ref name=\"Larkin50\"/> The song went to No. 14 on the country chart, and gave Stewart his first major hit. The song later became a duet hit for [[George Jones]] and [[Margie Singleton]]. However, Stewart did not stay with Capitol much longer as none of his other singles was gaining much success. His last single for Capitol (until his 1960s return) was called \"I Wish I Could Stay the Same\", released in September 1957.\n\n=== Nightclub owner===\nStewart was part owner of a [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], Nevada, nightclub called Nashville Nevada during the early 1960s.<ref name=\"Larkin50\"/> He performed there six nights a week and also hosted his own television show. A young [[Merle Haggard]] sat in with the band while Stewart was out of town in 1962. Stewart returned early, was impressed with Haggard's performance, and hired him as his regular bass player. He wrote Haggard's first hit \"Sing a Sad Song\".<ref name=\"Larkin50\"/>\n\n\"Wynn's sound was what influenced Buck and me both,\" Haggard has said, \"and in a strange twist of fate, his band was the heart of the old Frizzell band – Roy Nichols was part of the Lefty band, and he went to Wynn Stewart and ran into Ralph Mooney, who played the steel, and they were the basis of the modern West Coast sound.\"{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n===Height of his career===\nWith the help of songwriter [[Harlan Howard]], Stewart signed with Jackpot Records, a subsidiary label of [[Challenge Records (1950s)|Challenge Records]], in 1958. He recorded a string of singles that were a mix of different styles, ranging from pop to [[rockabilly]]. In 1959, he moved to the parent Challenge label and released a single called \"Wishful Thinking\".<ref name=\"Larkin50\"/> The song proved a breakthrough for Stewart when it reached No. 5 in 1960. Following the song's success, Stewart moved to [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], Nevada, where he hosted a local TV show and was part owner of a nightclub, The Nashville Nevada.<ref name=\"Larkin50\"/>\n\nStewart continued to have sizable hits, including the [[Jan Howard]] duet called \"[[Wrong Company]]\", and \"Big, Big Love\", among others. Stewart moved back to the center of the Bakersfield sound, California, in 1965. He re-signed with Capitol. [[Cliffie Stone]], who was an A & R director with Capitol introduced Wynn to a young arranger-guitarist Bill Aken (Zane Ashton) who would often over-dub unique guitar parts on Wynn's recordings. His first couple of singles for the label proved unsuccessful once again for Stewart, but his fifth single was a different story. \"[[It's Such a Pretty World Today]]\" was released in 1967 and became the biggest hit of his career.<ref name=\"Larkin50\"/> The song went to No. 1 on the country music chart and spent two weeks there. It was also the country music Song of the Year and a Gold record. Its follow-up, \"Cause I Have You\", was a Top 10 hit in 1967. Following his singles' success, Stewart recorded more soft, pop-friendly material, which gave Stewart his biggest hits into the 1970s.\n\nBy 1972, Stewart moved to [[RCA Records]] with \"Paint Me a Rainbow\" being his biggest hit for the label. He also briefly signed with [[Atlantic Records]] in 1974. Over the next three years, Stewart released singles but did not break the country Top 40. In 1975, he signed with [[Playboy Records]] and managed a Top 10 hit in 1976 called \"After The Storm\". Although he stayed with Playboy, he only had one other big hit, his version of \"Sing a Sad Song\", which went to No. 19 in 1977.<ref name=\"Larkin50\"/>\n\n===Later career and death===\nStewart started his own label in 1978 called WIN. His first single, \"Eyes as Big as Dallas\", broke the Top 40. Although country music was changing in the late 1970s, moving to the smooth sounds of [[country pop]], he was not able to continue to achieve success, which was hampered by his alcoholism.<ref name=\"Larkin50\"/> In the early 1980s, Stewart quit performing, but a few years on and Stewart launched a comeback, with an extensive tour and a new album.\n\nDuring the tour, Stewart suddenly died of a heart attack on July 17, 1985.<ref name=\"Larkin50\"/> Following Stewart's death, his song \"Wait 'Til I Get My Hands on You\" became a minor hit.\n\n==Commercials==\nIn 2010, [[Volkswagen]] used Stewart's song \"Another Day, Another Dollar\" in an ad for the [[Volkswagen Jetta|Jetta]]<ref name=\"vw\">{{cite web |url=http://www.popisms.com/TelevisionCommercial/22623/Volkswagen-Commercial-for-Volkswagen-Jetta-2.aspx |date=October 4, 2010 |work=Popisms.com |title=Volkswagen Commercial for Volkswagen Jetta (2010 – present) |access-date=October 7, 2010}}</ref>\n\nKmart also used one of Wynn's songs, \"It's Such a Pretty World Today\", on a Blue light special commercial.<ref name=\"kmart\">{{cite web |url=https://clip-share.net/video/rgdWzL6lev0/kmart-blue-light-commercial.html |work=clip-share.net |title=Kmart Blue Light Commercial}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n{{main|Wynn Stewart discography}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.wynnstewart.com/ Official website]\n*[{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p128752/biography|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic]\n\n{{Wynn Stewart}}\n{{Jan Howard}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Stewart, Wynn}}\n[[Category:1934 births]]\n[[Category:1985 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Polk County, Missouri]]\n[[Category:American country singer-songwriters]]\n[[Category:American male singer-songwriters]]\n[[Category:Apex Records artists]]\n[[Category:Capitol Records artists]]\n[[Category:Challenge Records artists]]\n[[Category:Playboy Records artists]]\n[[Category:Bakersfield sound]]\n[[Category:20th-century American singer-songwriters]]\n[[Category:Singer-songwriters from Missouri]]\n[[Category:Country musicians from Missouri]]\n[[Category:20th-century American male singers]]"
