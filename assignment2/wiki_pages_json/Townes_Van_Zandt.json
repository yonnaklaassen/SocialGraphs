His musical style has often been described as melancholic and features rich, poetic lyrics. During his early years, Van Zandt was respected for his guitar playing and [[Fingerstyle guitar|fingerpicking]] ability.\n\nMuch of Van Zandt's life was spent touring various bars, music clubs, colleges, and folk venues and festivals, often lodging in motel rooms or the homes of friends. He suffered from drug addiction and [[alcoholism]], and was diagnosed with [[bipolar disorder]].

That made a big impression on me.\"<ref name=\"tvzfaq\" /> In 1958, the family moved to [[Boulder, Colorado]]. Van Zandt remembered his time in Colorado fondly and often visited it as an adult. He later referred to Colorado in \"My Proud Mountains\", \"Colorado Girl\", and \"Snowin' on Raton\".

In the spring of his second year, his parents flew to Boulder to bring Townes back to Houston, worried about his binge drinking and episodes of depression.<ref name=\"tm\" /> They admitted him to the [[University of Texas Medical Branch]] in Galveston, where he was diagnosed with manic depression. He received three months of [[insulin shock therapy]], which erased much of his [[long-term memory]].<ref name=\"townesvanzandt.com\" /><ref name=\"tm\" /> Afterwards, his mother said that her \"biggest regret in life was that she had allowed that treatment to occur\".<ref name=\"JTVZ\">{{YouTube|2t_X9WXvF5E|\"J.T.

His repertoire consisted mostly of covers of songs written by Hopkins, [[Bob Dylan]], and others, as well as original novelty songs like \"Fraternity Blues.\"<ref name=\"deeperblue60\">{{harvnb|Hardy|2008|p=60}}</ref> In 1966, Harris Van Zandt had encouraged his son to stop playing covers and write his own songs.<ref name=\"deeperblue212\">{{harvnb|Hardy|2008|p=212}}</ref>\n\nAt one point around 1968, Van Zandt was roommates with [[13th Floor Elevators]] singer [[Roky Erickson]]. Erickson suggested that he audition as  the Elevators' new bassist, even though he was a guitarist who had never played bass before. When Tommy Hall found  out he never played bass, he kicked him out of the audition.\n\nIn 1968, Van Zandt met songwriter [[Mickey Newbury]] in a Houston coffee shop. Newbury persuaded Van Zandt to go to Nashville, Tennessee, where he was introduced by Newbury to the man who became his longtime producer, [[Jack Clement|\"Cowboy\" Jack Clement]].\n\nVan Zandt cited Lightnin' Hopkins, Bob Dylan, and Hank Williams and such varied artists as [[Muddy Waters]], [[The Rolling Stones]], [[Blind Willie McTell]], [[Tchaikovsky]], and [[Jefferson Airplane]] as having had a major impact on his music.<ref name=\"tvzfaq\" />\n\n=== 1970s ===\nThe years between 1968 and 1973 proved to be his most prolific era.<ref name=\"allmusic\" /> Van Zandt released six albums during the time period: ''[[For the Sake of the Song]]'', ''[[Our Mother the Mountain]]'', ''[[Townes Van Zandt (album)|Townes Van Zandt]]'', ''[[Delta Momma Blues]]'', ''[[High, Low and In Between]]'', and ''[[The Late Great Townes Van Zandt]]''. Among the tracks written for these albums were \"To Live Is to Fly\", \"[[Pancho and Lefty]]\", and \"[[If I Needed You]]\". These songs eventually raised Van Zandt to near-legend status in American and European songwriting circles.<ref name=\"allmusic\" />\n\nIn 1972, he recorded tracks for an album with a working title of ''Seven Come Eleven'', which remained unreleased for many years due to a dispute between his manager Kevin Eggers and producer Jack Clement. Eggers either could not or refused to pay for the studio sessions, so Clement erased the master tapes. However, before they were deleted, Eggers sneaked into the studio and recorded rough mixes of the songs on to a [[cassette tape]]. Tracks from the aborted ''Seven Come Eleven'' debacle later surfaced on ''The Nashville Sessions''.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nIn 1975, Van Zandt was featured prominently in the documentary film ''[[Heartworn Highways]]'' with [[Guy Clark]], [[Steve Earle]], [[Steve Young (musician)|Steve Young]], [[Gamble Rogers]], [[Charlie Daniels]] and [[David Allan Coe]]. His segment of the film was shot at his run-down trailer home in Austin, Texas, where Van Zandt is shown drinking straight whiskey during the middle of the day, shooting and playing with guns, and performing the songs \"Waitin' Around to Die\" and \"Pancho and Lefty.\"<ref name=\"Heartworn Highways\">[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0405963 ''Heartworn Highways'' profile], imdb.com; accessed July 1, 2015.</ref> His soon-to-be second wife Cindy and dog Geraldine (a large, \"keenly intelligent\" half-wolf, half-husky) are featured in the film.<ref name=\"dallasmusic\">[http://www.dallasobserver.com/2002-10-24/music/the-way-of-the-gun \"The Way of the Gun – Living up to his famous father is a tall order for J.T.

Some of the letters described how his material often served as a crutch for those who were dealing with depression.<ref name=\"utr\" /> In 1978, the singer fired Lomax and re-hired Eggers. He soon signed with Eggers' new label, [[Tomato Records]].<ref name=\"allmusic\" /> The following year, he recorded ''[[Flyin' Shoes]]''; he did not release another album until 1987's ''[[At My Window (album)|At My Window]]''. Despite critical acclaim, he remained a cult figure. He normally played small venues (often to crowds of fewer than fifty people) but began to move towards playing larger venues (and even made a handful of television appearances) during the 1990s. For much of the 1970s, he lived a reclusive life outside of Nashville in a tin-roofed, bare-boards shack with no heat, plumbing or telephone, occasionally appearing in town to play shows.<ref name=\"dallasmusic\" />\n\n=== 1980s–1990s ===\nSeveral of Van Zandt's compositions were recorded by other artists, such as [[Emmylou Harris]] who, with [[Don Williams]], had a No. 3 country hit in 1981 with \"[[If I Needed You]],\" and [[Willie Nelson]] and [[Merle Haggard]], the pair taking \"Pancho and Lefty\" to No. 1 on the country charts in 1983. Van Zandt had a small cameo appearance in the video for the song. In his later years, he recorded less frequently, his voice and singing style altered in part because of his drug addiction and alcoholism. However, he continued writing songs, such as \"Marie\" and \"The Hole\".{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nAccording to Susanna Clark, Van Zandt turned down repeated invitations to write with Bob Dylan.<ref name=\"deeperblue203\">{{harvnb|Hardy|2008|p=203}}</ref> Dylan was reportedly a \"big fan\" of Townes and claimed to have all of his records; Van Zandt admired Dylan's songs, but didn't care for his celebrity.<ref name=\"deeperblue203\" /> The two first met during a chance encounter outside a costume shop in the [[South Congress]] district of Austin, on June 21, 1986.<ref name=\"deeperblue203\" /> According to Johnny Guess, Dylan later arranged another meeting with the songwriter. The [[Drag (Austin, Texas)|Drag]] in Austin was shut down due to Dylan being in town; Van Zandt drove his [[motorhome]] to the cordoned-off area, after which Dylan boarded the vehicle and requested to hear him play several songs.<ref>''[[Be Here to Love Me]]'' DVD bonus feature: Johnny Guess interview.</ref> In May and June 1990, he opened for the [[Cowboy Junkies]] during a two-month-long tour of the United States and Canada, which exposed him to a younger generation of fans.<ref name=\"tvzfaq\" /> As a result, he wrote the song \"Cowboy Junkies Lament\" for the group, with a verse about each member of the band.<ref name=\"deeperblue216\" />\n\n== Personal life ==\n=== Relationships ===\nVan Zandt married Fran Peterson on August 26, 1965; a son, John Townes \"J.T.\" Van Zandt II, was born to them on April 11, 1969, in Houston.

They had no children.<ref name=\"tvzfaq\" />\n\nVan Zandt's third marriage was to Jeanene Munsell. They met on December 9, 1980, at a memorial for [[John Lennon]]. When Townes' terminally-ill mother learned that he had impregnated Munsell, she told him, \"You're going to do the right thing and honor that baby.\"<ref name=\"deeperblue190\">{{harvnb|Hardy|2008|p=190}}</ref> He divorced his estranged second wife and married Munsell on March 14, 1983.
