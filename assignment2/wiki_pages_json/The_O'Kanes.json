O'Hara (August 8, 1950-January 7, 2021) was born and raised in [[Toledo, Ohio]], and initially sought to play [[American football]] until an injury forced him to pursue a musical career as well.<ref name=\"jamie allmusic\">{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/jamie-ohara-mn0000176154/biography | title=Jamie O'Hara biography | publisher=AllMusic | accessdate=March 26, 2023 | author=Johnny Loftus}}</ref> He supported himself by performing at various [[nightclub]]s throughout the [[Midwestern United States]] until also moving to Nashville by the end of the 1970s.<ref name=\"okanes allmusic\"/>\n\nThe two songwriters met for the first time when both had publishing contracts with [[Tree International Publishing]] in Nashville. At the time, O'Hara had success with the songs \"[[Older Women]]\" and \"[[Wandering Eyes]]\", both recorded by [[Ronnie McDowell]],<ref name=\"okanes allmusic\"/> as well as \"[[Grandpa (Tell Me 'Bout the Good Old Days)]]\" by [[The Judds]].<ref name=\"hurst\"/> Inspired by the success of these songs, O'Hara chose to write with Kane after the two met each other and realized they worked for the same company. One of their collaborations, \"Bluegrass Blues\", was recorded by both the Judds and [[Southern Pacific (band)|Southern Pacific]]. The two of them then decided to record [[demo (music)|demo]]s of their collaborative songs. Initially, they did not intend to become an official performing act, but ultimately chose to do so after both of them reacted favorably to the sound of their recordings.<ref name=\"hurst\"/>\n\n===Musical career===\nO'Hara and Kane began performing together as The O'Kanes in 1986.<ref name=\"LarkinGE\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1992|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-939-0|page=1856}}</ref> That same year, the duo signed to [[Columbia Records]] Nashville and released their [[The O'Kanes (album)|self-titled debut album]], which consisted entirely of their original demo recordings. According to Kane, record executives insisted on letting the duo sing, write, and produce entirely by themselves, so that the recording could be satisfactory to the both of them.<ref name=\"hurst\"/> ''The O'Kanes'' charted four singles on ''Billboard'' Hot Country Songs between 1986 and 1987. These were  \"[[Oh Darlin' (Why Don't You Care for Me No More)]]\", \"[[Can't Stop My Heart from Loving You]]\", \"[[Daddies Need to Grow Up Too]]\", and \"[[Just Lovin' You]]\".
