Like his debut album, ''Between Now and Forever'' was certified platinum. That same year, [[Diamond Rio]] charted in the Top 5 with \"Imagine That\", which White co-wrote with Derek George and John Tirro.\n\n===''The Right Place''===\n''[[The Right Place]]'' followed in 1997. Its title track, \"[[Love Is the Right Place]]\", was a Top 5 hit, although later singles proved less successful. \"One Small Miracle\" peaked at 15, and \"Bad Day to Let You Go\" peaked in at 30 in 1998. The album earned a gold certification. Also in 1998, White contributed background vocals and made a guest appearance on [[Shania Twain]]'s Top Ten country and pop hit \"[[From This Moment On (Shania Twain song)|From This Moment On]]\" released on Shania's 1997 album [[Come On Over (Shania Twain album)|Come On Over]], there are several edits of the song, both country and pop.

Session guitarist and producer [[Dann Huff]] produced half of the album, and White co-produced the rest with Derek George.<ref>{{cite AV media notes |title=How Lucky I Am |others=Bryan White |year=1999 |type=CD booklet |publisher=Asylum Records |id=62278}}</ref> Both of its singles (\"You're Still Beautiful To Me\" and \"God Gave Me You\") were top 30 singles.

WB issued a ''[[Greatest Hits (Bryan White album)|Greatest Hits]]'' album in 2000 on [[Warner Bros. Records]]. This album included the number 56 single \"How Long\".\n\nWhite's 1999/2000 single \"God Gave Me You\" from the album ''How Lucky I Am'' became a massive hit in the Philippines 16 years after it was released due to its use of the [[AlDub]] love-team phenomenon which was vocally dubbed by [[Alden Richards]] and [[Maine Mendoza]] on the ''[[Kalyeserye]]'' segment of the noontime TV variety show ''[[Eat Bulaga!]]''. The success of this song prompted White to visit the Philippines for the first time to perform a concert at the [[Smart Araneta Coliseum]] on December 1, 2015.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Villano |first=Alexa |date=4 December 2015 |title=IN PHOTOS: Bryan White serenades PH crowd, thanks #AlDub fans for unforgettable night |no-pp=y |work=Rappler |url=https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/music/114690-bryan-white-manila-concert-aldub/ |access-date=21 May 2022}}</ref> White also performed the song on ''Eat Bulaga!''<ref>{{Cite web |date=28 November 2015 |title=BRYAN WHITE SINGS GOD GAVE ME YOU!

He also visited the Catmon community in Manila with [[Food for the Hungry]].\n\n===2000s===\nBeing so young in the 1990s and thrust into stardom so fast, White found that the industry's pressures ended up taking their toll. As White has stated, \"I found myself being defined by my career and success and being pushed farther away from who I really was meant to be\". With his fourth album being less commercially successful, he began doubting himself and his voice which landed him in a deep depression, forcing him to take some time off until 2005, when he began work on another album. A second Christmas EP, ''My Christmas Project'', followed in 2006.\n\nA new album, ''Dustbowl Dreams'', was released on September 28, 2009.  White released a new single from that album, \"The Little Things\", in July 2009. White said, \"It was a record that I had to make. It's my most personal to date. \"Dustbowl Dreams\" was for my healing..\"\n\n===''2012 New Music Project''===\nOn September 24, 2012, White launched a [[Kickstarter]] project for a new record which he planned to create without the help of a record label.<ref>{{cite web|last=White|first=Bryan|title=New Bryan White Record|url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2039419115/new-bryan-white-record|access-date=1 October 2012}}</ref> On October 24, 2012, the [[Kickstarter]] project funding period closed. White raised $34,889 in total. On March 20, 2013, White announced to his Kickstarter backers that the album would at least include the following songs: \"Another Day In The Sun,\" \"Amen,\" \"Born To Be Somebody,\" \"Call Me Crazy,\" \"Another Man's Shoes,\" and \"What I Already Know.\" On June 17, 2013, in an update to his financial backers, White announced that the album would be called ''Shine''.\n\n==Personal life==\nWhite is married to actress [[Erika Page White]], and together they have two sons, Justin and Jackson.
