Known for her autobiographical songwriting, artistic reinventions, and [[Cultural impact of Taylor Swift|cultural impact]], Swift is a leading figure in popular music and the subject of [[Public image of Taylor Swift|widespread public interest]]. \n\nSwift signed with [[Big Machine Records]] in 2005, starting as a [[country pop]] singer with her first two albums ''[[Taylor Swift (album)|Taylor Swift]]'' (2006) and ''[[Fearless (Taylor Swift album)|Fearless]]'' (2008). Their singles \"[[Teardrops on My Guitar]]\", \"[[Love Story (Taylor Swift song)|Love Story]]\", and \"[[You Belong with Me]]\" were [[Crossover music|crossover]] successes on [[Country radio|country]] and [[Contemporary hit radio|pop]] radio formats. She experimented with [[Rock music|rock]] on ''[[Speak Now]]'' (2010) and [[Electronic music|electronic]] on ''[[Red (Taylor Swift album)|Red]]'' (2012), later recalibrating her image from country to pop music with the [[synth-pop]] album ''[[1989 (album)|1989]]'' (2014). The ensuing media scrutiny inspired the [[hip-hop]]-imbued ''[[Reputation (album)|Reputation]]'' (2017); the albums contained the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] number-one singles \"[[We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together]]\", \"[[Shake It Off]]\", \"[[Blank Space]]\", \"[[Bad Blood (Taylor Swift song)|Bad Blood]]\", and \"[[Look What You Made Me Do]]\". \n\nShifting to [[Republic Records]] in 2018, Swift released the [[electropop]] album ''[[Lover (album)|Lover]]'' (2019) and the autobiographical documentary ''[[Miss Americana]]'' (2020). She explored [[indie folk]] styles in the 2020 sister-albums ''[[Folklore (Taylor Swift album)|Folklore]]'' and ''[[Evermore]]'' and subdued pop genres on ''[[Midnights]]'' (2022) and ''[[The Tortured Poets Department]]'' (2024), while also [[Re-recording (music)|re-recording]] four of her albums under the ''[[Taylor's Version|(Taylor's Version)]]'' subtitle,{{efn|Namely, ''[[Fearless (Taylor's Version)]]'' and ''[[Red (Taylor's Version)]]'' in 2021, followed by ''[[Speak Now (Taylor's Version)]]'' and ''[[1989 (Taylor's Version)]]'' in 2023.}} after an [[Taylor Swift masters dispute|ownership dispute with Big Machine]]. The albums garnered the U.S. number one songs \"[[Cruel Summer (Taylor Swift song)|Cruel Summer]]\", \"[[Cardigan (song)|Cardigan]]\", \"[[Willow (song)|Willow]]\", \"[[All Too Well]]\", \"[[Anti-Hero (song)|Anti-Hero]]\", \"[[Is It Over Now?]]\", and \"[[Fortnight (song)|Fortnight]]\" in the 2020s. Her sixth concert tour, [[the Eras Tour]] (2023–2024), and [[Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour|its accompanying concert film]] are respectively [[List of highest-grossing concert tours|the highest-grossing tour]] and [[Concert film#Highest-grossing concert films|concert film]] of all time; Swift became the [[List of music artists by net worth|first billionaire with music]] as the main source of income and the [[List of highest-grossing live music artists|highest-grossing female touring act]].\n\nSwift is one of the [[world's best-selling music artists]] with an estimated global sale of 200 million records. Seven of [[Taylor Swift albums discography|her albums]] have opened with [[List of fastest-selling albums|over one million pure sales in a week]]. She has been listed amongst history's greatest artists by publications such as ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']], and ''[[Forbes]]'', as well as the only individual from [[the arts]] to have been named the [[Time Person of the Year|''Time'' Person of the Year]] (2023).
