The group's first album, ''When the Night Falls'', was produced by [[Reggie Fisher]] and released on LP in 1985 by Bench Records (BR-001) and reissued on CD in 1990 (BRCD-101). For the CD release the band recorded new versions of two tracks from the LP, \"Learning the Game\", a cover of the [[Buddy Holly]] song, and \"Chain Gang\", a cover of the [[Sam Cooke]] song.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Searles|first1=Malcolm|title=Bread: A Sweet Surrender|date=2014|publisher=Helter Skelter|location=London, England|isbn=978-1-905139-32-3|page=215}}</ref> These tracks were released as a single, and \"Learning the Game\" reached #59 of the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs|Hot Country Singles & Tracks]] chart.\n\nGriffin was formerly a member of the [[soft rock]] band [[Bread (band)|Bread]], and would later chart five country singles as one-third of [[The Remingtons]].

Ten tracks were released on an eponymous CD in April 2000 in Japan{{Citation needed|date=April 2023}} (2001 by Varese in the US and 2002 by Rev-Ola in the UK).
