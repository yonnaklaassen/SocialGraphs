He is a member of the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]].\n\n==Biography==\nCarlisle was born in [[Wakefield, Kentucky|Wakefield]], Kentucky southeast of [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]].  He performed in the 1920s with his older brother, [[Cliff Carlisle]], on radio stations [[WLAP|WLAP-AM]] in [[Lexington, Kentucky]], and [[WNOX|WNOX-AM]] in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]]. His first solo single and hit was the 1933 recording of \"Rattlesnake Daddy,\" released on [[ARC Records]]. That year he formed the Carlisle Brothers with Cliff, and in 1938 they signed with [[Decca Records]] and continued performing on Kentucky country radio programs. He created an [[alter ego]] for the WNOX's ''Mid-Day Merry-Go-Round'' and ''Tennessee Barn Dance'' shows called Hot Shot Elmer, a bumbling buffoon in costume who would \"interrupt\" Carlisle's own performances. His leaps on stage won him the moniker \"Jumpin' Bill.\"<ref name=\"AM\">{{cite web | last = Manheim | first = James | title = Biography of Bill Carlisle | publisher = AllMusic  | url ={{AllMusic|class=artist|id= p24147/biography|pure_url=yes}} | access-date = August 3, 2011}}</ref>\n<!-- Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:Jumpin Bill Carlisle.jpg|thumb|left|200px|\"Jumpin' Bill\" at the Grand Ole Opry]] -->\n\nCarlisle's guitar style was noted for its precision and speed, and he employed [[yodel]]ing as a vocalist. Like his brother, he released many songs which included humorous, veiled references to sexuality. The duo signed with [[King Records (USA)|King Records]] after World War II, and hit big with the [[Ernest Tubb]] cover, \"A Rainbow at Midnight\", in 1946. Carlisle had a solo hit in 1948 with \"Tramp on the Street\". Cliff retired from the business about 1950, and Bill put together a backing ensemble, The Carlisles, though none of them was related to him. Among its members were singer [[Martha Carson]] and songwriter [[Betty Amos]].<ref name=\"CMHoF\">{{cite web| title =Biography of Bill Carlisle| publisher =[[Country Music Hall of Fame]]| url =http://countrymusichalloffame.org/full-list-of-inductees/view/bill-carlisle| access-date =August 3, 2011| url-status =dead| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20111214200157/http://countrymusichalloffame.org/full-list-of-inductees/view/bill-carlisle| archive-date =December 14, 2011}}</ref>\n\nCarlisle signed with [[Mercury Records]] and continued to release [[novelty song]] hits in the 1950s, such as \"Too Old to Cut the Mustard\", a top ten country hit in 1951 later covered by artists including [[Rosemary Clooney]] and [[Marlene Dietrich]]. Other hits included the number one smash \"No Help Wanted\" (their biggest)<ref>STARK, P., 2003. Obituaries: Bill Carlisle, 94. ''Billboard'', 115(13), pp. 53.</ref> and the top ten \"Taint Nice (To Talk Like That)\", both 1953. That year the Carlisles were invited to join the [[Grand Ole Opry]]. In the mid-1950s, Carlisle was a regular performer on ABC-TV's ''[[Ozark Jubilee]]''.<ref name=\"AM\" /><ref name=\"CMHoF\" />\n\nHe also wrote the gospel song \"Gone Home,\" which has been recorded by [[Flatt & Scruggs]], [[Ricky Skaggs]], and the [[Jerry Garcia Acoustic Band]]. Carlisle said he never recorded the song himself because he \"just did so much better with the novelty stuff.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0anguFR0k |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211221/6V0anguFR0k |archive-date=2021-12-21 |url-status=live|title=Gone Home|date=December 30, 2014 |via=YouTube}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nIn 1953, Carlisle, his wife, and children, Bill Jr. (born 1942), and Sheila, moved to [[Minden, Louisiana|Minden]] in [[Webster Parish, Louisiana|Webster Parish]], Louisiana, to be near the Louisiana Hayride in [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]]. At the time [[Tillman Franks]] of Shreveport was his manager.<ref>\"Nationally Famous Folk Song Writer Moves to Minden\", ''Minden Press'', October 2, 1953, pp. 1, 16</ref>\n\nHis children became members of The Carlisles group in the 1960s; his last hit was \"What Kinda Deal Is This\", released in 1965.
