His family relocated to the [[Midland–Odessa]] area of [[West Texas]], before eventually moving to [[Houston]]. He attended high school primarily in Houston at [[Westfield High School (Harris County, Texas)|Westfield High School]].\n\nBingham's mother purchased his first guitar when he was 16 years old. Although he was fascinated by music, he left his guitar dormant in his closet. Roughly a year later, Bingham hitchhiked back west to [[Laredo, Texas]], in hopes of landing a job with his father, carrying the guitar with him on the trip. Bingham's father enjoyed having neighbors over on their porch to drink beer, and one of them taught him a classical Mariachi song called \"La Malaguena\" in segments. Though he loved playing the song, it was the only one he would learn during his time in Laredo.\n\nHe relocated to [[Stephenville, Texas]]. There, he began learning more music while also riding on the rodeo team at [[Tarleton State University]]. It was in Stephenville that he would write arguably his most well-known hit \"Southside of Heaven\" in a trailer house. He also began to play local gigs there, namely a local golf course and a few small bars.\n\nWhile in Stephenville, Bingham had a friend who caught wind of a job in [[Paris]], France, with the Wild West Show at the [[Disney Parks, Experiences and Products|Disney Resort]]. He bought a one-way ticket with $100 in his pocket. Upon arrival, he was informed that the manager with whom he had a mutual friend was no longer with the company, and he found himself stranded with his guitar and old rigging bag from his rodeo days. Luckily, he found some friends-of-friends within the Disney programs and began playing music in local parks for tips.\n\nEventually, he saved enough money to get back to Texas and moved in with a rodeo buddy near [[Fort Worth]]. His friend had a brother (Matthew \"Papa\" Smith) who cut hair during the day and played drums as a hobby. After an introduction and impromptu gig at an empty bar in Fort Worth, he and Papa would go on to be the founding members of Ryan Bingham and the Dead Horses.<ref name=3DotMag>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PLUyADYR_w|title=Ryan Bingham Interviewed by 3DotMag|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> [[Marc Ford]] of the [[Black Crowes]] was one of the few people in the bar that night.
