After several years of performing throughout Texas, the quartet released an independent album in 1994; this album was later picked up by [[Curb Records]], who re-packaged and re-released it a year later. By 1995, its second single (entitled \"[[You Have the Right to Remain Silent (song)|You Have the Right to Remain Silent]]\") had become a Top 5 hit on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now [[Hot Country Songs]]) charts.\n\nAlthough Perfect Stranger never entered Top 40 on the country charts again, the band continued to perform and record throughout the 1990s, charting several more singles before eventually exiting Curb in the late 1990s. In addition, Andy Ginn was replaced by Marty Arbter on drums. Perfect Stranger returned to Curb to release its second album, ''The Hits'', in 2001, and was dropped again afterward. As of 2009, the band is composed of co-lead singers/guitarists Marcus Eldridge and Clint Williams, bassist Shayne Morrison, lead guitarist Chad Ware, and drummer Doug Martin. A third album, ''Shake the World'', was released in 2009. Morrison briefly re-established the band in 2010 with Murray, Raines, and new drummer Scott Zucknick.\n\n==Biography==\nPerfect Stranger was founded in 1986 in [[Carthage, Texas]], by Steve Murray (lead vocals), Shayne Morrison (bass guitar), Richard Raines (lead guitar), and Andy Ginn (drums).<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p146793/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Perfect Stranger biography |accessdate=2008-01-07 |last=Loftus |first=Johnny |work=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> They originally performed as Midnight Express before assuming the name Perfect Stranger.<ref name=\"oldies\">{{cite web |url=http://www.oldies.com/artist-biography/Perfect-Stranger.html |title=Perfect Stranger biography |accessdate=2008-01-07 |work=Oldies.com}}</ref> The four artists played together throughout the state of Texas, mostly in clubs and at rodeos. In December 1994, they released an independent album on the Pacific label, entitled ''It's Up to You''. Featured on it was the single \"Ridin' the Rodeo\". Written by [[Vince Gill]] and [[Kostas Lazarides|Kostas]],<ref name=\"talent\"/> the song was considered the biggest independent country music hit in the United States at the time, although it never reached the ''Billboard'' charts.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/>\n\nA second single, entitled \"[[You Have the Right to Remain Silent (song)|You Have the Right to Remain Silent]]\", followed soon afterward. By the time of its release, Perfect Stranger's success as an independent act had been noticed by [[Curb Records]], who acquired the band's debut album and its single. Curb continued promoting \"You Have the Right to Remain Silent\".<ref name=\"talent\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gatalent.com/Acts/Perfect_Stranger/perfect_stranger.html |title=Perfect Stranger |accessdate=2008-01-07 |work=GA Talent}}</ref> ''It's Up to You'' was then re-packaged and re-released in 1995 as ''You Have the Right to Remain Silent'', the band's major-label debut. By the middle of the year, its title track had reached No.&nbsp;4 on the country music charts, and No.&nbsp;61 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].\n\nThey were nominated in 1996 at the [[31st Academy of Country Music Awards]] for [[Academy of Country Music Award for New Vocal Duo or Group of the Year|Best New Vocal Duo or Group of the Year]], along with [[4 Runner]] and [[Lonestar]], losing to the latter group. \n\nThroughout the 1990s and into the 2000s, Perfect Stranger continued to chart singles on occasion, although none of their other singles entered Top 40 on the country music charts. By the end of the 1990s, Andy Ginn had departed,<ref name=\"oldies\"/> with Marty Arbter taking over on drums. They eventually left Curb in the late 1990s, but rejoined the label in the early 2000s.<ref name=\"dish\"/>\n\nThe band's second album, ''The Hits'', was issued in 2001, also on Curb.<ref name=\"oldies\"/> This album included a re-recording of \"You Have the Right to Remain Silent\",<ref name=\"dish\">{{cite web|url=http://www.musicdish.com/mag/index.php3?id=6439|title=Texas Country Act \"Perfect Stranger\" Gives Nashville Second Try|last=Freeman|first=Anne|date=2002-08-05|work=Music Dish|accessdate=2009-05-05}}</ref> as well as \"Fire When Ready\" and \"A Little Bit More of Your Love\", which had charted in 1997. The album also produced two more non-charting singles in its title track (co-written by former [[MCA Records]] artist [[Marty Brown (singer)|Marty Brown]]) and \"Miracle\". After these two, the band exited Curb again.\n\nAll of the original members except Morrison eventually left.
