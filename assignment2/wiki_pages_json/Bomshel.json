Signed to [[Curb Records]] in 2005, Bomshel's original lineup charted four [[single (music)|singles]] on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts, and recorded an unreleased album called ''Bomshel Stomp''. One of their songs, \"The Power of One\", was included in the soundtrack to the film ''[[Evan Almighty]]''. Lawson departed in December 2007, and Kelley Shepard was chosen as her replacement. The new lineup of Shepard and Osmunson released four more singles, including \"[[Fight Like a Girl (Bomshel song)|Fight Like a Girl]]\" and \"19 and Crazy,\" both of which reached the Country Top 40. In October 2009, Bomshel released its debut album, also titled ''[[Fight Like a Girl (Bomshel album)|Fight Like a Girl]]''. Bomshel released ''Hallleluy'all'' in 2012 before disbanding, and Osmunson founded a second duo called [[American Young]].\n\n==History==\nKristy Osmunson, a native of [[Sandpoint, Idaho]] moved to Nashville, Tennessee in early 2002.<ref name=\"gac\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gactv.com/gac/nw_cma_close_up/article/0,3034,GAC_26068_4828902_,00.html |title=NEW ARTIST SPOTLIGHT: Bomshel |accessdate=2007-07-13 |work=Great American Country |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20070801223434/http://www.gactv.com/gac/nw_cma_close_up/article/0,3034,GAC_26068_4828902_,00.html |archivedate=2007-08-01 }}</ref> Prior to meeting, the two worked as songwriters in Nashville, with Lawson's writing credits include tracks for [[Mila Mason]] and [[Linda Davis]].
