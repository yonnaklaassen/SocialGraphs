He debuted in 1990 with the single \"[[I'd Be Better Off (In a Pine Box)]]\", the first release from his 1990 [[Doug Stone (album)|self-titled]] debut album for [[Epic Records]]. Both this album and its successor, 1991's ''[[I Thought It Was You]]'', earned a platinum [[music recording sales certification|certification]] from the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]. Two more albums for Epic, 1992's ''[[From the Heart (Doug Stone album)|From the Heart]]'' and 1994's ''[[More Love (album)|More Love]]'', are each certified gold. Stone moved to [[Columbia Records]] to record ''[[Faith in Me, Faith in You]]'', which did not produce a Top Ten among its three singles. After suffering a heart attack and stroke in the late 1990s, he exited the label and did not release another album until ''[[Make Up in Love]]'' in 1999 on [[Atlantic Records]]. ''[[The Long Way]]'' was released in 2002 on the Audium label (now part of [[E1 Music]]), followed by two albums on the independent [[Lofton Creek Records]].\n\nStone has charted twenty-six singles on [[Hot Country Songs]], with his greatest chart success coming between 1990 and 1995. In this timespan, he had eight No.&nbsp;1 singles on the [[Hot Country Songs]] charts including \"[[In a Different Light (song)|In a Different Light]]\", \"[[A Jukebox with a Country Song]]\", \"[[Too Busy Being in Love]]\", and \"[[Why Didn't I Think of That]]\". He is known for his [[neotraditionalist country]] sound and frequent recording of [[ballads]].\n\n==Early life==\nStone was born as Douglas Jackson Brooks on June 19, 1956, in [[Marietta, Georgia]].<ref name=\"whitburn\">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2008|publisher=Record Research, Inc|year=2008|page=405|isbn=978-0-89820-177-2}}</ref> His mother, who was also a country music singer, taught him how to play guitar when he was 5.<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/doug-stone-mn0000198649/biography |title=Doug Stone biography |access-date=2007-08-05 |last=Huey |first=Steve |publisher=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> When he was 7, his mother placed him onstage to open for [[Loretta Lynn]].<ref name=\"oldies\">{{cite web |url=http://www.oldies.com/artist-biography/Doug-Stone.html |title=Doug Stone biography |access-date=2007-08-05 |work=Oldies.com}} Reprinted from Larkin, Colin, ''The Encyclopedia of Popular Music''.</ref><ref name=\"record\">{{cite news |last=Helper-Drahos |first=Marta |date=September 26, 2003 |title=Doug Stone makes comeback with show at Leelanau Sands |url=http://static.record-eagle.com/2003/sep/26stone.htm |work=[[Traverse City Record-Eagle]] |access-date=2007-08-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425042947/http://static.record-eagle.com/2003/sep/26stone.htm |archive-date=April 25, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> His mother and father later divorced, and he moved to live with his father.<ref name=\"oldies\"/> He found additional work singing as a teenager: first at local skating rinks, and then at local bars, and later as one member of a short-lived trio; in addition, he and his father worked as mechanics to make ends meet.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/><ref name=\"oldies\"/> He also built a recording studio in his house, while performing in local clubs.<ref name=\"people\"/>  By 1982, Stone was suffering from [[Depression (mood)|depression]] brought on by his musical career, when a friend introduced him to Carie Cohen, who would later become his second wife.<ref name=\"stambler\">{{cite book|last1=Stambler|first1=Irwin|last2=Laudon|first2=Grelun|title=Country Music: The Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d18K8QWcEo8C&pg=PA469|date=July 14, 2000|publisher=MacMillan|pages=468–470|isbn=9780312264871}}</ref> He played various local venues, and was discovered by a record label manager while singing at a [[Veterans of Foreign Wars]] hall.
