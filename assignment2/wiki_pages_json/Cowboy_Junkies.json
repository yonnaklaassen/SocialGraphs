John Timmins was a member of the band but left the group before the recording of their debut studio album.<ref name=\"86 Promo sheet\"/> The band line-up has never changed since, although they use several guest musicians on many of their studio albums, including multi-instrumentalist Jeff Bird who has performed on every album except the first.\n\nCowboy Junkies' 1986 debut studio album, produced by Canadian producer [[Peter J. Moore|Peter Moore]], was the [[blues]]-inspired ''[[Whites Off Earth Now!!]]'', recorded in the family garage using a single [[Ambisonics|ambisonic]] microphone.<ref name=EMC/>\n\nThe band gained wide recognition with their second studio album, ''[[The Trinity Session]]'' (1988), recorded in 1987 at Toronto's [[Church of the Holy Trinity (Toronto)|Church of the Holy Trinity]]. Their sound, again with [[Peter J. Moore|Peter Moore]] using the ambisonic microphone, and their mix of [[blues]], [[country music|country]], [[American folk music|folk]], [[rock music|rock]] and [[jazz]] earned them both critical attention and a strong fan base. The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' named the recording one of the 10 best albums of 1988.<ref name=EMC/> \n\nCowboy Junkies have gone on to record 16 studio albums and five live albums, with tour dates booked into 2024.<ref>{{cite web |title=Tour |url=https://cowboyjunkies.com/tour/ |website=Cowboy Junkies |access-date=24 November 2023}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n=== Early history===\nAlan Anton and Michael Timmins, lifelong friends who met in kindergarten, formed their first band in high school. In 1979, influenced by [[post-punk]] bands such as [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]] and [[Joy Division]], they recruited drummer Geoff Railton and vocalist Liza Dawson-Whisker, and formed Hunger Project in Toronto.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/whitesoff/open.html |title=Whites Off Earth Now {{!}} Backstory |website=Latent Recordings |access-date=June 11, 2018 |author=Anton, Alan |archive-date=January 17, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190117122349/http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/whitesoff/open.html |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://littlevillagemag.com/prairie-pop-an-interview-with-michael-timmins-of-the-cowboy-junkies/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017152650/https://littlevillagemag.com/prairie-pop-an-interview-with-michael-timmins-of-the-cowboy-junkies/ |title=An interview with Michael Timmins of the Cowboy Junkies |work=Little Village |date=October 23, 2013 |archive-date=October 17, 2015 |access-date=June 11, 2018 |author=McLeod, Kembrew |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1989-01-01-ca-236-story.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151029134019/http://articles.latimes.com/1989-01-01/entertainment/ca-236_1_country-music |title=The Cowboy Junkies' Addicting Vision : At its best, the band plays country music with a Velvet Underground twang |work=Los Angeles Times |date=January 1, 1989 |archive-date=October 29, 2015 |access-date=June 11, 2018 |author=Hilburn, Robert |url-status=live }}</ref> They moved to [[Manhattan]]'s [[Lower East Side]] and performed at a variety of clubs. In early 1981, the Hunger Project embarked on a multi-city tour of the United States. After that, Hunger Project moved to the United Kingdom, where they toured for three months and released the single \"The Same Inside/Assembly\" on their independent label, [[Latent Recordings]].<ref name=\"86 Promo sheet\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mypage.bluewin.ch:80/palesun/articles/CBJ86promo.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060511211421/http://www.mypage.bluewin.ch/palesun/articles/CBJ86promo.html |title=1986 promo sheet |website=palesun's Cowboy Junkies fan pages |date=May 11, 2006 |archive-date=May 11, 2006 |access-date=April 26, 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nWhen Hunger Project disbanded, Alan Anton and Michael Timmins remained in London and started an improvisational band named Germinal. The members – Michael Timmins on guitar, Alan Anton on bass, a drummer, and saxophonist, played whatever they wished on their instruments at the same time. Germinal released two studio albums: ''Germinal 1'' (1983) and ''Din'' (1984). The music newspaper [[New Musical Express]] said Germinal \"ranks among the most innovative and aggressive sounds to emerge from the independent scene this year.\" Alan Anton and Michael Timmins had a somewhat different take, saying, \"It was the ultimate release for us. But for the audience, it was quite a chore.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/literature-and-arts/music-popular-and-jazz-biographies/cowboy-junkies |title=Cowboy Junkies |website=Encyclopedia.com |access-date=June 11, 2018}}</ref> In London, they developed journeyman skills as musicians, and expanded their knowledge of music history — Michael Timmins worked in a record store for a year to make ends meet while with Germinal. Among those who were to influence Michael Timmins and Alan Anton were jazz musicians [[Cecil Taylor]], [[Ornette Coleman]], [[John Coltrane]], along with the sound of early blues musicians [[Lightnin' Hopkins]], [[John Lee Hooker]], [[Bukka White]], and [[Robert Johnson]].<ref name=\"Cold Dawn\"/> Germinal broke up after three years in autumn of 1984. Alan Anton moved to Berlin and Michael Timmins returned to New York City.<ref name=\"86 Promo sheet\"/>\n\nUpon their return to Toronto in 1985, Alan Anton and Michael Timmins rented a house, insulated the tiny garage, and, with younger brother Pete Timmins sitting in on drums, began exploring a new musical direction. Margo was drafted to join and recalls, \"I was contemplating going on to graduate school, staying in school. That was safe. I never wanted to be a musician or be onstage.\"<ref name=\"Cold Dawn\"/> Nevertheless, Michael Timmins began to hear something in what they were doing with their initial jams, realizing that a female voice was what the band needed. Michael Timmins said, \"I thought if you had this female voice on top of it, you could do anything you wanted.\"<ref name=\"Cold Dawn\"/>\n\nHowever, the slow musical tempos and whispery, hushed tones that defined their early work was not just musical inspiration, but came about by necessity. Their recording studio was their repurposed garage, which was just behind the house and bordered closely with their neighbours. On their first jam session, the police showed up due to a noise complaint from the neighbour.<ref name=\"Cold Dawn\"/> According to Michael Timmins, \"We realized we had to tone down. One thing fed into the other: Margo began to realize that her singing voice was more effective quiet. We began to realize, if we can get down underneath Margo, the sound will be more effective. Pete picked up brushes – he was just learning to play drums at that point. Everything sort of came down. We learned to play with less volume.\"<ref name=\"Cold Dawn\"/>\n\nWhen the unnamed band was preparing for its first gig, the members considered various names before choosing Cowboy Junkies.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/worldfolkandjazz/8828140/Cowboy-Junkies-QandA-with-Margo-Timmins.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220112/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/worldfolkandjazz/8828140/Cowboy-Junkies-QandA-with-Margo-Timmins.html |archive-date=January 12, 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |title=Cowboy Junkies: Q&A with Margo Timmins |work=The Telegraph |date=October 17, 2011 |access-date=June 11, 2018 |author=Chilton, Martin}}{{cbignore}}</ref> During their early gigs the band would perform at [[The Rivoli]] which had a small space in the back. The group would perform a rhythmic groove while Margo sang improvised vocal melodies and portions of old blues songs. Many times the Junkies entire performance would be a single jam session.<ref name=\"Cold Dawn\"/>\n\n[[Peter J. Moore|Peter Moore]], a recording enthusiast who had ambitions of becoming a producer, was at their first show. According to Moore, \"I was mesmerized by Margo. The very first show, people weren't paying attention to them, because they were playing so softly and quietly.

They met Peter Moore at a dinner party, and when they began talking about recording equipment and techniques, they found that Moore's interest in single-microphone recording meshed with their desire to capture the intimate sound of their rehearsal garage.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.masslive.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2018/04/cowboy_junkies_reflect_on_30_y.html |title=Cowboy Junkies reflect on 30 years before Northampton show |work=Mass Live |date=April 4, 2018 |access-date=June 12, 2018 |author=Lenker, George}}</ref> Moore had just purchased a Calrec [[Ambisonics|Ambisonic]] microphone at the wholesale price of $9,000.<ref name=\"Cold Dawn\"/> The Cowboy Junkies and Moore came together at the rehearsal space on June 26, 1986, and turned the garage into a recording studio. Moore arranged the group around his Calrec, jury-rigged a control room in the kitchen, and started recording.<ref name=\"Sound on Sound\">{{cite web |url=https://www.soundonsound.com/people/cowboy-junkies-sweet-jane |title=Cowboy Junkies 'Sweet Jane' |work=Sound on Sound |access-date=April 27, 2018 |date=October 2015 |author=Doyle, Tom}}</ref>\n\nThe Cowboy Junkies shopped their material but were unable to find a label to distribute their work, so they revived the indie label [[Latent Recordings]] that Michael Timmins and Anton had used for their Hunger Project and Germinal works, and released ''[[Whites Off Earth Now!!]]'' in October 1986. They sold 3,000 copies.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Barclay, Michael |author2=Jack, Ian A.D. |author3=Schneider, Jason |year=2001 |title=Have Not Been The Same: The Canrock Renaissance, 1985-1995 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xLIiOE_jCpAC&q=cowboy+junkies+peter+moore+1985&pg=PT528 |location=Toronto, Ontario, Canada |publisher=ECW Press|isbn=9781554909681 }}</ref> The band then toured the US. Michael Timmins described the experience: \"While touring ''Whites'' we had spent a lot of time in the Southern states, especially Virginia, Georgia and the Carolinas. For some reason the club owners down there took a liking to what we were doing so we spent a lot of time crossing the kudzu choked highways that ran through the heart of the old Confederacy. Those were the days when having to spend a night in a hotel room would mean the difference between eating the next day or paying for the gas to get us to the next town, so we spent a lot of our time sleeping on the floors of friendly promoters, fans, waitresses and bartenders.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/blog/archives/4313 |title=A Look Back At….The Trinity Session (history – part 1 of 3) |website=Latent Recordings |date=November 6, 2014 |access-date=April 4, 2018 |author=Timmins, Michael |archive-date=April 27, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180427190815/http://latentrecordings.com/blog/archives/4313 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe band's next project, ''[[The Trinity Session]]'' (1988), became their breakthrough. Peter Moore again produced the album. They approached the project as a reaction against the [[MIDI]]–dominated musical styles of the '80s. Moore said, \"I was angry that music had gotten into drum machines and MIDI. No humanity, no nothing. I'm listening to these recordings from the '50s with two or three mics and I'm going, 'Man that's real music.'\" He chose the [[Church of the Holy Trinity (Toronto)|Church of the Holy Trinity]] in Toronto for its natural reverb. To better persuade the officials of the historic church, Moore claimed \"The Timmins Family Singers\" were recording a Christmas special.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/trinitysession/index8.html |title=Trinity Sessions {{!}} Page 8 |website=Latent Recordings |access-date=June 12, 2018 |author=Timmins, Michael }}{{Dead link|date=May 2024 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The session began early on November 27, 1987. Songs with the fewest instruments were recorded first, and then the songs with gradually more complex arrangements. In this way Moore was able to solve acoustic problems one by one. To better balance Margo's vocals against the electric guitars and drums, she was recorded through a PA system left behind by a previous group. By making subtle changes in volume and placement relative to the microphone over six hours, Moore and the band finally reached the distinctive sound of the album.<ref name=\"Sound on Sound\"/>\n\nMusic critic for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine, [[Anthony DeCurtis]], summed up the result of the group's efforts in a four-star review of the album: \"The Trinity Session is in the great tradition of albums that establish a mood and sustain it so consistently that the entire record seems like one continuously unfolding song. The mood in this instance is hypnotic and introspective – an intense, melancholic longing that blends the elemental emotions of country music and the blues with the poetic world-weariness of [[the Velvet Underground]]. [...] Having good songs, the skill to convey what they have to say and, most important, a vision, the Cowboy Junkies dispensed with high-tech trumpery and made their record simply and seriously. That attitude helped make the album as important as it is inspiring.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.junkiesfan.com/articles/rollingstone_tts.html |title=Rolling Stone Review of The Trinity Session |website=Junkies Fan |date=February 9, 1989 |access-date=June 12, 2018 |author=DeCurtis, Anthony |archive-date=June 12, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612172429/http://www.junkiesfan.com/articles/rollingstone_tts.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe album was included in the book ''[[1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die]]''.<ref>{{cite book |title=1001 albums you must hear before you die |date=2006 |publisher=Universe |editor=Dimery, Robert. |isbn=0789313715 |location=New York, NY |oclc=63515375}}</ref>\n\n=== 1990s ===\nThe band's third studio album was more challenging, requiring three attempts to get the sound the band desired. Yet despite the problems with the making of it, the band considers it a very exciting and turbulent time in their career and state that ''[[The Caution Horses]]'' (1990) remains one of their favourite albums.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/cautionhorses/index2.html |title=Cowboy Junkies {{!}} Caution Horses {{!}} Page 2 |website=Latent Recordings |access-date=April 27, 2018 |archive-date=April 28, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180428093807/http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/cautionhorses/index2.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> The band rented a small recording studio in the docklands of Toronto with the intention of using the room like the garage their debut studio album was recorded in, instead of a room with live acoustics like the church room they used for ''The Trinity Session'' (1988). The session went badly because the group had just come off the road after a gruelling tour and were tired, particularly Margo Timmins who had a terrible head cold. After a few hours they realized the session wasn't working out, and they left.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/cautionhorses/index3.html |title=Cowboy Junkies {{!}} Caution Horses {{!}} Page 3 |website=Latent Recordings |access-date=April 27, 2018 }}{{Dead link|date=May 2024 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThe second attempt was made on April 21 of 1987 when [[Peter J. Moore|Peter Moore]] rented the [[Sharon Temple]], an historic landmark located in the village of Sharon, Ontario. Michael Timmins recalls, \"The arrangements that we had developed for this new set of songs were at times so full and lush, unlike the spareness of most of Trinity's songs, that we were immediately confronted with the problem of how to control this swirl of sound so that it didn't just turn to mush on tape. Another problem was that the Temple was a lot more acoustically lively than any of us had imagined. As a result when the music swelled it would often spill over into Margo's vocal mic and feedback.\" At the end of three days during which the temperature would drop below freezing,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/cautionhorses/index4.html |title=Cowboy Junkies {{!}} Caution Horses {{!}} Page 4 |website=Latent Recordings |access-date=April 27, 2018 |archive-date=March 4, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304105425/http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/cautionhorses/index4.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> Michael Timmins states, \"When we packed up and left Sharon that day I don't think that any of us felt that we had captured anything special. It had been a difficult three days and I think that we were all just happy that on that third day we had at least made some decent recordings of the songs if not necessarily memorable ones.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/cautionhorses/index5.html|title=Cowboy Junkies {{!}} Caution Horses {{!}} Page 5|website=Latent Recordings|access-date=April 27, 2018|archive-date=April 25, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170425023811/http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/cautionhorses/index5.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> Over the next several months the band were touring and playing songs on the Sharon tape. As the band listened, new ideas for them evolved. They also wrote additional songs. Although the band truly loved the recordings, the songs continued to develop on stage, and they believed the session no longer accurately represented where they were as a band. In 2022, however, they released the Sharon session as a special edition vinyl album as well as in streaming formats.<ref>{{cite web |title=New..Lost…Album, Sharon, Available on Vinyl |url=https://cowboyjunkies.com/tag/sharon/ |website=Cowboy Junkies official website |access-date=11 November 2022}}</ref>\n\nAt the end of the tour, they decided to go into Eastern Studios in downtown Toronto and reinvent how they recorded themselves.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/cautionhorses/index6.html |title=Cowboy Junkies {{!}} Caution Horses {{!}} Page 6 |website=Latent Recordings |access-date=April 27, 2018 |archive-date=April 24, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170424085600/http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/cautionhorses/index6.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> ''[[The Caution Horses]]'' sessions went quickly and smoothly, and were recorded over several days in December 1989. Michael Timmins believes: \"The beauty of the recording and one of the reasons it remains one of our favourites is that it captures the essence of the band which magically fell together during the recording of The Trinity Session and which forged its own voice, under the glare of a very intense spotlight, in the clubs and concert halls of the world.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/cautionhorses/index7.html |title=Cowboy Junkies {{!}} Caution Horses {{!}} Page 7 |website=Latent Recordings |access-date=April 27, 2018 |archive-date=April 24, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170424085504/http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/cautionhorses/index7.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nWith their next studio album, ''[[Black Eyed Man]]'' (1992), Michael Timmins wanted to explore music structure, specifically time shifts and tempo shifts; while Margo Timmins wanted to expand her singing style and her range.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.junkiesfan.com/articles/musicexpress.html |title=The Cowboy Junkies: The Way They Groove Together {{!}} Music Express {{!}} March 1992 |website=JunkiesFan.com |access-date=June 13, 2018 |author=Finlay, Liza |archive-date=July 5, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705100955/http://www.junkiesfan.com/articles/musicexpress.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> Several musicians from previous albums showed up during the rehearsal sessions, along with about twenty five other Toronto players that were known to the band, or recruited because of their skills with instruments the band wanted to include in the album.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/blackeyedman/index4.html |title=Cowboy Junkies {{!}} Black Eyed Man {{!}} Page 4 |website=Latent Recordings |access-date=April 27, 2018 |archive-date=November 28, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091128091722/http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/blackeyedman/index4.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> Realizing he needed a theme to hold the album together what Michael Timmins decided upon was \"love found, love lost and love betrayed - it was to be the journey of the faceless, nameless and haunted Black Eyed Man.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/blackeyedman/index3.html |title=Cowboy Junkies {{!}} Black Eyed Man {{!}} Page 3 |website=Latent Recordings |access-date=April 27, 2018 |archive-date=November 28, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091128072526/http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/blackeyedman/index3.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe band's fifth studio album, ''[[Pale Sun, Crescent Moon]]'' (1993) is a song cycle about male-female relationships.

While it hasn't exactly turned into a [[hard-rock]] band (the closely drawn, highly literate, mood-conscious internal monologue remains the signature of the band's style), those aggressive opening and closing moments do signal a desire to avoid being typecast as that whispering band that found success by recording in an echoing church.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1994-04-07-ca-43281-story.html |title=A New Song and Dance for the Cowboy Junkies : Music: The group's 'Pale Sun, Crescent Moon' takes a more aggressive approach than the albums that gave the band its signature hushed sound. |work=Los Angeles Times |date=April 7, 1994 |access-date=April 27, 2018 |author=Boehm, Mike}}</ref>\n\nThe Cowboy Junkies' sixth studio album, ''[[Lay It Down (Cowboy Junkies album)|Lay It Down]]'' (1996), was one in which the group wanted to make the music outside of Toronto and away from usual routines, so they searched for a place that was a comfortable drive away from Toronto, but would feel remote. Alan Anton recalls, \"We found Rock Island, named not for music but for geology. It is actually one big rock with stuff growing on it and has one small house with a great stone fireplace. We went there for a week at a time and between chopping wood, cooking, boating, whittling, hiking and staring into the fire, worked up some songs that were as laid back and sparse as the setting.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/layitdown/index.html |title=Cowboy Junkies {{!}} Lay It Down {{!}} Page 1 |website=Latent Recordings |access-date=April 28, 2018 |archive-date=March 27, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190327204456/http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/layitdown/index.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> When the Junkies went to record the songs, they felt that their chosen songs would come together if they could \"find a studio which would approximate the vibe of Rock Island in the sense of a relaxed but focused mood and its remoteness from the music industry mainland.\" They found a big-porched southern house in [[Athens, Georgia]] that fit their needs. The Junkies moved into the rented home in the suburbs of Athens in June 1995. The producer and engineer John Keane had built a homey but state-of-the-art studio, and the band settled in quickly.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/layitdown/index3.html|title=Cowboy Junkies {{!}} Lay It Down {{!}} Page 3|website=Latent Recordings|access-date=April 28, 2018|archive-date=February 3, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100203191541/http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/layitdown/index3.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe Cowboy Junkies' last studio album of the decade is an [[alternative country]] album, ''[[Miles from Our Home]]'' (1998). Wanting to repeat the process of writing and creating used for ''[[Lay It Down (Cowboy Junkies album)|Lay It Down]]'', Michael Timmins found a house near a [[gristmill]] on a pond, a couple hours drive from Toronto, where he spent six months writing songs. During that time, Margo and Peter Timmins and Alan Anton would come down to work on songs. Then Michael wrote more, until the songs were worked out and ready to record.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/miles/index2.html |title=Miles From Our Home {{!}} Page 2 |website=Latent Recordings |access-date=June 13, 2018 |author=Anton, Alan |archive-date=February 27, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100227103329/http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/miles/index2.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> On New Year's Day in 1997, just as Timmins was planning the album, the band heard that [[Townes Van Zandt]] had died. Van Zandt was a friend of the band, had toured with them in their bus in 1990, and was perhaps the biggest influence as a songwriter on Michael. On the day that Michael Timmins had heard that Van Zandt had died he wrote the first draft of \"Blue Guitar\", \"as a tribute to the man who had the bluest guitar that I had ever heard.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/miles/ |title=Cowboy Junkies {{!}} Miles From Our Home |website=Latent Recordings |access-date=April 28, 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== 2000s ===\nThroughout their career, Cowboy Junkies have approached each studio album to see where they can change or improve.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.junkiesfan.com/articles/musicexpress.html |title=The Cowboy Junkies: The Way They Groove Together {{!}} Music Express |website=Junkies Fan |date=March 1992 |access-date=April 28, 2018 |author=Finlay, Liza |archive-date=July 5, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705100955/http://www.junkiesfan.com/articles/musicexpress.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> ''[[Open (Cowboy Junkies album)|Open]]'', which was released on May 15, 2001,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/r530810/review |title=Open - Cowboy Junkies |website=AllMusic |access-date=April 28, 2018}}</ref> follows in that tradition. While they were on a tour to support their live album ''[[Waltz Across America]]'', which lasted nine months and had many breaks in the schedule, they began working on new material. They added two to three new songs a month into their performances, allowing the songs to evolve on stage. During breaks, they would go to sound engineer Daryl Smith's studio, Chemical Sound, to live record material they had created.  Being able to set up in a couple hours, record some tracks, and be done by the end of the day was a departure from their habit of trying to complete an album's worth of songs in a set recording period. On each visit, they would record two or three songs. They also took the opportunity to re-record songs. After the band had recorded fifteen tracks, they listened and decided they had the songs they needed, with two additional songs recorded at [[Peter J. Moore|Peter Moore]]'s home studio.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/open/open_index.htm |title=Cowboy Junkies :: Open |website=Latent Recordings |access-date=April 28, 2018 |author=Anton, Alan |archive-date=March 27, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190327204516/http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/open/open_index.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n''[[One Soul Now]]'' (2004) was recorded over the course of a year, from October 2002 to October 2003. Its central idea is that everyone is interconnected. When the band returned home after their Open Tour, they decided to turn their rehearsal area into a recording studio which they dubbed The Clubhouse. This new arrangement changed the process of how they created their tracks. Previously, they would start in the rehearsal space, determine how the songs would work, then go to a studio. Now, the band recorded everything as they worked through the rehearsal process.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/onesoulnow/osn_album.swf |title=Cowboy Junkies One Soul Now |website=Latent Recordings |access-date=June 19, 2018 |archive-date=July 9, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130709235334/http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/onesoulnow/osn_album.swf |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe Cowboy Junkies next project was ''[[Early 21st Century Blues]]'', which was recorded February through March 2005, and released in August of that year.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/r787136 |title=Early 21st Century Blues - Cowboy Junkies |website=AllMusic |access-date=April 28, 2018}}</ref> It was begun a few months after their previous tour.

Michael Timmins wrote songs that \"reflect the complex, frustrating, edifying, and conflict-ridden web of relationships that constitute the family, from nuclear to extended to global.

In order to expand upon the goal of reinterpreting, the Cowboy Junkies invited three guest musicians whose work has affected the Cowboy Junkies, and whose work and lives were affected by the album. Guest musicians on the 2007 album include [[Natalie Merchant]], [[Vic Chesnutt]], and [[Ryan Adams]]. Each does lead vocal on one of the album's songs (Merchant on \"To Love Is to Bury\", Chesnutt on \"Postcard Blues\", and Adams on \"200 More Miles\"). They also perform on other tracks. Jeff Bird, a [[session musician]] who has appeared on virtually every Cowboy Junkies album, is also included in the project.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/trinity/main_content.html |title=Cowboy Junkies :: Trinity Revisited |website=Latent Recordings |access-date=April 28, 2018 |archive-date=July 9, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130709214735/http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/trinity/main_content.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> In order to create the same atmosphere, they kept rehearsal to a minimum, getting together for a few hours a day before the recording. The guest musicians worked with the band to re-imagine the songs, making suggestions, trying out fresh nuances. The album contains a performance film, ''[[Trinity Revisited]]'', and a documentary film, ''Trinity Session Revisited''. Directors Pierre and François Lamoureux, produced and recorded the album and the films. Although the album was not recorded with a single microphone like the original album, the directors placed the musicians in a circle and used a surround microphone, augmented the recording with ten close-mics to record them.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mixonline.com/recording/cowboy-junkies-go-back-church-365949 |title=Cowboy Junkies Go Back to Church |work=Mix |date=February 1, 2008 |access-date=April 28, 2018 |author=Jackson, Blair}}</ref>\n\n=== 2010s ===\n''[[The Nomad Series]]'' (2017) is a set of four studio albums that was released over three years from 2010 to 2012.

Two of his children were adopted from China, and during their stay they visited the birth village of his adopted daughters. Most of their time was spent in [[Jingjiang]], situated on the [[Yangtze]] River about two hours' drive from [[Shanghai]].<ref name=\"Renmin Park\">{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/renmin/renmin_park.html |title=Renmin Park |website=Latent Recordings |date=March 2010 |access-date=April 28, 2018 |author=Timmins, Michael |archive-date=April 29, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180429155137/http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/renmin/renmin_park.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> The music that inspired Timmins most during the visit was found at Renmin Park, where a variety of musicians would gather throughout the day, bringing their erhus, pipas, shangxians, various percussion instruments; and a mix of singers performed. Timmins found most of the musicians outstanding, he thought the singers were good because they all performed with passion. About halfway through the visit, Timmins was introduced to Eric Chen, who was passionate about music, and became Timmins' friend. Chen brought Timmins a variety of CDs and videos that showcased the Chinese rock scene.<ref name=\"Renmin Park\"/>\n\nMichael asked his brother, Peter Timmins, to send him a high-end portable recorder, which he carried everywhere he went, and recorded music, conversations, exercise classes, badminton games, traffic, students chatter in classrooms, street hawkers, and more. He sent the recordings to Joby Baker in British Columbia with instructions to create loops of the sounds, and to use his imagination. The core of the album is built around a fictional love story between two people who live in different worlds that always keep them apart. ''Renmin Park'' is also a thank-you letter to the people of the city that so kindly welcomed him and his family.<ref name=\"Renmin Park\"/>\n\nOn December 25, 2009, at the age of 45, Cowboy Junkies friend, [[Vic Chesnutt]], died from an overdose of [[muscle relaxant]]s.

As Cowboy Junkies pass the quarter century mark, the Toronto band must rest well at night. The band's consistent work flies under the radar more times than not and the band sounds content with keeping it that way.\" He continues, \"One of the band's live staples in recent years is \"Hunted\" from 1994's ''Pale Sun Crescent Moon''. Revisiting the song here, the original sounds frail and timid in comparison. Margo belts out the lyrics with the dry bitterness of someone who has witnessed first-hand the arrows that fly between men and women.
