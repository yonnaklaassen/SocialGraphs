They were first active in the 1970s and reformed in 2007, and are best known for being the band which launched [[Tom Petty]] to fame.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/mudcrutch-mw0000783357 | title=Mudcrutch - Mudcrutch &#124; Album &#124; AllMusic | website=[[AllMusic]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/2-mw0002938002 | title=2 - Mudcrutch &#124; Album &#124; AllMusic | website=[[AllMusic]] }}</ref>\n\nMudcrutch formed in Gainesville in 1970 and soon became a popular act across Florida. The band moved to Los Angeles in 1974 to attract the attention of a record company. Though they signed a contract with [[Shelter Records]], they released only one poor-selling single before breaking up in 1975. The following year, former Mudcrutch members Petty, [[Mike Campbell (musician)|Mike Campbell]], and [[Benmont Tench]] formed the core of a new band, the Heartbreakers.\n\nMost of the original Mudcrutch lineup reformed in 2007 to record their first album as a group, which was followed by a tour. A second album followed in 2016. Petty's death in 2017 effectively dissolved the group; Leadon died in 2023.\n\n== History ==\n=== 1970–1975 ===\nMudcrutch was formed in 1970 by [[Gainesville, Florida]], residents [[Tom Petty]] and [[Tom Leadon]] (brother of [[Bernie Leadon]] from [[The Eagles (band)|the Eagles]]), then teenagers, who had been playing together in a group called the Epics. Mudcrutch's lineup consisted of Petty (bass and vocals), Leadon (guitar and vocals), Jim Lenahan (vocals), Randall Marsh (drums) and [[Mike Campbell (musician)|Mike Campbell]] (guitar). Lenahan was initially the band's lead vocalist, but Petty very quickly also started singing lead on some songs.  \n\nThis incarnation of Mudcrutch issued a locally distributed single (\"Up In Mississippi\"/\"Cause Is Understood\") in 1971, with Petty writing and singing both songs. Leadon and Lenehan left the band in 1972 and were replaced by bassist/guitarist/vocalist Danny Roberts and keyboardist [[Benmont Tench]]. Ricky Rucker was a part of the band for a short time. Mudcrutch became locally popular and regularly played gigs from central Florida to southern Georgia. In Gainesville, they had a long stint as the house band at Dub's Lounge and organized several well-attended music festivals at \"Mudcrutch Farm\", a run-down house on a large lot where several band members lived.<ref>{{cite web|first=Amy|last=Reinink|url=http://www.gainesville.com/news/20080608/whats-left-of-the-mudcrutch-farm |title=What's left of the Mudcrutch Farm?  |website=Gainesville.com |access-date=September 28, 2018}}</ref>\n[[File:Campbell autograph.jpg|left|thumb|\"Depot Street\" [[gramophone record|vinyl]], signed by [[Mike Campbell (musician)|Mike Campbell]]]]\nIn 1974, the members of Mudcrutch decided to relocate to [[Los Angeles]] to try to sign with a major record label. After several rejections, they signed with [[Leon Russell]]'s independent [[Shelter Records]]. The band released one single, \"Depot Street\" in 1975, which failed to chart. After Danny Roberts left the group, Petty invited [[Charlie Souza]] to take over on bass guitar and the band continued recording in Leon Russell's [[The Church Studio|Tulsa studio]], and later at his [[Encino, California]], home. Discouraged by the group's lack of success, the record company broke up Mudcrutch in late 1975, keeping only Petty under contract. Several months later, Petty regrouped with former Mudcrutch members Mike Campbell and Benmont Tench to form [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers|the Heartbreakers]] along with fellow Gainesville natives [[Stan Lynch]] (drums) and [[Ron Blair]] (bass).<ref>DeYoung, Bill. \"Tom Petty: Full Steam Ahead\" ''Goldmine'' July 13, 1990: 18–30</ref>\n\n=== Reformation: 2007–2017 ===\nIn August 2007, Tom Petty invited Randall Marsh and Tom Leadon, original members of Mudcrutch, to reunite with Heartbreakers Benmont Tench and Mike Campbell to reform Mudcrutch. They recorded an album, ''[[Mudcrutch (album)|Mudcrutch]]'', which was released on April 29, 2008, by [[Reprise Records]], and contains 14 old and new tracks. \"We would play and then we would just talk about the old days,\" said Leadon. The band toured briefly in California to promote the album throughout April and the beginning of May 2008. The album hit number 8 on the [[Billboard 200]] albums chart.<ref name=\"billboard1\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/311924/mudcrutch/chart |title=Mudcrutch – Chart history |magazine=Billboard |access-date=March 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\nFans who bought tickets to the tour through [[Ticketmaster]] were given six free downloads from the album.\n\nOn November 11, 2008, a live EP titled ''[[Extended Play Live]]'' was released. All tracks were recorded live in April 2008. On the same day American music channel [[VH1 Classic]] broadcast a documentary about the band.\n\n[[File:Mudcrutch, June 2016.jpg|thumb|250px|Mudcrutch, performing in June 2016]]\nAccording to ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Mudcrutch intended to reconvene August 2015 to begin work on a new album. The group was originally going to begin work on the album in January of that year, but things were pushed back eight months due to medical issues that rhythm guitarist Tom Leadon was experiencing.<ref>{{cite magazine|title = Tom Petty's Pre-Fame Band Mudcrutch to Record New Album|url = https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/tom-pettys-pre-fame-band-mudcrutch-to-record-new-lp-20150602|magazine = Rolling Stone|access-date = October 9, 2015}}</ref> In February 2016, prior to the announcement that they were releasing a second album, Mudcrutch was announced as a headliner for both the 2016 Bunbury Music Festival in Cincinnati, Ohio, and the 2016 Summer Camp Music Festival in Chillicothe, Illinois.\n\nThe band's second full-length album, ''2'', was released May 20, 2016, on Reprise Records. Preceding the album's release was a single, \"Trailer\", as well as \"Beautiful World\" and \"Hungry No More\". The album hit number 10 on the [[Billboard 200]] albums chart.<ref name=\"billboard1\" /> Less than three days after the album was released, the band embarked on their first national tour in support of the album. The tour began the same way their 2008 tour did: with two benefit shows for the Midnight Mission (on May 23 and 24, 2016, in Los Angeles). [[Herb Pedersen]], who is also credited on ''2'', joined Mudcrutch on the tour.\n\nPetty died on October 2, 2017, of [[cardiac arrest]], while Leadon died on March 22, 2023, of natural causes.<ref>[https://wbsm.com/ixp/295/p/tom-leadon-dead/ Tom Leadon, Mudcrutch Co-Founder, Dead at 70]</ref> Both deaths effectively ended the possibility of any further Mudcrutch activity.\n\n== Personnel ==\n=== Band members ===\n* [[Tom Petty]] – bass (1971–1974, 2007–2017; his death), backing vocals (1971–1973, 2007–2017), lead vocals, harmonica (1971–1975, 2007–2017), rhythm guitar (1973–1975), keyboards (1971–1973)\n* [[Mike Campbell (musician)|Mike Campbell]] – lead guitar (1971–1975, 2007–2017), occasional lead vocals (2015–2017)\n* [[Tom Leadon]] – rhythm guitar, backing vocals (1971–1972, 2007–2017; died 2023), occasional lead vocals (2007–2017)\n* Jim Lenahan – lead vocals (1971–1972)\n* [[Benmont Tench]] – keyboards, backing vocals (1973–1975, 2007–2017), occasional lead vocals (2007–2017)\n* Randall Marsh – drums (1971–1975, 2007–2017), occasional lead vocals (2015–2017)\n* Danny Roberts – rhythm guitar, bass, backing vocals (1973–1974)\n* [[Charlie Souza]] – bass (1974–1975)\n\n==== Timeline ====\n{{#tag:timeline|\nImageSize  = width:800 height:auto barincrement:22\nPlotArea   = left:100 bottom:130 top:15 right:15\nAlignbars  = justify\nDateFormat = mm/dd/yyyy\nPeriod     = from:01/01/1970 till:10/02/2017\nTimeAxis   = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy\nLegend     = orientation:vertical position:bottom columns:3\nScaleMajor = increment:5 start:1970\nScaleMinor = increment:1 start:1970\n\nColors = \n id:vocals value:red         legend:Lead_vocals\n id:lgtr   value:teal        legend:Lead_guitar\n id:rgtr   value:brightgreen legend:Rhythm_guitar,_backing_vocals\n id:keys   value:purple      legend:Keyboards,_backing_vocals\n id:bass   value:blue        legend:Bass\n id:drums  value:orange      legend:Drums\n id:harm   value:tan2        legend:Harmonica\n id:album  value:black       legend:Studio_albums\n\nBarData =\n bar:Jim     text:\"Jim Lenahan\"\n bar:Petty   text:\"Tom Petty\"\n bar:Mike    text:\"Mike Campbell\"\n bar:Leadon  text:\"Tom Leadon\"\n bar:Danny   text:\"Danny Roberts\"\n bar:Ben     text:\"Benmont Tench\"\n bar:Charlie text:\"Charlie Souza\"\n bar:Randall text:\"Randall Marsh\"\n\nLineData = \n color:album layer:back\n at:04/29/2008\n at:05/20/2016\n\nPlotData = \n bar:Jim     from:start      till:01/01/1973 color:vocals width:11\n bar:Petty   from:start      till:01/01/1973 color:bass   width:11\n bar:Petty   from:start      till:01/01/1973 color:keys   width:3\n bar:Petty   from:01/01/1973 till:12/31/1975 color:vocals width:11\n bar:Petty   from:01/01/1973 till:12/31/1975 color:harm   width:7\n bar:Petty   from:01/01/1973 till:12/31/1975 color:rgtr   width:3\n bar:Petty   from:01/01/1973 till:09/01/1974 color:bass   width:5\n bar:Petty   from:08/01/2007 till:end        color:bass   width:3\n bar:Petty   from:08/01/2007 till:end        color:vocals width:11\n bar:Petty   from:08/01/2007 till:end        color:harm   width:7\n bar:Mike    from:start      till:12/31/1975 color:lgtr   width:11\n bar:Mike    from:08/01/2007 till:end        color:lgtr   width:11\n bar:Mike    from:01/01/2015 till:end        color:vocals width:3\n bar:Leadon  from:start      till:01/01/1973 color:rgtr   width:11\n bar:Leadon  from:08/01/2007 till:end        color:rgtr   width:11\n bar:Leadon  from:08/01/2007 till:end        color:vocals width:3\n bar:Danny   from:01/01/1973 till:09/01/1974 color:rgtr   width:11\n bar:Danny   from:01/01/1973 till:09/01/1974 color:bass   width:3\n bar:Charlie from:09/01/1974 till:12/31/1975 color:bass   width:11\n bar:Ben     from:01/01/1973 till:12/31/1975 color:keys   width:11\n bar:Ben     from:08/01/2007 till:end        color:keys   width:11\n bar:Ben     from:08/01/2007 till:end        color:vocals width:3\n bar:Randall from:start      till:12/31/1975 color:drums  width:11\n bar:Randall from:08/01/2007 till:end        color:drums  width:11\n bar:Randall from:01/01/2015 till:end        color:vocals width:3\n}}\n\n== Discography ==\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+\n!
