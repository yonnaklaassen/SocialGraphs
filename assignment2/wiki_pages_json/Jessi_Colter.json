Five years later, Colter signed with [[Capitol Records]] and released \"I'm Not Lisa\", which topped the country charts and reached the top five on the pop charts. In 1976 she was featured on the collaboration LP ''Wanted: The Outlaws'', which became an [[RIAA]]-certified Platinum album.\n\n== Early life ==\nMirriam Johnson was born on May 25, 1943,<ref name=allmusic>Ankeny, Jason [{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p30265/biography|pure_url=yes}} Jessi Colter biography at Allmusic.com]</ref> in [[Phoenix, Arizona]],<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gZIjT8PgJMEC&q=Jessi+Colter+1943&pg=PA105|title=The International Who's Who in Popular Music 2002|via=google.ca|isbn=978-1-85743-161-2|last1=Gregory|first1=Andy|year=2002|publisher=Psychology Press }}</ref> and raised in a strict [[Pentecostal]] home.<ref name=\"allmusic\" /> Her mother was a Pentecostal preacher and her father was a racecar driver. At age 11, Colter became the pianist at her church.<ref name=oldies>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldies.com/artist-biography/Jessi-Colter.html|title=Jessi Colter Biography|work=OLDIES.com}}</ref>\nAfter graduating from [[Mesa High School (Mesa, Arizona)|Mesa High School]] in 1961, she began singing in local clubs in Phoenix.  After marrying guitarist [[Duane Eddy]] in 1961, and still using her real name of Mirriam Johnson, she released two singles that were issued on the Jamie label.  The first, \"Lonesome Road\", received scattered airplay in several US markets, though not enough to make any national charts.   After a second single failed to even get regional airplay, Johnson did not record again for nearly a decade.  She continued to tour with Eddy until divorcing in 1968. The following year, she met country artist [[Waylon Jennings]] who helped her secure a recording contract with [[RCA Victor]], and married him.\n\n== Career ==\n=== Early career: 1970–1974 ===\nJohnson, now billing herself as \"Jessi Colter\", resumed her recording career in 1970.  That year, Waylon Jennings and Colter sang duet on two top 40 country chart hits. On March 25, 1970, she played keyboard for her husband during his appearance on ''[[The Johnny Cash Show]]''. She released her debut album, ''A Country Star is Born'', on RCA, with Jennings and [[Chet Atkins]] co-producing<ref name=allmusic /> The album was not successful and did not make an impact on the country music market. It was Colter's only album for RCA, and she left the label soon after. However, her face appears on several Jennings record covers from this period.\n\n=== Breakthrough success: 1975–1979 ===\nIn 1975, Colter signed with [[Capitol Records]]. On the label, she released her debut single, \"[[I'm Not Lisa]]\".<ref name=cd>Zimmerman, Keith and Kent (2003), ''The Very Best of Jessi Colter'', retrieved August 8, 2008</ref> The song was Colter's breakthrough single; it reached No. 1 on the [[Hot Country Songs|Billboard Country Chart]] and peaked at No. 4 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|Billboard Pop Chart]], becoming a crossover hit in 1975. Her second album, titled ''[[I'm Jessi Colter]]'' was also released that year and reached No. 1 on the Cashbox [[Top Country Albums]] chart, No. 4 on the Billboard Country Albums Chart and No. 50 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] Top 100 Pop Albums chart.<ref name=allmusic /> The follow-up single from that same album  \"[[What's Happened to Blue Eyes]]\" was also very successful,<ref name=roughguide /> peaking at No.&nbsp;5 on the Billboard Country Chart and No. 57 on the Pop Chart. The single's B-side, \"You Ain't Never Been Loved (Like I'm Gonna Love You),\" charted among the Top Pop 100 also in 1975.\n\nA survey of industry sources reveals that Capitol was releasing both \"You Ain't Never Been Loved\" and \"What's Happened to Blue Eyes\" as simultaneous singles for the Pop and Country markets. The confusion in marketing was made evident when programmers were uncertain of which single to play. Both sides of the same record scored on the Pop Top 100, but \"What's Happened to Blue Eyes\" powered into the Country Top 5. Capitol clearly recognized that a miscalculation had occurred and subsequently purchased full-page industry ads saying, \"We've FLIPPED. What's Happened to Blue Eyes IS the single.\" It was too little, too late. With two competing singles marketed to radio, Capitol's risky move made certain that Colter would not naturally follow-up the success of 'I'm Not Lisa' in the Pop Top 40.\n\nThe second single was nevertheless a huge country/pop success and later that year, Colter launched a nationwide tour as part of Waylon Jennings' program at the [[Santa Monica Civic Auditorium]]. In 1976 Colter released her second and third Capitol studio albums, ''[[Jessi (album)|Jessi]]'' and ''[[Diamond in the Rough (album)|Diamond in the Rough]].'' Both albums were as successful as Colter's 1975 album,<ref name=allmusic /> both debuting at No.&nbsp;4 on the Top Country Albums chart. The lead single from her ''Jessi'' album, \"[[It's Morning (And I Still Love You)]]\" was a Top 15 country hit in 1976 on the country charts. Her second album that year, ''Diamond in the Rough'' produced only one charting single, \"I Thought I Heard You Calling My Name\".<ref name=allmusic /> At this point, Colter had established herself as a big-selling \"albums artist,\" rather than a casual honky-tonk hitmaker, given that her talents were far more inclined to soul-rock than to mundane country music. For the remainder of the decade, Colter toured with her husband, [[Waylon Jennings]], and released her studio album ''[[Mirriam]]'' in 1977. She then released her next album, ''[[That's the Way a Cowboy Rocks and Rolls]]'' the following year.<ref name=allmusic /> Her success began to decline through the remainder of the decade, with her final two albums of the decade not producing any Top 40 country hits.\n\n=== Later music career: 1980–2002 ===\nIn 1981, Colter and her husband returned to release a duet album entitled ''[[Leather and Lace]]''.<ref name=allmusic /> The album's first single, \"Storms Never Last,\" was written by Colter,<ref name=roughguide /> and the second single, \"[[The Wild Side of Life]]\"/\"[[It Wasn't God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels]],\" was also a major hit in 1981,<ref name=allmusic /> peaking at No. 10 on the Billboard Country Chart. The album was certified Gold in sales by the RIAA that year, Colter's second RIAA-certified album to date.<ref>Hank Williams Jr. made reference to the couple's more settled lifestyle that year in \"All My Rowdy Friends Have Settled Down,\" which was a No. 1 hit for him (\"And Waylon's staying home and loving Jessi more these days, And nobody wants to get drunk and get loud, And all my rowdy friends have settled down.\")</ref> [[Stevie Nicks]] wrote the title track of the album; however, after receiving word that Colter and Jennings might divorce, Nicks released her own version of the song as a duet with [[Don Henley]]. It peaked at No. 6 on Pop chart, also in 1981. Also in 1981 Colter released her final studio album on Capitol records, ''[[Ridin' Shotgun]]'', which also spawned Colter's last charting single on the country charts, \"Holdin' On\".\n\nAs the decade progressed, Colter's success began to decline. She released an album in 1984 on the Triad label titled ''[[Rock and Roll Lullaby (album)|Rock and Roll Lullaby]],'' produced by [[Chips Moman]].<ref name=allmusic /> However, in the later years of the decade, she decided to let her recording career decline to help take care of and nurse her husband through his [[drug abuse]] and various medical problems. She remained active during this time.<ref name=cmt>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/colter_jessi/bio.jhtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040222184311/http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/colter_jessi/bio.jhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 22, 2004|title=Jessi Colter Bio – Jessi Colter Career|work=CMT Artists}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 1990s, she focused her attention on performing and released an album of [[children's music]] titled ''[[Jessi Colter Sings Just for Kids: Songs from Around the World]]'' in early 1996. It featured a guest appearance by Jennings, who recited some of his poetry for the video.<ref name=allmusic /> In 2000, Colter performed on Jennings's live album ''Never Say Die'', released two years before his death in 2002, at age 64.<ref name=cmt />\n\n=== Return to music: 2006–present ===\nIn 2006, Colter returned to recording with a new studio album released on the [[Shout! Factory]] label, ''[[Out of the Ashes (Jessi Colter album)|Out of the Ashes]]''.<ref name=allmusic /> \"Out of the Ashes\" was Colter's first studio album in over 20 years. The album was produced by [[Don Was]] and reflected on Jennings' death. [[Waylon Jennings|Jennings]] had an unused vocal, \"Out of the Rain,\" which was featured on the track.\n\nThe album was given many positive reviews, including [[Allmusic]], which gave the album four out of five stars in 2006.<ref>[{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r819484|pure_url=yes}} ''Out of the Ashes'' album review], [[AllMusic]]</ref> ''Out of the Ashes'' was her first album since 1981 to chart on the Top Country Albums chart, peaking at No. 61.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/news-in-brief/1549819/grammy-hall-of-fame-honors-country-songs.jhtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116053759/http://www.cmt.com/news/news-in-brief/1549819/grammy-hall-of-fame-honors-country-songs.jhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 16, 2009|title=Grammy Hall of Fame Honors Country Songs|work=CMT News}}</ref> In 2007 Colter recorded a duet version of her 1975 hit \"I'm Not Lisa\" with [[Deana Carter]] on her 2007 album, ''[[The Chain (Deana Carter album)|The Chain]].''<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090116053801/http://www.cmt.com/news/news-in-brief/1567321/deana-carters-new-cd-due-oct-9.jhtml Deana Carter's New CD Due October 9] ''Country Music Television:'' Jessi Colter news & updates</ref> In 2017, Colter and [[Jan Howard]] provided guest vocals to a track appearing on [[Written in Song]], an album by [[Jeannie Seely]]. The song, called \"We're Still Hangin' In There Ain't We Jessi\", references how Seely and Colter are seemingly two of the only women in country music who managed to have a successful marriage.\n\nColter's first album in eleven years, ''The Psalms'' was released on March 24, 2017, via [[Legacy Recordings]]. The album consisted of Colter's favourite [[Book of Psalms]] passages put to music and was produced by [[Lenny Kaye]], who recalled an evening when he, Colter, Jennings and [[Patti Smith]] were having dinner together in 1995 when Colter began to sing passages of the Bible. Kaye stated that he was \"transfixed\" and kept the evening in his mind until he convinced Colter to record those renditions in 2007, with the album being recorded over the course of two sessions, along with a further two in 2008. Of the album, Kaye stated that \"we tried to choose songs that weren't about warring peoples but more about comfort and reconciliation\".<ref>{{cite web|author=David Browne |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/country/features/inside-jessi-colters-psychedelic-christian-album-w473382 |title=Inside Jessi Colter's 'Psychedelic Christian' Album |publisher=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=March 2, 2017|access-date=April 12, 2020}}</ref> On April 11, 2017, Colter released a [[tell-all]] memoir titled \"''An Outlaw and a Lady: A Memoir of Music, Life with Waylon, and the Faith That Brought Me Home''\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://countryrebel.com/blogs/videos/waylon-jennings-widow-jessi-colter-to-release-tell-all-book-about-their-marriage|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180203005847/https://countryrebel.com/blogs/videos/waylon-jennings-widow-jessi-colter-to-release-tell-all-book-about-their-marriage|archive-date = February 3, 2018|title = Waylon Jennings' Widow Jessi Colter to Release Tell-All Book About the &#124; Country Rebel| date=November 14, 2016 }}</ref>\n\nHer twelfth solo album ''Edge of Forever'' is set to be released on October 27, 2023.
