Her early years were spent in a studio apartment in [[New York City]], although the family moved to [[New Jersey]] when she was old enough to attend school. In 1987, her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer and died two years later (inspiring the song \"Best Friend\"), forcing her father to raise her himself as he traveled around the country for his music career. Falcon was ten years old when they moved to Nashville. Inspired by the loss of her mother and feeling out of place throughout her school years, she began writing poetry which eventually led to songwriting.\n\nFalcon signed to [[Columbia Records]] at the age of fourteen and released her debut album, ''Rose Falcon'', in 2003. In August 2011, she signed with [[Show Dog-Universal Music]] and began working on her first [[country pop]] album,<ref name=\"musicrow\">{{cite web|title=Signings: Bobby Terry, Rose Falcon|url=http://www.musicrow.com/2011/08/signings-bobby-terry-rose-falcon/|website=Musicrow.com|date=August 29, 2011 }}</ref> which was later released in the form of two EP's entitled, \"19th Avenue Volume 1\" and \"19th Avenue Volume 2 <ref name=\"all music\">{{cite web|title= 19th Avenue EP|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/19th-avenue-ep-mw0002363987/releases|website=[[AllMusic]]|date=January 29, 2013 }}</ref> and received an endorsement from [[Jon Bon Jovi]].<ref name=\"jbjquote\">{{cite web|title=Bon Jovi Backs Rose Falcon|url=http://www.keepinitcountryblog.com/2012/05/rose-falcon-bon-jovi/1|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140424202919/http://www.keepinitcountryblog.com/2012/05/rose-falcon-bon-jovi/1/|archivedate=April 24, 2014}}</ref>\n\n\"Give Into Me\", a song co-written by Falcon, [[Billy Falcon]], and Elisha Hoffman, was recorded by Country singer [[Faith Hill]] for the soundtrack of the motion picture ''[[Country Strong]]''.<ref name=\"boot\">{{cite web|url=http://www.theboot.com/2010/09/28/country-strong-soundtrack-track-listing/|title='Country Strong' Soundtrack Details Revealed|last=Conaway|first=Alanna|date=September 28, 2010|work=The Boot|publisher=AOL Music|accessdate=January 25, 2011}}</ref> \"[[Friday Night (Eric Paslay song)|Friday Night]]\", a song written by Falcon, [[Rob Crosby]], and [[Eric Paslay]], was recorded by [[Lady Antebellum]] for their 2011 album, ''[[Own the Night]]''.  \"[[Friday Night (Eric Paslay song)|Friday Night]]\", was later recorded by [[Eric Paslay]] and released as a single on April 22, 2013, and reached number one on the [[Mediabase]] country chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.countrymusicislove.com/country-music-news/eric-paslay-celebrates-1-single-friday-night/|title=Eric Paslay Celebrates number one single Friday Night - |publisher=Country Music Is Love  |date=February 4, 2014 |accessdate=February 4, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2013, Falcon became engaged to country artist [[Rodney Atkins]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tasteofcountry.com/rodney-atkins-rose-falcon-engaged/|title=Rodney Atkins Engaged to Rose Falcon|last=Dukes|first=Billy|date=June 6, 2013|work=[[Taste of Country]]|accessdate=June 11, 2013}}</ref> The couple married in November 2013 in a small ceremony on Captiva Island.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tasteofcountry.com/rodney-atkins-married-rose-falcon/|title=Rodney Atkins Marries Rose Falcon|last=Sciarretto|first=Amy|date=November 11, 2013|work=Taste of Country|accessdate=November 12, 2013}}</ref> Together, they have two sons, born in December 2017<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://people.com/babies/rodney-atkins-rose-falcon-atkins-welcome-son-ryder-falcon/|title=Introducing Ryder Falcon!
