She wore a [[David Meister]] dress.<ref name=reddress>{{cite web|url=http://www.shape.com/celebrities/celebrity-photos/stars-hit-runway-heart-health?page=17|title=Stars Hit the Runway for Heart Health|date=February 10, 2012|publisher=Shape.com|access-date=February 10, 2012|archive-date=February 14, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214185932/http://www.shape.com/celebrities/celebrity-photos/stars-hit-runway-heart-health?page=17|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn November 2019, Nettles attended the [[CMA Awards]] wearing a [[Christian Siriano]] design with a hot-pink train. The train had a hand-painted graffiti painting by Alice Mizrahi and a message stating \"play our [expletive] records; Please and Thank You\", and the backside said \"equal play\". Nettles' outfit was in protest of country music radio stations not giving equal play time to female artists.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.today.com/popculture/cma-awards-jennifer-nettles-wears-strongly-worded-message-t167165|title=Jennifer Nettles wears a strongly worded message to the CMA Awards|website=TODAY.com|date=November 14, 2019 |language=en|access-date=2019-11-14}}</ref>\n\nAt the 2020 [[CMT Music Awards]], she was recognized for her activism in the fight for equal play with the first CMT Equal Play award.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title=Jennifer Nettles Says 'We Have More to Do' as She Accepts First-Ever CMT Equal Play Award|url=https://people.com/country/cmt-awards-2020-jennifer-nettles-equal-play-award-speech/|access-date=2020-10-22|website=PEOPLE.com|language=EN}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n{{See also|Sugarland discography}}\n\n===Studio demos===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ As Jennifer Nettles\n|-\n!
