Howell was formerly a member of [[Southern Pacific (band)|Southern Pacific]], and LeMaire a former member of [[Exile (American band)|Exile]]. Burnin' Daylight recorded one album on [[Curb Records]] in 1996, in addition to charting three singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now [[Hot Country Songs]]) charts. The highest of these, \"Say Yes\", reached No.&nbsp;37.\n\n==History==\nBurnin' Daylight was formed in 1995 by [[Sonny LeMaire]], Kurt Howell, and Marc Beeson. LeMaire was formerly a member of [[Exile (American band)|Exile]],<ref>[http://www.exileband.com/members.htm Exile Members]</ref> and Howell, formerly of [[Southern Pacific (band)|Southern Pacific]] and later a solo artist for [[Reprise Records]].<ref name=\"Cst\">[http://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/cdreview.asp?xid=342 Burnin' Daylight - Burnin' Daylight]</ref> Marc Beeson was a Nashville songwriter who had previously charted a solo single on [[BNA Records]] in the early 1990s.<ref name=\"oldies\">[http://www.oldies.com/artist-biography/Burnin-Daylight.html Burnin' Daylight biography: Oldies.com]</ref> The group had originally assumed the name The Loose Cannons, but was forced to change its name to Burnin' Daylight because another band had the same name.<ref name=\"oldies\"/> Originally, songwriters [[Trey Bruce]] and [[Rob Crosby]] were slated to be members of Burnin' Daylight as well. However, they decided to focus on their respective solo careers instead.<ref name=\"oldies\"/>\n\nInitially, Burnin' Daylight was intended to be only a live band. They eventually sent a tape to [[Mike Curb]], head of the [[Curb Records]] label, who signed the group in 1997.<ref name=\"oldies\"/> In April of that year, Burnin' Daylight released its eponymous debut album. They charted three singles on the ''Billboard'' country music charts, including a Top 40 hit in \"Say Yes\". Robert Loy of ''[[Country Standard Time]]'' gave the album a negative review, criticizing it as formulaic in nature.<ref name=\"Cst\"/>\n\nIn 1997, the [[Academy of Country Music]] nominated Burnin' Daylight for the Top New Vocal Duo or Group award, but the band lost to [[Ricochet (band)|Ricochet]].\n\nSince disbanding in 1998, former bass guitarist [[Sonny LeMaire]] has written several singles for other artists, including the Number One hit \"[[Beautiful Mess (Diamond Rio song)|Beautiful Mess]]\" by [[Diamond Rio]], \"[[She Thinks She Needs Me]]\" by [[Andy Griggs]], and \"[[Fall (Clay Walker song)|Fall]]\" by [[Clay Walker]] (also recorded by [[Kimberley Locke]]). All of these were collaborations with [[Shane Minor]] and [[Clay Mills]]. LeMaire has also since reunited with Exile.\n\n==Discography==\n===Albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:14em;\"| Title\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:20em;\"| Album details\n! colspan=\"1\"| Peak positions\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n! width=\"60\"| [[Top Country Albums|US Country]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Burnin' Daylight''<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-All-Music/Billboard/90s/1997/Billboard-1997-06-21.pdf|title=Album Reviews|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=June 21, 1997}}</ref>\n| \n* Release date: April 15, 1997\n* Label: [[Curb Records]]\n| 74\n|}\n\n===Singles===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Year\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:14em;\"| Single\n! colspan=\"2\"| Peak chart<br />positions\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Album\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n! width=\"45\"| [[Hot Country Songs|US Country]]\n! width=\"45\"| [[RPM (magazine)|CAN Country]]\n|-\n| 1996\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Love Worth Fighting For\"\n| 49\n| —\n| align=\"left\" rowspan=\"4\"| ''Burnin' Daylight''\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\"| 1997\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Say Yes\"<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-All-Music/Billboard/90s/1997/Billboard-1997-02-22.pdf|title=Single Reviews|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|page=81|date=February 22, 1997}}</ref>\n| 37\n| 84\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Live to Love Again\"\n| 58\n| 96\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Nice Work (If You Can Get It)\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/release/13536753-Burnin-Daylight-Nice-Work-If-You-Can-Get-It|title=Nice Work (If You Can Get It) – Burnin' Daylight (1997, Single)|access-date=March 6, 2023|website=Discogs.com}}</ref>\n| —\n| —\n|-\n| 1998\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Wreckin' Ball\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/release/20503675-Burnin-Daylight-Wreckin-Ball|title=Wreckin' Ball – Burnin' Daylight (1998, Single)|access-date=March 6, 2023|website=Discogs.com}}</ref>\n| —\n| —\n| {{n/a}}\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" style=\"font-size:8pt\"| \"—\" denotes releases that did not chart\n|-\n|}\n\n===Music videos===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n!
