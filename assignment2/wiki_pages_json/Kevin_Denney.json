Signed to [[Lyric Street Records]] in 2001, he made his debut on the country music scene with the release of his self-titled album (2002's ''[[Kevin Denney (album)|Kevin Denney]]''), which produced three chart singles, including \"[[That's Just Jessie]]\", a Top 20 hit on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now [[Hot Country Songs]]) charts. He was dropped from Lyric Street's roster in 2003, although he co-wrote a track on [[Tracy Byrd]]'s 2006 ''[[Different Things]]'' album.\n\n==Biography==\nDenney's interest in music began at an early age. His mother and father, both of whom sang in a [[gospel music]] quartet, bought Denney his first guitar when he was three years old.<ref name=\"about\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.liveabout.com/country-4688258|title=Country|website=LiveAbout.com|accessdate=March 25, 2020}}</ref> He also became a frequent listener of the [[Grand Ole Opry]] radio shows, and played in his cousin's [[bluegrass music]] band.<ref name=\"about\"/>\n\nAt age 17, however, he briefly stopped focusing on his musical interests to re-assess his future. On his eighteenth birthday, his girlfriend took him to a [[George Strait]] concert. Seeing Strait in concert helped Denney discover that music was his passion, and he later joined a local band that was looking for a lead singer.<ref name=\"about\"/> Denney later went solo, and was signed to [[Lyric Street Records]] in 2001.<ref name=\"all\">{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/kevin-denney-mn0000767883 |title=Kevin Denny |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=January 6, 2022}}</ref> His eponymous debut album, released in 2002, produced three charting singles on the [[Hot Country Songs]] charts: \"[[That's Just Jessie]]\" at number 16, \"Cadillac Tears\" at number 30 and \"It'll Go Away\" at number 43.<ref name=\"whitburn\">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2008|publisher=Record Research, Inc|year=2008|page=122|isbn=978-0-89820-177-2}}</ref> He also contributed a rendition of \"[[White Christmas (song)|White Christmas]]\" to the label's multi-artist compilation ''No Wrapping Required''.<ref>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r552889|pure_url=yes}}|title=''No Wrapping Required'' review|last=Birchmeier|first=Jason|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=September 22, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn late 2003, Denney charted a fourth single, \"A Year at a Time,\" which peaked at number 44 on the country charts. The song did not appear on an album, and Denney exited the label.<ref name=\"whitburn\"/>\n\nHe co-wrote a track on [[Tracy Byrd]]'s 2006 album ''[[Different Things]]'', and [[Craig Morgan (singer)|Craig Morgan]]'s 2009 single \"[[Bonfire (Craig Morgan song)|Bonfire]].\" He also co-wrote \"Don't Ask Me About a Woman\", a song recorded by [[Easton Corbin]] on his 2010 [[Easton Corbin (album)|self-titled debut album]].\n\n==Discography==\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:12em;\"| Title\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:16em;\"| Album details\n! colspan=\"3\"| Peak chart positions\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n! width=\"45\"| [[Top Country Albums|US Country]]\n! width=\"45\"| [[Billboard 200|US]]\n! width=\"45\"| [[Top Heatseekers|US Heat]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[Kevin Denney (album)|Kevin Denney]]''\n| \n* Release date: April 23, 2002\n* Label: [[Lyric Street Records]]\n| 14\n| 119\n| 2\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Something in Between''\n| \n* Release date: June 24, 2016\n* Label: KDM Records\n| —\n| —\n| —\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" style=\"font-size:8pt\"| \"—\" denotes releases that did not chart\n|-\n|}\n\n===Singles===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Year\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:16em;\"| Single\n! colspan=\"2\"| Peak chart<br />positions\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Album\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n! width=\"45\"| [[Hot Country Songs|US Country]]\n! width=\"45\"| [[Billboard Hot 100|US]]\n|-\n| 2001\n! scope=\"row\"| \"[[That's Just Jessie]]\"\n| 16\n| 76\n| align=\"left\" rowspan=\"3\"| ''Kevin Denney''\n|-\n| 2002\n! scope=\"row\"| \"[[Cadillac Tears]]\"\n| 30\n| —\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 2003\n! scope=\"row\"| \"It'll Go Away\"\n| 43\n| —\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"A Year at a Time\"\n| 44\n| —\n| {{n/a}}\n|-\n| 2016\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Ain't Gonna Hurt Nobody but Me\"\n| —\n| —\n| align=\"left\"| ''Something in Between''\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" style=\"font-size:8pt\"| \"—\" denotes releases that did not chart\n|-\n|}\n\n===Music videos===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n!
