In addition, he holds the record for the most songs by a solo artist to hit number one on the [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart, with seven. Mellencamp has been nominated for 13 [[Grammy Awards]], winning one. He has sold over 60 million albums worldwide, with 30 million in the US. His latest album of original songs, ''[[Orpheus Descending (album)|Orpheus Descending]]'', was released in June 2023.\n\nMellencamp is also one of the founding members of [[Farm Aid]], an organization that began in 1985 with a concert in [[Champaign, Illinois]] to raise awareness about the loss of family farms and to raise funds to keep farm families on their land. Farm Aid concerts have remained an annual event over the past 37 years, and {{as of|2023|lc=y}} the organization has raised over $60&nbsp;million.\n\n==Early life==\nMellencamp was born in the small town of [[Seymour, Indiana]] on October 7, 1951. He is of [[German Americans|German]] and [[Dutch Americans|Dutch]] ancestry. He was born with [[spina bifida]], for which he had corrective surgery as an infant.

Mellencamp confessed in a 2005 interview:\n\n<blockquote>\"That [name] was put on me by some manager. I went to New York, and everybody said, 'You sound like a hillbilly.' And I said, 'Well, I am.' So that's where he came up with that name. I was totally unaware of it until it showed up on the album jacket. When I objected to it, he said, 'Well, either you're going to go for it, or we're not going to put the record out.' So that was what I had to do... but I thought the name was pretty silly.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://americansongwriter.com/john-mellencamp/ |title=John Mellencamp Interview| magazine=[[American Songwriter]]}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nMellencamp recorded ''[[The Kid Inside]]'', the follow-up to ''Chestnut Street Incident'', in 1977. However, DeFries eventually decided against releasing the album, and Mellencamp was dropped from MCA records (DeFries finally released ''[[The Kid Inside]]'' in early 1983, after Mellencamp achieved stardom). Mellencamp drew interest from [[Rod Stewart]]'s manager, Billy Gaff, after parting ways with DeFries and was signed onto the small [[Riva Records]] label. At Gaff's request, Mellencamp moved to London, England, for nearly a year to record, promote, and tour behind 1978's ''[[A Biography]]''. The record wasn't released in the United States, but it yielded a top-five hit in Australia with \"[[I Need a Lover]].\"<ref name=Wildcat/> Riva Records added \"I Need a Lover\" to Mellencamp's next album released in the United States, 1979's ''[[John Cougar (album)|John Cougar]]'', where the song became a No. 28 single in late 1979. [[Pat Benatar]] recorded \"I Need a Lover\" on her debut album ''[[In the Heat of the Night (Pat Benatar album)|In the Heat of the Night]]''.\n\nIn 1980, Mellencamp returned with the [[Steve Cropper]]-produced ''[[Nothin' Matters and What If It Did]]'', which yielded two Top 40 singles – \"This Time\" (No. 27) and \"Ain't Even Done With the Night\" (No. 17). \"The singles were stupid little pop songs,\" he told ''Record Magazine'' in 1983.\n\n<blockquote>\"I take no credit for that record. It wasn't like the title was made up – it wasn't supposed to be punky or cocky like some people thought. Toward the end, I didn't even go to the studio. Me and the guys in the band thought we were finished, anyway. It was the most expensive record I ever made. It cost $280,000, do you believe that? The worst thing was that I could have gone on making records like that for hundreds of years. Hell, as long as you sell a few records and the record company isn't putting a lot of money into promotion, you're making money for 'em and that's all they care about. PolyGram loved ''Nothin' Matters''. They thought I was going to turn into the next [[Neil Diamond]].\"</blockquote>\n\nIn 1982, Mellencamp released his breakthrough album, ''[[American Fool]]'', which contained the singles \"[[Hurts So Good]],\" an uptempo rock tune that spent four weeks at No. 2 and 16 weeks in the top 10, and \"[[Jack & Diane]],\" which was a No. 1 hit for four weeks. A third single, \"Hand to Hold on To,\" made it to No. 19. \"Hurts So Good\" went on to win the [[Grammy Award for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance]] at the 25th [[Grammys]].\n\n<blockquote>\"To be real honest, there's three good songs on that record, and the rest is just sort of filler. It was too labored over, too thought about, and it wasn't organic enough. The record company thought it would bomb, but I think the reason it took off was – not that the songs were better than my others – but people liked the sound of it, the 'bam-bam-bam' drums. It was a different sound.\"</blockquote>\n\n===1983–1990: Performing as John Cougar Mellencamp===\nWith some commercial success under his belt, Mellencamp had enough influence to force the record company to add his real surname, Mellencamp, to his stage moniker. The first album recorded under his new name John Cougar Mellencamp was 1983's ''[[Uh-Huh]]'', a Top-10 album that spawned the Top 10 singles \"[[Pink Houses]]\" and \"[[Crumblin' Down]]\" as well as the No. 15 hit \"Authority Song,\" which he said is \"our version of '[[I Fought the Law]].'\" During the recording of ''Uh-Huh'', Mellencamp's backing band settled on the lineup it retained for the next several albums: [[Kenny Aronoff]] on drums and percussion, [[Larry Crane (guitarist)|Larry Crane]] and Mike Wanchic on guitars, [[Toby Myers]] on bass and John Cascella on keyboards. In 1988, ''Rolling Stone'' magazine called this version of Mellencamp's band \"one of the most powerful and versatile live bands ever assembled.\" On the 1984 Uh-Huh Tour, Mellencamp opened his shows with cover versions of songs he admired growing up, including [[Elvis Presley]]'s \"[[Heartbreak Hotel]],\" [[the Animals]]' \"[[Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood]],\" [[Lee Dorsey]]'s \"[[Ya Ya]],\" and the [[Left Banke]]'s \"[[Pretty Ballerina]].\"\n\nIn 1985, Mellencamp released ''[[Scarecrow (John Mellencamp album)|Scarecrow]]'', which peaked at No. 2 in the fall of 1985 and spawned five Top 40 singles: \"[[Lonely Ol' Night]]\" and \"[[Small Town]]\" (both No. 6), \"[[R.O.C.K. in the U.S.A.]]\" (No. 2), \"Rain on the Scarecrow\" (No. 21) and \"Rumble Seat\" (No. 28). According to the February 1986 edition of ''Creem Magazine'', Mellencamp wanted to incorporate the sound of classic '60s rock into ''Scarecrow'', and he gave his band close to a hundred old singles to learn \"almost mathematically verbatim\" prior to recording the album.<ref name=\"Creem Magazine\">{{cite web |url=https://www.rocksbackpages.com/Library/Article/john-cougar-mellencamp-working-class-hero-in-the-rumbleseat |title=John Cougar Mellencamp: Working Class Hero In The Rumbleseat |work=Creem Magazine}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\"Learning those songs did a lot of positive things. We realized more than ever what a big melting pot of all different types of music the '60s were. Take an old [[The Rascals|Rascals]] song, for example – there's everything from marching band beats to soul music to country sounds in one song. Learning those opened the band's vision to try new things on my songs. It wasn't; let's go back and try to make this part fit into my song, but I wanted to capture the same feeling – the way those songs used to make you feel. After a while, we didn't even have to talk about it anymore. If you listen to the lead Larry [Crane] plays on 'Face of the Nation,' he never would have played that 'cause he didn't really know who [[The Animals]] were. He's young, and he grew up listening to [[Grand Funk Railroad]]. You hear it, and it's like 'where did that come from?' It had to be from hearing those old records.\"<ref name=\"Creem Magazine\"/></blockquote>\n\n''Scarecrow'' was the first album Mellencamp recorded at his own recording studio, jokingly dubbed \"[[Belmont Mall Studio|Belmont Mall]],\" located in [[Belmont, Indiana]], and constructed in 1984. Mellencamp sees ''Scarecrow'' as the start of the [[alternative country]] genre:\n\n<blockquote>\"I think I invented that whole 'No Depression' thing with the ''Scarecrow'' album, though I don't get the credit.\"<ref>[http://www.mellencamp.com/index.php?page=news&n_id=374 UK's Classic Rock Magazine In-depth Mellencamp Interview] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304031648/http://www.mellencamp.com/index.php?page=news&n_id=374 |date=March 4, 2016}} Classic Rock Magazine December 2008.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn the liner notes to Mellencamp's 2010 box set ''[[On the Rural Route 7609]]'', Anthony DeCurtis wrote of Mellencamp's influence on the No Depression movement:\n\n{{cquote|\"In finding his voice as a lyricist and activist, Mellencamp also crafted a more fitting musical vision for himself (in the mid-1980s). Within the context of what was still undeniably the sound of a rock & roll band, he began incorporating instruments more characteristic of folk and roots music—dulcimer, mandolin, fiddle, accordion, dobro, and pennywhistle, among them. On albums like ''Scarecrow'' (1985), ''The Lonesome Jubilee'' (1987), and ''Big Daddy'' (1989), Mellencamp helped pioneer the sound of alternative country or No Depression, music that combines the truth-telling force of hard-core country with the instrumental attack of rock & roll.\n\nIf he has not been properly credited for that groundbreaking role, it's largely because he committed the unforgivable sin of actually having hits while making innovative music. Part of the No Depression mythology requires either a tragic early death or decades of unacknowledged masterpieces created during a life of grueling poverty. Writing and recording great songs that millions of people like and buy is not part of that sentimental picture—regardless of how comfortably the music itself sits within the genre's parameters.\"}}\n\nShortly after finishing ''Scarecrow'', Mellencamp helped organize the first [[Farm Aid]] benefit concert with [[Willie Nelson]] and [[Neil Young]] in [[Champaign, Illinois]] on September 22, 1985. The Farm Aid concerts remain an annual event and have raised over $60&nbsp;million for struggling family farmers {{as of|2023|lc=y}}.\n\nPrior to the 1985–86 Scarecrow Tour, during which he covered some of the same 1960s rock and soul songs he and his band rehearsed prior to the recording of ''Scarecrow'', Mellencamp added fiddle player [[Lisa Germano]] to his band. Germano would remain in Mellencamp's band until 1994 when she left to pursue a solo career.\n\nMellencamp's next studio album, 1987's ''[[The Lonesome Jubilee]]'', included the singles \"[[Paper in Fire]]\" (No. 9), \"Cherry Bomb\" (No. 8), \"Check It Out\" (No. 14), and \"Rooty Toot Toot\" (No. 61) along with the popular album tracks \"Hard Times for an Honest Man\" and \"The Real Life\", both of which cracked the top 10 on the ''Billboard'' [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Album Rock Tracks]] chart.\n\n<blockquote>\"We were on the road for a long time after ''Scarecrow'', so we were together a lot as a band. For the first time ever, we talked about the record before we started. We had a very distinct vision of what should be happening here. At one point, ''[[The Lonesome Jubilee]]'' was supposed to be a double album, but at least 10 of the songs I'd written just didn't stick together with the idea and the sound we had in mind. So I just put those songs on a shelf, and cut it back down to a single record. Now, in the past, it was always 'Let's make it up as we go along' – and we did make some of ''The Lonesome Jubilee'' up as we went along. But we had a very clear idea of what we wanted it to sound like, even before it was written, right through to the day it was mastered.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rocksbackpages.com/Library/Article/john-cougar-mellencamp-growing-up-in-public|title=John Cougar Mellencamp: Growing Up In Public|work=Creem Magazine}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAs Frank DiGiacomo of ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' wrote in 2007, \"''The Lonesome Jubilee'' was the album in which Mellencamp defined his now signature sound: a rousing, crystalline mix of acoustic and electric guitars, Appalachian fiddle, and gospel-style backing vocals, anchored by a crisp, bare-knuckle drumbeat and completed by his own velveteen rasp.\"<ref name=\"frankdigiacomo.com\">{{cite news|url=http://www.frankdigiacomo.com/articles/2007/02/john_mellencamp.php|title=John Mellencamp: One from the Heartland | date=February 2007}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1987–88 Lonesome Jubilee Tour, Mellencamp was joined onstage by surprise guest [[Bruce Springsteen]] at the end of his May 26, 1988, gig in Irvine, California, for a duet of [[Bob Dylan]]'s \"[[Like a Rolling Stone]],\" which Mellencamp performed as the penultimate song during each show on that tour. Said Mellencamp of his band during the 1987-88 Lonesome Jubilee Tour:\n\n{{cquote|\"Just then, we were the best band in the world, bar none. I mean, we were ''really'' good. All of that failure and frustration had energized every guy in the band to the infantile level of, 'We're going to show 'em all they were wrong.' It wasn't just me. When we walked out onstage, there wasn't a band on Earth to touch us. And it don't matter who you care to name ― [[U2]], [[The Rolling Stones]], anybody. We were better. Now, we weren't playing the best songs in the world. A lot of my songs weren't that great, but they were good enough. And as far as putting on a performance and entertaining goes, we were undeniably great. I wish I would've been able to enjoy it, but I was too busy slugging.\"<ref name=\"Mellencamp: The Biography\">{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bxs-EAAAQBAJ|title=John Mellencamp: The Biography | date=September 2021|isbn=9781982112141 |last1=Rees |first1=Paul |publisher=Simon and Schuster }}</ref>}}\n\nIn 1989, Mellencamp released the personal album ''[[Big Daddy (John Mellencamp album)|Big Daddy]]'', with the key tracks \"Jackie Brown\", \"Big Daddy of Them All\", and \"Void in My Heart\" accompanying the Top 15 single \"Pop Singer\". The album, which Mellencamp called at the time the most \"earthy\" record he'd ever made, is also the last to feature the \"Cougar\" moniker. In 1991, Mellencamp said: \"'Big Daddy' was the best record I ever made. Out of my agony came a couple of really beautiful songs. You can't be 22 years old and had two dates and understand that album.\"<ref name=\"Associated Press\">{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1696&dat=19911227&id=TPkaAAAAIBAJ&pg=6735,8372406|title= Mellencamp Finds Peace of Mind|publisher=Bowling Green Daily News | date=December 27, 1991}}</ref>\n\nMellencamp was heavily involved in painting at this time in his life and decided not to tour behind ''Big Daddy''.\n\n<blockquote>\"What's the point?...

''Whenever We Wanted'' yielded the Top 40 hits \"Get a Leg Up\" and \"Again Tonight,\" but \"Last Chance,\" \"Love and Happiness,\" and \"Now More Than Ever\" all garnered significant airplay on rock radio.\n\n<blockquote>\"It's very rock 'n' roll. I just wanted to get back to the basics.\" - John Mellencamp</blockquote>\n\nIn 1993, he released ''[[Human Wheels]]'', and the title track peaked at No. 48 on the ''Billboard'' singles chart. \"To me, this record is very urban,\" Mellencamp told Billboard magazine of ''Human Wheels'' in the summer of 1993.\n\n<blockquote>\"We had a lot of discussions about the rhythm and blues music of the day. We explored what a lot of these (current) bands are doing – these young black bands that are doing more than just sampling.\" - John Mellencamp</blockquote>\n\nMellencamp's 1994 ''[[Dance Naked]]'' album included a cover of [[Van Morrison]]'s \"[[Wild Night]]\" as a duet with [[Meshell Ndegeocello]]. \"Wild Night\" became Mellencamp's biggest hit in years, peaking at No. 3 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The album also contained two protest songs in, \"L.U.V.\" and \"Another Sunny Day 12/25\", in addition to the title track, which hit No. 41 on the Hot 100 in the summer of 1994.\n\n<blockquote>\"This is as naked a rock record as you're going to hear. All the vocals are first or second takes, and half the songs don't even have bass parts. Others have just one guitar, bass, and drums, which I haven't done since ''American Fool''.\"</blockquote>\n\nWith guitarist Andy York now on board as Larry Crane's full-time replacement, Mellencamp launched his Dance Naked Tour in the summer of 1994 but had a minor heart attack after a show at Jones Beach in New York on August 8 of that year. That heart attack eventually forced him to cancel the last few weeks of the tour. He returned to the concert stage in early 1995 by playing a series of dates in small Midwestern clubs under the pseudonym Pearl Doggy.\n\nIn September 1996, the experimental album ''[[Mr. Happy Go Lucky]]'', which was produced by [[Junior Vasquez]], was released to critical acclaim.\n\n<blockquote>\"It's been fascinating to me how urban records use rhythm and electronics, and it's terribly challenging to make that work in the context of a rock band. But we took it further than an urban record. The arrangements are more ambitious, with programs and loops going right along with real drums and guitars.\"</blockquote>\n\n''Mr. Happy Go Lucky'' spawned the No. 14 single \"[[Key West Intermezzo (I Saw You First)]]\" (Mellencamp's last Top 40 hit) and \"Just Another Day,\" which peaked at No. 46.\n\n===1998–2003: Recording for Columbia===\n[[File:Mellencamp sept2000.JPG|thumb|Mellencamp performing in 2000]]\nAfter the release of ''Mr. Happy Go Lucky'' and a subsequent four-month tour from March to July 1997 to promote it, Mellencamp signed a four-album deal with [[Columbia Records]], although he wound up making only three albums for the label.\n\nIssued a day before his 47th birthday in 1998, his [[John Mellencamp (album)|self-titled debut]] for Columbia Records included the singles \"Your Life Is Now\" and \"I'm Not Running Anymore,\" along with standout album tracks such as \"Eden Is Burning,\" \"Miss Missy,\" \"It All Comes True\" and \"Chance Meeting at the Tarantula\". The switch in labels coincided with Dane Clark replacing Aronoff on drums. \"On this record, we ended up quite a bit away from where we started,\" Mellencamp told Guitar World Acoustic in 1998.\n\n<blockquote>\"Initially, I wanted to make a record that barely had drums on it. Donovan made a record (in 1966), ''[[Sunshine Superman (album)|Sunshine Superman]]'', and I wanted to start with that same kind of vibe—Eastern, very grand stories, fairy tales.\"</blockquote>\n\nIn 1999, Mellencamp covered his own songs as well as those by Bob Dylan and [[the Drifters]] for his album ''[[Rough Harvest]]'' (recorded in 1997), one of two albums he owed Mercury Records to fulfill his contract (the other was ''[[The Best That I Could Do]]'', a best-of collection). In May 2000, he gave the Indiana University commencement address, in which he advised graduates to \"play it as you feel it!\" and that \"you'll be all right.\" Following the delivery of his address, Indiana University bestowed upon him an honorary Doctorate of Musical Arts.\n\nIn August 2000, Mellencamp played a series of unannounced free concerts in major cities on the East Coast and in the Midwest as a way of giving back to fans who had supported him the previous 24 years. With a lo-fi setup that included portable amps and a battery-powered P.A. system, Mellencamp, armed with an acoustic guitar and accompanied only by an accordionist and a violist, dubbed the jaunt \"Live in the Streets: The Good Samaritan Tour.\" At these dozen shows, which ranged from 45 to 60 minutes, Mellencamp covered several rock and folk classics and sprinkled in a few of his own songs.\n\n<blockquote>\"Nobody's selling anything, there's no souvenirs—except what's in everybody's heart. Think about it: Isn't that where music started? To anybody who's said thank you to me, I say, 'You're very nice, but, really, thank you.'\"<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZhAEAAAAMBAJ&q=Mellencamp%27s+Acoustic+Samaritans&pg=PA7-IA4|title=Mellencamp's Acoustic Samaritans|publisher=Billboard Magazine|date=August 26, 2000}}</ref></blockquote> In 2001, Mellencamp partnered with [[Turner Classic Movies]] to release a documentary of the tour on [[YouTube]].\n\nIn the early 21st century, Mellencamp teamed up with artists such as [[Chuck D]] and [[India.Arie]] to deliver his second Columbia album, ''[[Cuttin' Heads]]'' and the single \"[[Peaceful World (John Mellencamp song)|Peaceful World]]\". ''Cuttin' Heads'' also included a duet with [[Trisha Yearwood]] on a love song called \"Deep Blue Heart\".\n\n<blockquote>\"He played me this song, and he said, 'I kind of have an idea of like when [[Emmylou Harris]] sang on Bob Dylan's record, just kind of harmony all the way through.'\" -Yearwood </blockquote>\n\nMellencamp embarked on the Cuttin' Heads Tour in the summer of 2001, before the album was even released. He opened each show on this tour with a cover of the [[Rolling Stones]]' \"[[Gimme Shelter]]\" and also played a solo acoustic version of the ''Cuttin' Heads'' track \"Women Seem\" at each show.\n\nIn October 2002, Mellencamp performed the [[Robert Johnson]] song \"Stones in My Passway\" at two benefit concerts for his friend, ''Billboard'' magazine editor-in-chief [[Timothy White (editor)|Timothy White]], who died from a heart attack in 2002.\n\nColumbia Records executives, who were in attendance at the benefit shows, were so impressed with Mellencamp's live renditions of \"Stones in My Passway\" that they convinced him to record an album of vintage American songs, which ultimately became ''[[Trouble No More]]''. The album was a quickly recorded collection of [[folk music|folk]] and [[blues]] covers originally done by artists such as [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]], [[Son House]], [[Lucinda Williams]] and [[Hoagy Carmichael]]. ''[[Trouble No More]]'' was released in 2003,  dedicated to Mellencamp's friend Timothy White, and spent several weeks at No. 1 on ''Billboard''{{'}}s Blues Album charts. Mellencamp sang the [[Gospel music|gospel]] song \"Will The Circle Be Unbroken\" at White's funeral on July 2, 2002.\n\n===2004–2007: ''Words and Music'' and ''Freedom's Road''===\nMellencamp participated in the [[Vote for Change]] tour in October 2004 leading up to the [[2004 U.S. Presidential election]]. That same month he released the two-disc career hits retrospective ''[[Words & Music: John Mellencamp's Greatest Hits]]'', which contained 35 of his radio singles (including all 22 of his Top 40 hits) along with two new tunes, \"[[Walk Tall (John Mellencamp song)|Walk Tall]]\" and \"Thank You\" – both produced by [[Kenneth \"Babyface\" Edmonds|Babyface]] but written by Mellencamp.\n\nIn 2005, Mellencamp toured with [[Donovan]] and [[John Fogerty]]. The first leg of what was called the Words and Music Tour in the spring of 2005 featured Donovan playing in the middle of Mellencamp's set. Mellencamp would play a handful of songs before introducing Donovan and then duetting with him on the 1966 hit \"Sunshine Superman\". Mellencamp would leave the stage as Donovan played seven or eight of his songs (backed by Mellencamp's band) and then return to finish off his own set after Donovan departed. On the second leg of the tour in the summer of 2005, Fogerty co-headlined with Mellencamp at outdoor amphitheaters across the United States. Fogerty would join Mellencamp for duets on Fogerty's [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]] hit \"Green River\" and Mellencamp's \"Rain on the Scarecrow\".\n\n[[File:JohnMellencampWalterReedCenter.jpg|300px|left|thumb|Mellencamp (right) and his band perform at [[Walter Reed Army Medical Center]] in 2007.]]\n\nMellencamp released ''[[Freedom's Road]]'', his first album of original material in over five years, on January 23, 2007. He intended for ''[[Freedom's Road]]'' to have a 1960s rock sound while still remaining contemporary, and he feels that goal was achieved.\n\n<blockquote>\"We wanted to make sure that it had the same feeling of some of the great songs from the '60s but also had the message of today and had the backbeat of today. I think we came up with a pretty timeless-sounding album\".</blockquote>\n\n\"Our Country,\" the first single from ''[[Freedom's Road]]'', was played as the opening song on Mellencamp's 2006 spring tour, and the band that opened for him on that tour, [[Little Big Town]], was called on to record harmonies on the studio version of \"Our Country\", as well as seven other songs on ''Freedom's Road''.\n\nAlthough Mellencamp had always been outspoken and adamant about not selling any of his songs to corporations for commercial use, he changed his stance and let Chevrolet use \"Our Country\" in Chevy Silverado TV commercials that began airing in late September 2006.\n\n<blockquote>\"I agonized. I still don't think we should have to do it, but record companies can't spend money to promote records anymore, unless you're [[U2]] or [[Madonna]]. I'm taking heat because no one's ever done this before. People have licensed songs that have already been hits, but nobody's licensed a brand-new song to a major company, and people don't know how to react.\"</blockquote>\n\nMellencamp sang \"Our Country\" to open Game 2 of the [[2006 World Series]], and the song was nominated for a 2008 Grammy Award in the Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance category but lost to [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s \"Radio Nowhere.\" ''Freedom's Road'' peaked at No. 5 on the ''Billboard'' 200 album chart by selling 56,000 copies in its first week on the market.\n\n===2008–2013: The T Bone Burnett Era===\nOn August 13, 2007, Mellencamp began recording his 18th album of original material, titled ''[[Life, Death, Love and Freedom]]''. The album, released on July 15, 2008, was produced by [[T Bone Burnett]]. The first song with video, \"Jena,\" was introduced on Mellencamp's website in October 2007. In an interview with the ''Bloomington Herald-Times'' in March 2008, Mellencamp dubbed ''[[Life, Death, Love and Freedom]]'' \"The best record I've ever made.\" He signed with [[Starbucks]]' [[Hear Music]] label to distribute the album and said, \"They think it's a fucking masterpiece.\" The album's first single was \"My Sweet Love\". A video for the song was filmed in Savannah, Georgia, on June 9, 2008. Karen Fairchild of [[Little Big Town]] is featured in the video. She harmonizes with Mellencamp on \"My Sweet Love\". She also provides background vocals to three other songs on ''Life, Death, Love and Freedom'', which became the ninth Top 10 album of Mellencamp's career when it debuted at No. 7 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] the week of August 2, 2008. Like ''Freedom's Road'', ''Life, Death, Love and Freedom'' sold 56,000 copies in its first week. In its list of the 50 best albums of 2008, ''Rolling Stone'' magazine named ''Life, Death, Love and Freedom'' No. 5 overall and also dubbed \"Troubled Land\" No. 48 among the 100 best singles of the year.\n\n[[File:Mellencamp-Crow.jpg|200px|right|thumb|John Mellencamp and Sheryl Crow perform Mellencamp's 2008 single \"My Sweet Love\" in the [[Hunter Region]], [[New South Wales]], Australia on November 29, 2008.]]\nOn September 23, 2008, Mellencamp filmed a concert at the Crump Theatre in Columbus, Indiana, for a new A&E Biography series called ''Homeward Bound''. The show featured performers returning to small venues where they performed early in their careers. The program aired on December 11, 2008, and featured an in-depth documentary tracing Mellencamp's roots.\n\nMellencamp participated in a tribute concert for [[Pete Seeger]]'s 90th birthday on May 3, 2009, at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York City, which raised funds for an environmental organization founded by Seeger to preserve and protect the [[Hudson River]]. Mellencamp performed solo acoustic renditions of Seeger and Lee Hays' \"[[If I Had a Hammer]]\" and his own \"A Ride Back Home.\"\n\nWhile he was on tour, Mellencamp recorded a new album titled ''[[No Better Than This]]'' that was again produced by [[T Bone Burnett]]. The tracks for the album were recorded at historic locations, such as the [[First African Baptist Church (Savannah, Georgia)|First African Baptist Church]] in [[Savannah, Georgia]] as well as at the [[Sun Studio]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] and the Sheraton [[Gunter Hotel]] in [[San Antonio]] where blues pioneer [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]] recorded \"Sweet Home Chicago\" and \"Crossroad Blues\". Mellencamp recorded the album using a 1955 [[Ampex]] portable recording machine and only one microphone, requiring all the musicians to gather together around the mic. The album was recorded in mono. Mellencamp wrote over 30 songs for the record (only 13 made the final cut), and he wrote one song specifically for Room 414 at the Gunter Hotel Mellencamp told the ''San Antonio Express-News'':\n\n{{cquote|\"It's called 'Right Behind Me.' I wrote it just for this room. I could have done this in my studio. But I want to do it this way, and if I can't do what I want at this point, I'm not going to do it. If it's not fun, I'm not going to do it. I'm through digging a ditch.\"}}  ''[[No Better Than This]]'' was released on August 17, 2010, and peaked at No. 10 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], becoming the 10th Top 10 album of his career. ''No Better Than This'' is the first mono-only release to make the top 10 since [[James Brown]]'s ''Pure Dynamite! Live at the Royal'', which peaked at No. 10 in April 1964.\n\nOn December 6, 2009, Mellencamp performed \"[[Born in the U.S.A. (song)|Born in the U.S.A.]]\" as a tribute to Bruce Springsteen, who was one of the honorees at the 2009 [[Kennedy Center Honors]]. \"I was very proud and humbled to have been able to play 'Born in the U.S.A.' in a different fashion that I think was true to the feelings that Bruce had when he wrote it, \"Mellencamp said. He performed \"Down by the River\" on January 29, 2010, in Los Angeles in tribute to [[Neil Young]], who was honored at the 20th annual MusiCares Person of the Year gala. Mellencamp sang the hymn \"[[Keep Your Eyes on the Prize]]\" at \"In Performance at the White House: A Celebration of Music from the Civil Rights Movement\" on February 9, 2010.\n\nMellencamp, who co-headlined 11 shows in the summer of 2010 with [[Bob Dylan]], launched the ''No Better Than This'' theater tour on October 29, 2010, in [[Bloomington, Indiana]]. On this tour, which ran through the summer of 2012 and covered the entire United States, Canada, and much of Europe, Mellencamp opened each concert with a showing of a Kurt Markus documentary about the making of ''No Better Than This'' called \"It's About You\" before hitting the stage to play three different sets: a stripped-down acoustic set with his band, a solo acoustic set, and a fully electrified rock set. \"It'll be like [[Alan Freed]], like the old Moondog shows,\" Mellencamp told Billboard magazine prior to the tour: {{cquote|\"When you went to see his shows, there was a movie like ''The Girl Can't Help It'' or something, and then three or four bands played. I'm gonna come out and play with upright bass and cocktail [drum] kits and a lot of acoustic instruments. I'll play for, like, 40 minutes that way. Then the band will leave and it'll just be me with an acoustic guitar for 40 minutes, and then there'll be 40 minutes of rock 'n' roll. You'll get three different types of John Mellencamp, and you'll get a movie.\"}} Mellencamp played for over two hours and included 24 songs on his tour's setlist. He brought the ''[[No Better Than This]]'' tour to Europe in the summer of 2011, opening in [[Copenhagen]] on June 24. One reviewer called the opening gig of the European leg of the tour \"maybe the best rock performance ever in Denmark.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.torbenbille.dk/kritik/mellencamp-absolut-live/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624161204/http://www.torbenbille.dk/kritik/mellencamp-absolut-live/|url-status=dead|title=Mellencamp absolut live &#124; MIDT I EN BEATTID|archive-date=June 24, 2016}}</ref> The ''[[No Better Than This]]'' Tour returned to the U.S. for one final round of shows from October 25 to November 19, 2011.

In a September 2020 interview, Mellencamp guitarist Andy York said that ten songs have already been recorded and mixed for the album. However, a planned final session in April 2020 to complete the project was scuttled because of the [[COVID-19]] pandemic. During the pandemic, Mellencamp wrote at least 15 songs.

He also revealed that the album had the working title of ''[[Strictly a One-Eyed Jack]]''.

The tour wrapped up on June 27 in [[Milwaukee]]. Mellencamp debuted \"Hey God\" and \"The Eyes of Portland,\" two songs from ''Orpheus Descending'', in his 2023 live set. \"Hey God\" is the album's first single and was released on April 21, 2023, followed by \"The Eyes of Portland\" as the second single on May 12, 2023.\n\nThe Live and In Person tour marked the return of violinist [[Lisa Germano]] to Mellencamp's band. Germano played with Mellencamp from 1985-1993 before leaving in 1994 to pursue a solo career. Germano also played violin on ''Orpheus Descending'', marking the first Mellencamp studio album she has played on since 1993's ''[[Human Wheels]]''.\n\n===Collaboration with George Green===\nMellencamp co-wrote several of his best-known songs with his childhood friend [[George Green (songwriter)|George Green]], who, like Mellencamp, was born and raised in Seymour, Indiana. Green contributed lyrics to numerous Mellencamp radio hits and classic album tracks, including \"Human Wheels,\" \"Minutes to Memories,\" \"Hurts So Good,\" \"Crumblin' Down,\" \"Rain on the Scarecrow,\" \"Your Life is Now,\", and \"Key West Intermezzo,\" in addition to songs recorded by Barbra Streisand, Hall & Oates, Jude Cole, Ricky Skaggs, Sue Medley, The Oak Ridge Boys, Percy Sledge, and Carla Olson.\n\nMellencamp and Green's final collaboration was \"Yours Forever,\" a song that was included on the soundtrack to the 2000 movie ''[[The Perfect Storm (film)|The Perfect Storm]]''. Mellencamp and Green had a falling out in the early 2000s, and Green ultimately moved from [[Bloomington, Indiana]] to [[Taos, New Mexico]] in 2001. \"Like when you're married, when you're friends with somebody for a long time, the more things build up, the more things can go wrong,\" Mellencamp said in the liner notes to his 2010 box set, ''[[On the Rural Route 7609]]''. \"There were personal problems, cross-pollinated with professional issues. George has written some great lyrics and we've written some great songs together, but I just couldn't do it any more.\"\n\nOn August 28, 2011, Green died in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]] at the age of 59 after losing a battle with a rapid-forming small-cell lung cancer. \"I've known George since we were in the same Sunday school class. We had a lot of fun together when we were kids. Later on, we wrote some really good songs together,\" Mellencamp told the ''Bloomington Herald Times'' shortly after Green's death. \"George was a dreamer, and I was sorry to hear of his passing.\"<ref name=\"Bloomington Herald Times\">[https://archive.today/20130103053512/http://www.heraldtimesonline.com/stories/2011/08/30/scene.qp-8782469.sto Songwriter, Mellencamp collaborator George Green dies at 59].

Mellencamp's best music is rock 'n roll stripped of all escapism, and it looks directly at the messiness of life as it's actually lived.

Meanwhile, the piano-heavy \"Seeing You Around\" has the sound of a 1940s standard (the movie takes place during [[World War II]]) and is made all the more authentically '40s-sounding by Redbone's gruff baritone vocals.

The soundtrack includes [[Rosanne Cash]], [[Sheryl Crow]], [[Elvis Costello]], [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]], [[Ryan Bingham]], [[Will Dailey]] and [[Neko Case]] among others singing the songs Mellencamp wrote.\n\nIn November 2010, Mellencamp told the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'':{{cquote|\"T Bone and I and Stephen King are working on a musical. All the music has been recorded. We had Kris Kristofferson, Neko Case, Elvis Costello, and Taj Mahal, all singing different characters' roles. I wrote all the songs, 17 songs. (T Bone) produced. It sounds like the 'Sgt. Pepper' of Americana to me. Forget about the play, just the songs, the way these people sing them. I'm sitting there listening to it and thinking, \"Did Rosanne Cash just kill that song or what!\" The play is called \"Ghost Brothers of Darkland County\", about two brothers who hate each other. If you could imagine Tennessee Williams meets Stephen King. They're recording the dialogue now and we're putting out a record of the entire show before it comes out. Right now, Elvis Costello, Meg Ryan, Kris Kristofferson and Matthew McConaughey are doing table readings like an old radio play. So you'll get all the dialogue, all the sound effects, and all the songs sung by different people so you can follow the story. The CD will come out ahead of time. So many people are involved, it's taken a long time. But we don't have to worry about money or record companies – it's our own money we're putting into it, so we said, let's just make something beautiful.\"}}\n\nRyan D'Agostino of ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' stated in a review of a New York rehearsal of ''Ghost Brothers of Darkland County'' in the fall of 2007, \"Musicals aren't usually a guy thing. This one, though, is not only tolerable, it's good. It may be the first-ever musical written by men for men. There's no orchestra, just two twangy acoustic guitars, an accordion, and a fiddle.

The question is whether or not he can bring himself to tell the truth in time to save his own troubled sons and whether the ghosts left behind by an act of violence will help him – or tear the McCandless family apart forever.}}\n\n''Ghost Brothers of Darkland County'' received mixed reviews upon its initial run in Atlanta. The musical toured 20 U.S. cities as a \"radio play\" in the fall of 2013 and toured 18 more cities across the U.S. in the fall of 2014.
