Lead vocalist Trent Summar and his friend Eddie Grigg owned a [[farmhouse]] in [[Lascassas, Tennessee]], where they began working on music together. They began working with other musicians until they decided to form a band. The band's name originated when a friend of Summar's gave him a [[plastic flamingo]] as a gift, which he mounted inside the farmhouse next to a portrait of [[Hank Williams]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/496800550/ | title=Honest, downhome, and crazy | work=[[The Leader-Post]] | date=July 11, 1994 | accessdate=May 30, 2022 | pages=C3}}</ref>\n\nBy 1993, they were signed to a recording contract with [[Giant Records (Warner Bros. subsidiary label)|Giant Records Nashville]], who released the band's eponymous debut album the following year.
