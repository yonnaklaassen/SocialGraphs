Though probably best known for his fluid renditions of classic fiddle tunes transcribed for the guitar (\"Fiddler's Dram/Whiskey Before Breakfast\"), Blake has also written songs that have become bluegrass and folk standards, such as \"Ginseng Sullivan\", \"Slow Train through Georgia\", \"Billy Gray\", and \"Church Street Blues\".\n\nBlake has also written and published songs of a political nature, such as \"Don’t Be Afraid of the Neo-Cons.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nBlake is known for his tastefully simple-sounding style, saying, \"I’m more interested in the music and the tone than I am the licks.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |last=Campbell |first=Phil |date=2007-11-21 |title=Interview: Norman Blake |url=https://www.fretboardjournal.com/features/interview-norman-blake/ |access-date=2022-11-28 |website=Fretboard Journal |language=en}}</ref>\n\nAlthough known as one of the most prominent steel-string guitar [[flatpicking|flatpickers]], Blake is a multi-instrumentalist and vocalist.
