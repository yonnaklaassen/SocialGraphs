In 1952, he released his first No. 1 country song, \"[[I'll Go On Alone]]\". Four years later, he released his second No.1 hit \"[[Singing the Blues]]\", and one year later, released two more No. 1 hits, \"[[A White Sport Coat]]\" and \"[[The Story of My Life (Marty Robbins song)|The Story of My Life]]\". In 1959, Robbins released his signature song, \"[[El Paso (song)|El Paso]]\", for which he won the [[Grammy Award for Best Country & Western Recording]]. The song began Robbins' association with [[Western music (North America)|western]] balladry, a style which would become a staple of his career. Later releases that drew critical acclaim include \"[[Don't Worry (Marty Robbins song)|Don't Worry]]\", \"[[Big Iron]]\", \"[[Devil Woman (Marty Robbins song)|Devil Woman]]\" and \"Honkytonk Man\", the last for which the [[Honkytonk Man|1982 Clint Eastwood film]] is named, and in which Robbins made his final appearance before his death.\n\nOver the course of his career, Robbins recorded more than [[Marty Robbins discography|500 songs and 60 albums]], and won two [[Grammy Awards]], was elected to the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] and [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]], and was named the 1960s Artist of the Decade by the [[Academy of Country Music]]. His songs \"El Paso\" and \"Big Iron\" were ranked by the [[Western Writers of America]] among the Top 100 Western songs of all time. Robbins was a commercial success in both the country and pop genres, and his songs were covered by many other famous artists, including [[Johnny Cash]], the [[Grateful Dead]] and [[Elvis Presley]].

Robbins belonged to the [[Jim Reeves]] era and wore his embroidered cowboy suits proudly. Best known for the western ballad, ''El Paso'', his career also touched the [[Rock and roll|rock 'n' roll]] side of [[Country music|country]] in songs like ''White Sport Coat And A Pink Carnation'', and he kept a touch of the dude about him to the end.</blockquote>\n\nIn 1980, Robbins appeared on the [[PBS]] music program ''[[Austin City Limits]]'' (season 5).

He held Robbins in high esteem, having him guest several times on [[The Johnny Cash Show (TV series)|his network TV show]]. \"Big Iron\" was also covered by [[Mike Ness]] on his album ''[[Under the Influences]]'', on which he paid homage to country music artists.

With his musical successes, he was able to finance his avocation.  Robbins always tried to run at the big race tracks ([[Talladega Superspeedway]], [[Daytona International Speedway]]) every year and a smattering of the smaller races when time permitted. Robbins had 6 top-ten finishes in his career, with a personal best top 5 finish at the 1974 [[Motor State 360]] in Michigan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.racing-reference.info/race/1974_Motor_State_360/W |date=June 16, 1974 |title=1974 Motor State 360 |work=racing-reference.info |access-date=February 17, 2021}}</ref>\n\nRobbins' cars were built and maintained by [[Cotton Owens]].  They were painted two-toned magenta and chartreuse, usually carrying car number 42 (though 6, 22, and 777 were also used).  Over the years, he ran a few makes and models ([[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]]s, [[Dodge]]s or [[Ford Motor Company|Fords]]) before buying a 1972-bodied [[Dodge Charger]] from Owens. Robbins had a few major wrecks during the 1970s, and he had Owens rebuild the car to update the sheet metal to the 1973–1974 Charger specifications, and then finally 1978 [[Dodge Magnum]] sheet metal, which he raced until the end of 1980. Robbins' final NASCAR race car was a 1981 [[Buick Regal]] that he rented and drove in a few races in 1981 and 1982.\n\nIn 1972, at the [[1972 Winston 500|Winston 500]], Robbins stunned the competition by turning laps that were 15&nbsp;mph faster than his qualifying time. After the race, NASCAR tried to bestow the Rookie of the Race award, but he would not accept it. He had knocked the [[NASCAR]]-mandated restrictors out of his [[carburetor]] and admitted he \"just wanted to see what it was like to run up front for once.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cottonowens.com/drivers/Marty_Robbins.php |title=Cotton Owens Garage – Drivers |publisher=Cotton Owens Garage and Stratatomic LLC |access-date=2015-08-17}}</ref>\n\nRobbins is credited with possibly saving [[Richard Childress]]' life at the 1974 Charlotte 500 by deliberately crashing into a wall rather than t-bone (broadside) Childress's car that was stopped across the track.\n\nIn 1983, one year after Robbins' death, NASCAR honored him by naming the annual race at [[Fairgrounds Speedway]] the [[Coors 420|Marty Robbins 420]].\n\nRobbins' Dodge Magnum was restored by Owens and donated to the Talladega Museum by his family, and was displayed there from 1983 to 2008.  The car is now in private hands in [[Southern California]] and raced on the Vintage [[NASCAR]] club circuit.\n\nIn 2014, Robbins' 1969 [[Dodge Charger Daytona]] was featured on an episode of [[Discovery Channel]]s TV show ''Fat and Furious: Rolling Thunder''. In that same year, an episode of [[Velocity]]'s ''AmeriCarna'' featured ex-race team owner [[Ray Evernham]] spearheading the restoration of another of Robbins' [[NASCAR]] racers, a 1964 [[Plymouth Belvedere]].\n\nFor the 2016 [[Darlington Raceway|Darlington]] throwback weekend, [[Kyle Larson]]'s No. 42 [[NASCAR]] [[Xfinity Series]] car was painted purple and gold in honor of Robbins. For the [[2021 Goodyear 400]], [[Tyler Reddick]]'s RCR #8 [[Nascar]] Cup car carries Robbins' signature magenta and chartreuse livery. For the [[2022 Goodyear 400|2022 running]], [[Corey LaJoie]]'s [[Spire Motorsports]] #7 ran a throwback to Robbins' infamous 777 car that he ran in his career.\n\n==Discography==\n{{main|Marty Robbins discography}}\nRobbins' discography consists of 52 studio albums, 13 [[compilation album]]s, and 100 singles. In his career, Robbins charted 17 Number One singles on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts, as well as 82 Top 40 singles.\n\nRobbins' highest-charting album is 1959's ''[[Gunfighter Ballads and Trail Songs]]''. It charted to #6 on the all-genre [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], and was also certified Platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]. The album's first single, \"[[El Paso (song)|El Paso]]\", became a hit on both the country and pop charts, charting to Number One on the Hot Country Songs as well as the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. While that would be his only pop Number One, in 1957, \"[[A White Sport Coat]]\" charted to #2, and in 1961, \"[[Don't Worry (Marty Robbins song)|Don't Worry]]\" charted to #3.\n\nHis final Top 10 single was \"Honkytonk Man\" from the 1982 [[Honkytonk Man|eponymous film]] in which Robbins had a role.  He died shortly before its release.  Since his death, four [[Posthumous publication|posthumous]] studio albums have been released, but they made no impact on the charts.\n\n==Filmography==\n\n*''[[The Badge of Marshal Brennan]]'' (1957, 74 minutes) as Felipe, a Mexican outlaw<ref name= \"Pruett\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=otDFSIwdsSIC&dq=%22Badge+of+Marshal+Brennan%22&pg=PA354 Barbara J.
