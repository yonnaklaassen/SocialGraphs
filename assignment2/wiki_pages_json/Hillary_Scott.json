She is signed to [[Big Machine Records]].\n\nIn collaboration with her family, Scott released the [[Gospel music|gospel]] album ''[[Love Remains (Hillary Scott album)|Love Remains]]'' in 2016 as a solo artist. The album reached number 7 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].\n\n==Early life==\nScott was born in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], to country music artist [[Linda Davis]] and Lang Scott, a musician and entrepreneur.  She has a younger sister named Rylee Jean, who was born in 2000. She is of Scottish and Native American descent. Scott was homeschooled on the road for kindergarten. She attended elementary school and high school at [[Donelson Christian Academy]] where she graduated in 2004. She lived with her grandparents during the time her parents were touring for her mother's musical career. After joining her mom on stage for a Christmas show, she was convinced to pursue a music career. Scott decided at age 14 to become a country singer, and her sister, Rylee, is 14 years younger than her; so she has a tattoo of the number 14 in honor of those two things.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.homecomingmagazine.com/article/treasures-linda-davis/|title=Treasures: Linda Davis &#124; Homecoming Magazine|website=Homecomingmagazine.com}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nAfter high school Hillary Scott attended [[Middle Tennessee State University]].

She ran into Kelley at a Nashville bar and recognized him from his [[MySpace]] page, where she had been listening to his music. She introduced herself to Kelley and complimented him on his music, which led to his deciding that they should get together with Haywood and write songs. The first song they wrote was \"All We'd Ever Need\". The song was originally written for her to perform; she convinced Kelley it should be a duet, which led to the forming of [[Lady A]], then known as Lady Antebellum. The group first performed together in August 2006 and signed a record deal with Capitol Nashville in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hillary Scott/Lady Antebellum|url=http://www.digitalrodeo.com/HillaryScottLadyAntebellum#fbid=U8pxKPxWoGm|publisher=Digital Rodeo|access-date=July 2, 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907044202/http://www.digitalrodeo.com/HillaryScottLadyAntebellum#fbid=U8pxKPxWoGm|archive-date=September 7, 2008}}</ref> Scott says that being<!--to avoid false positives in search for 'being led/lead' typo --> lead singer of Lady A, as opposed to being a solo artist, lessens the pressure on her on stage.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lady Antebellum Biography|url=http://www.gactv.com/gac/ar_artists_a-z/article/0,,GAC_26071_5788001,00.html|publisher=[[Great American Country|GAC]]|access-date=May 7, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110624182814/http://www.gactv.com/gac/ar_artists_a-z/article/0,,gac_26071_5788001,00.html|archive-date=June 24, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Lady Antebellum===\n{{Main|Lady A}}\nScott formed the country music group as Lady Antebellum in 2006, with co-lead singer [[Charles Kelley]] and backup singer [[Dave Haywood]].
