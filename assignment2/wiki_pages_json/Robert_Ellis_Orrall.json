Signed to RCA Records in 1980, Orrall debuted that year with the album \"Fixation\". His first Top 40 single was \"I Couldn't Say No\", a duet with [[Carlene Carter]]. By 1990, Orrall had found success as a songwriter, having penned Number One singles for [[Shenandoah (band)|Shenandoah]] and [[Clay Walker]]. He returned to RCA in 1991 and charted the singles \"Boom! It Was Over\" (#19) and \"A Little Bit of Her Love\" (#31), from his first [[country music]] album, ''[[Flying Colors (Robert Ellis Orrall album)|Flying Colors]]''. Orrall then joined frequent songwriting partner [[Curtis Wright]] in the CMA-nominated duo [[Orrall & Wright]], recording one more album and charting two singles. They split up in 1994, however, and Orrall returned to his solo career, writing singles for [[Reba McEntire]], [[Taylor Swift]], and [[Lindsay Lohan]], as well as producing records for Swift, [[Be Your Own Pet]],  and [[Love and Theft (band)|Love and Theft]]. He also performs and records as an [[indie rock]] musician in the band Monkey Bowl.\n\n==Musical career==\n===Beginnings===\nBorn in [[Winthrop, Massachusetts]], Orrall got his musical start playing in various [[Boston, Massachusetts]], area clubs. He signed with RCA in 1980 as a rock artist. His three RCA albums, ''Fixation'', ''Special Pain'' and ''Contain Yourself'' were supported by band mates Kook Lawry on guitar, Don Walden on bass, David Stefanelli on drums and [[Brian Maes]] on keys with tours opening for [[U2]], [[The Kinks]], and [[NRBQ]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://robertellisorrall.com/|title=Robert Ellis Orrall|website=Robertellisorrall.com}}</ref> Orrall's ''Special Pain'' also produced his first chart single in \"I Couldn't Say No\", a duet with [[Carlene Carter]] (also her first chart hit) which peaked in the Top 40 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref name=\"peer\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.peermusic.com/artistpage/Robert_Ellis_Orrall.html|title=Robert Ellis Orrall @ peermusic - The Independent Major|date=25 March 2002|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020325053836/http://www.peermusic.com/artistpage/Robert_Ellis_Orrall.html|access-date=27 January 2021|archive-date=2002-03-25}}</ref> Carter, like Orrall, would eventually become a country music star in her own right.\n\n===Nashville===\nOrrall eventually gained an interest in country music through such acts as [[Steve Earle]], [[Lyle Lovett]], and [[Foster & Lloyd]].<ref name=\"peer\"/> He then moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]],<ref name=\"oldies\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.oldies.com/artist-view/Robert-Ellis-Orrall.html|title=Robert Ellis Orrall|website=Oldies.com}}</ref> intending to use his songwriting and record producing skills.<ref name=\"peer\"/> One of his first cuts was [[Shenandoah (band)|Shenandoah]]'s \"[[Next to You, Next to Me]]\", which Orrall co-wrote with [[Curtis Wright]].<ref name=\"oldies\"/>\n\nShortly after his song topped the charts, Orrall's publisher BMG Music urged him to perform his songs at The Bluebird Cafe in Nashville. He was then offered a second record deal with RCA.<ref name=\"peer\"/> Titled ''[[Flying Colors (Robert Ellis Orrall album)|Flying Colors]]'', Orrall's first and only solo country album produced three charting singles, including a Top 20 in \"Boom! It Was Over\", as well as \"A Little Bit of Her Love\" and \"Every Day When I Get Home\".
