Originally a member of a group called the House Band, he recorded a solo rock album in 1983 on Atlantic Records before he began his country music career in 1989 on [[MCA Records]], recording two albums for that label. He later penned singles for [[Diamond Rio]] and [[Dwight Yoakam]], before finding another record deal on [[Epic Records]] in 1994. That year, he charted two Top 40 singles on the ''Billboard'' country chart, including the Top 10 hit \"[[This Is Me Missing You]]\".\n\n==Biography==\nJames House's musical career began in a band called the House Band, which was signed first to [[Warner Bros.
