I love how it speaks to the miracles that we’ve read of Jesus when he walked this earth,” Tomlin says. “Our faith is not a faith that’s just 30 minutes old, or the faith of just our parents, but it’s generations before us and generations after us. It’s a long line of those who’ve run the race.”\n\nThe album’s “Holy Forever” is the one that Tomlin considers the anchor of this anthology. “It’s a song that sounds like Heaven to me. It has this transcendence about it.” For him, worship music usually has two distinct lanes -- song of transcendence, and songs of deliverance and rescue. “This one takes you into the spiritual realm. It takes you into a place of worship where your spirit’s connecting to something eternal.” \n\nThis time around, his featured guests on Always include [[Elevation Worship]], [[Brandon Lake (musician)|Brandon Lake]], and [[Steffany Gretzinger]]. And because many hands make light work, Tomlin brought in a team of producers for Always, including [[Ben Glover]], Bryan Fowler, [[Ed Cash]], Jeff Sojka, Jonathan Smith and [[Lady A]]’s [[Dave Haywood]]. <ref>https://www.christomlin.com/blogs/news/new-music-holy-forever-off-new-worship-project</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ ''Always'' (2022) Track List\n|-\n!
