He had a [[Chart-topper|No.&nbsp;1 hit]] on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] with \"[[Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polkadot Bikini]]\" in 1960.  Other hits include \"[[Sealed with a Kiss]]\" and \"[[Gypsy Woman (The Impressions song)|Gypsy Woman]]\", which both reached No.&nbsp;3.  Hyland continued recording into the 1970s.

Hyland played the [[harmonica]] on a few numbers.\n\nHyland attempted several departures from the norm, including the [[psychedelic music|psychedelic]] single \"Get the Message\" (No.&nbsp;91 on the U.S. pop chart) and \"Holiday for Clowns\" (No.&nbsp;94),<ref name=\"Awards\"/> but despite their more contemporary arrangements, they failed to receive much [[airplay (radio)|airplay]].
