The band, Raymond Matthews (born October 13, 1956), Woody Wright (born October 10, 1957) and Tony King (born June 27, 1957), was put together by [[Columbia Records]] producer Larry Strickland after [[Shenandoah (band)|Shenandoah]] left the label, as an attempt to keep a viable country band on that label. Wright had previously been in another band called Memphis.\n\nThough they enjoyed video success on [[Country Music Television|CMT]] and [[The Nashville Network|TNN]] as well as touring with [[Reba McEntire]] for two seasons, their highest charting radio single, \"The Power of Love,\" peaked at No. 41 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs|Hot Country Singles & Tracks]] chart in 1992. It was the title track of their debut album, issued that same year on [[Columbia Records]]. The trio dissolved shortly after the release of their second album, ''Dream Seekers''.\n\nSince disbanding, Tony King joined [[Brooks & Dunn]]'s backing band and was also briefly engaged to [[Wynonna Judd]], Woody Wright found success as a [[gospel music|gospel]] songwriter, producer and solo artist, while Raymond Matthews returned to his native Alabama and a successful contracting business.\n\nIn 2013, Raymond Matthews and his daughter, Ashley Matthews Mobley, released an album entitled ''Come Home''.  The album is a compilation of gospel songs written by Raymond. Production and recording took place at Dugger Mountain Music Hall near Heflin, Alabama.\n\n==Discography==\n\n===''Power of Love''===\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Power of Love\n| type       = Studio\n| artist     = Matthews, Wright & King\n| cover      = Matthews,_Wright_&_King_-_Power_of_Love_Cover.jpg\n| alt        =\n| released   = {{start date|1992|5|5}}\n| recorded   = \n| venue      =\n| studio     = The Doghouse & Nightingale\n| genre      = Country\n| length     = 30:41\n| label      = Columbia Records\n| producer   = {{hlist|Steve Buckingham|Larry Strickland}}\n| prev_title = \n| prev_year  = \n| next_title = Dream Seekers\n| next_year  = 1993\n}}\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1      = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|4|5}} <ref Name=AM1>{{AllMusic|class=album|id=mw0000075926 |label=''Power of Love'' Review |first=Jason |last=Ankeny |accessdate=2 May 2021 }}</ref>\n}}\n{{tracklisting\n| total_length      = 30:41\n| title1            = The Power of Love\n| writer1           = [[Walt Aldridge]]\n| length1           = 2:50\n| title2            = For a Moment There\n| writer2           = {{hlist|Mike McGuire|Billy Henderson|Billy Maddox}}\n| length2           = 3:15\n| title3            = You Found a Way\n| writer3           = {{hlist|[[Gary Burr]]|[[Harry Stinson (musician)|Harry Stinson]]}}\n| length3           = 2:31\n| title4            = Someone's Child\n| writer4           = {{hlist|Billy Troy|Lee Bach}}\n| length4           = 3:07\n| title5            = Standing in the River (Dying of Thirst)\n| writer5           = {{hlist|[[Russell Smith (singer)|Russell Smith]]|[[John Jarrard]]}}\n| length5           = 3:17\n| title6            = Mother's Eyes\n| writer6           = {{hlist|[[Karen Staley]]|[[Gary Harrison]]}}\n| length6           = 3:27\n| title7            = When the River Runs High\n| writer7           = {{hlist|[[Robert Ellis Orrall]]|Charles Quillen}}\n| length7           = 2:27\n| title8            = Leavin' Reasons\n| writer8           = {{hlist|[[Craig Wiseman]]|[[Kent Robbins]]}}\n| length8           = 3:18\n| title9            = House Huntin'\n| writer9           = {{hlist|[[Bob DiPiero]]|[[Mark D.
