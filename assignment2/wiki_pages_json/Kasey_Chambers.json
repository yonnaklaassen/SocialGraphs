From 1992 Dead Ringer Band released an extended play and four albums.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"AMG\"/> For their first album, ''Red Desert Sky'' (November 1993), she was named as Kasey Jo Chambers, provided vocals and wrote four of its tracks.<ref name=\"NLA Red\"/><ref name=\"AMG RedDesert\"/> It was co-produced by the group with Eddie Sikorski at John Reynolds Recording Studio, [[Adelaide]].<ref name=\"NLA Red\"/><ref name=\"AMG RedDesert\"/>\n\nChambers met fellow country singer-songwriter [[Beccy Cole]] in mid-1989 in Adelaide, and she joined Dead Ringer Band on a tour through New South Wales before going solo.<ref name=\"AusStory Jul12\"/> Chambers later recalled, \"I never really met anyone at this point in my life that was of the same generation as me – a young girl who liked country music. And funnily enough the first song that I ever wrote in my life was called 'Beccy', about Beccy. It's the worst song you've ever heard in your whole life.\"<ref name=\"AusStory Jul12\"/> She cited [[Emmylou Harris]] as one of her primary influences, recalling that her parents had frequently Harris' music throughout her childhood.<ref name=\"Ryan\"/> The group ended when Chambers' parents divorced in the late 1990s, Diane moved to [[Norfolk Island]], and Bill moved to Sydney.<ref name=\"AMG\"/><ref name=\"Age Oct02\"/>\n\n==Solo career==\n===1998–2002: ''The Captain'' to ''Barricades & Brickwalls''===\nChambers recorded her debut solo album, ''[[The Captain (album)|The Captain]]'', on Norfolk Island during July and August 1998 with her brother Nash producing and father Bill on guitar.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Nimmervoll\"/> United States country musicians, [[Buddy Miller|Buddy]] and [[Julie Miller]] added guitars and vocals to four tracks. ''The Captain'' was released in May 1999 via [[EMI Music Australia]] and in June 2000 in the US by [[Asylum Records]]. It peaked at No.&nbsp;11 on the [[ARIA Charts|ARIA Albums Chart]] and No.&nbsp;1 on the related ARIA Country Albums chart.<ref name=\"AUS\"/> At the [[ARIA Music Awards of 1999]] she won [[ARIA Award for Best Country Album|Best Country Album]] and in the [[ARIA Music Awards of 2000|following year]] she won [[ARIA Award for Best Female Artist|Best Female Artist]] for its [[The Captain (Kasey Chambers song)|title track]], which was issued in 2000.<ref name=\"ARIA list\"/>\n\n''The Captain'' was certified double platinum for shipment of 140,000 copies by [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] (ARIA) in 2001.<ref name=\"ARIA Cert01 Albs\"/> It reached the top&nbsp;50 of the ''Billboard'' Top Country Albums in 2001.<ref name=\"Billb CountryA\"/> She toured the US as a support act to [[Lucinda Williams]] and later supported Emmylou Harris on the Australian leg of that artist's tour. \"The Captain\" was played in episode 8 (\"[[He Is Risen (The Sopranos)|He Is Risen]]\") of the third season of ''[[The Sopranos (season 3)|The Sopranos]]'', in April 2001.\n\nChambers' second studio album, ''[[Barricades & Brickwalls]]'', was released in September 2001 via EMI Music, which was also produced by Nash.<ref name=\"NLA Barricades\"/> It debuted at No.&nbsp;4 in the ARIA Albums Chart and peaked at No.&nbsp;1 in February of the following year.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"AUS\"/> Its third single, \"[[Not Pretty Enough]]\" (January 2002), also peaked at No.&nbsp;1 on the related ARIA Singles Chart in the same month.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"AUS\"/> The track was written by Chambers and according to Australian musicologist, [[Ian McFarlane]], \"[it's] about being ignored by commercial radio.\"<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/> He cited her autobiography, ''A Little Bird Told Me'' (2011), \"'I wrote [it] as a song about feeling invisible... it was obvious that out in the music industry there was only one path for most young women – over-sexualised and over made up. To succeed you needed to look like Britney or Shakira.\"<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/>\n\nShe is the first Australian country music artist to have simultaneous No.&nbsp;1 single and album. Subsequent singles \"[[Million Tears]]\" (June 2002) and \"[[If I Were You (Kasey Chambers song)|If I Were You]]\" (October) also made the top&nbsp;40.<ref name=\"AUS\"/> At the [[ARIA Music Awards of 2002]] she won three categories, [[ARIA Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]], Best Female Artist and Best Country Album, for ''Barricades & Brickwalls''.<ref name=\"ARIA list\"/> It was certified seven times platinum in 2003 for shipment of at least 490,000 copies.<ref name=\"ARIA Creds03A\"/> In February 2002 it was released in the US, which peaked at No.&nbsp;104 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], topping the related Heatseeker Chart and reaching the top&nbsp;20 of their country music chart. It received \"generally favorable reviews\" according to aggregate site, [[Metacritic]], with a rating of 74% from 12 critics.<ref name=\"Metacritic\"/>\n\nAustralian music journalist [[Ed Nimmervoll]] compared it to her first album, \"The musical cast remains essentially the same as ''The Captain'' with the addition of a 'rock' component via drummer Peter Luscombe and rhythm guitarist Dave Steel, and a guest appearance from 'punkabilly' band the Living End. The album also features appearances from Paul Kelly and American country's Lucinda Williams.\"<ref name=\"Nimmervoll\"/> Nimmervoll cited Chambers' observation, \"The last album showed my life story. That was Introducing Kasey Chambers. This one's The Many Moods of Kasey Chambers.\"<ref name=\"Nimmervoll\"/>\n\n===2003–2007: ''Wayward Angel'' to ''Carnival''===\nChambers recorded a cover version of Cyndi Lauper's \"[[True Colors (Cyndi Lauper song)|True Colours]]\" (April 2003), which peaked at No.&nbsp;4 on the ARIA Singles Chart <ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"AUS\"/> and was used as the theme song for the [[Rugby Union World Cup|Rugby World Cup]] in that year.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/> Her rendition reached No.&nbsp;76 on the End of Year Top&nbsp;100 Singles for 2003,<ref name=\"EoY 03S\"/> and was certified as a gold record for shipment of 35,000.<ref name=\"ARIA Creds03S\"/> At the [[APRA Music Awards of 2003]] Chambers won three categories with \"Not Pretty Enough\" named as Song of the Year, Most Performed Australian Work and Most Performed Country Work.<ref name=\"APRA List\"/>\n[[File:Chambers, Canberra, Nov 2006.jpg|thumb|160px|Chambers at the Royal Theatre, Canberra, November 2006|alt=She is shown in upper-body shot and left profile.

But this also sounds like her most accomplished effort to date.\"<ref name=\"Deming 2\"/>\n\nSingles from the album include \"[[Hollywood (Kasey Chambers song)|Hollywood]]\" (August 2004), \"Pony\" (January 2005), and \"Saturated\" (May).<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/> Following the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|Boxing Day Tsunami]] (26 December 2004), Chambers appeared at the [[Wave Aid]] charity concert in Sydney in January 2005, to help raise funds for organisations in disaster affected areas.<ref name=\"NME Wave\"/> At the [[ARIA Music Awards of 2004]] she won both Best Female Artist and Best Country Album for ''Wayward Angel''.<ref name=\"ARIA list\"/>\n\nChambers's fourth studio album, ''[[Carnival (Kasey Chambers album)|Carnival]]'' (August 2006), also debuted at No.&nbsp;1.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"AUS\"/> Deming found, \"[it] is roots-friendly enough that it isn't likely to seriously alienate most of her fans, this album does represent a clear and decisive break from the country-influenced approach of her earlier music; most of these 12 songs are easygoing but satisfying roots rock with a bluesy undertone... As a songwriter, she keeps getting better at writing about the stuff of everyday lives (love, lust, disappointment, getting on with life) with an uncommon degree of horse sense and attention to detail, and if anything, the new musical backdrops have added to the depth of her emotional landscapes.\"<ref name=\"Deming 3\"/> Its lead single, \"[[Nothing at All (Kasey Chambers song)|Nothing at All]]\" (July), reached the top&nbsp;ten.<ref name=\"AUS\"/>\n\n===2008–2010: ''Rattlin' Bones'' to ''Little Bird''===\n[[File:Kasey Chambers.jpg|Chambers at the ARIA Hall of Fame, July 2008|thumb|160px|alt=The 32-year-old Chambers wears a white dress with bare shoulders.

They have it down, from the sparing use of mandolin and the at times Everly Brothers harmonies to the dirt-beneath-the-fingernails aura. This music is American. Except that it's Australian. It's a conundrum.\"<ref name=\"Gutch\"/>\n\nChambers and Nicholson were joined by fellow country musician, [[Troy Cassar-Daley]], to perform at [[Sound Relief]], in March 2009, which was a benefit concert in support of survivors of the [[February 2009 Victorian bushfires]].<ref name=\"Brumby\"/><ref name=\"Mitchell\"/> It was held at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]], simultaneously with another concert at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]].<ref name=\"Brumby\"/> All the proceeds from the Melbourne concert went to the [[Red Cross]] Victorian Bushfire relief.<ref name=\"Brumby\"/><ref name=\"Mitchell\"/> Appearing with Chambers in Melbourne were [[Augie March]], Bliss N Eso with Paris Wells, [[Gabriella Cilmi]], [[Hunters & Collectors]], [[Jack Johnson (musician)|Jack Johnson]], [[Jet (band)|Jet]], [[Kings of Leon]], [[Liam Finn]], [[Midnight Oil]], [[Paul Kelly (Australian musician)|Paul Kelly]], [[Split Enz]], and [[Wolfmother]].<ref name=\"Official\"/>\n\nDuring 2009 Chambers collaborated with Bill, Nash and family members to release a children's music album, ''[[Kasey Chambers, Poppa Bill and the Little Hillbillies]]'' (November 2009).<ref name=\"NLA Hillbillies\"/> In 2010 it won the [[Australian Independent Record Labels Association|Australian Independent Record (AIR) Award]] for Best Independent Country Album.<ref name=\"AutoRI-1\"/> As part of that project she also co-wrote a children's story, ''Little Kasey Chambers and the Lost Music'' (2009), with Bernadette Werchon.<ref name=\"NLA Little Kasey\"/>\n\nChambers' seventh studio album, ''[[Little Bird (Kasey Chambers album)|Little Bird]]'', appeared in September 2010 via [[Liberation Music]], which peaked at No.&nbsp;3.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"AUS\"/> ''[[Slant Magazine]]''{{'}}s Jonathan Keefe rated it as four-out-of-five stars and explained, \"[it] is a polished, studio-slick record of pop-country whose songs are catchy as all hell... It's the economy of [her] songwriting that has been the source of the comparisons between her work and that of [Lucinda] Williams, and Chambers's deep understanding of song structure allows her to create real emotional complexity from just a few turns of phrase.\"<ref name=\"Keefe\"/> It won Best Country Album at the ARIA Awards in [[ARIA Music Awards of 2011|2011]].<ref name=\"ARIA list\"/>\n\n===2011–2013: ''Storybook'' to ''Wreck & Ruin''===\n''[[Storybook (Kasey Chambers album)|Storybook]]'', Chambers next studio album, was released in September 2011 and consists of cover versions of other artists material, which peaked at No.&nbsp;21.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"AUS\"/> ''No Surf Music''{{'}}s Jason D Hamad described how, \"because of its very nature I can't say that this album breaks any new ground. Still, it does justice to Chambers' sometimes-eclectic influences and adds an additional layer of understanding for her fans.\"<ref name=\"Hamad\"/>\n\nHer single from the album, \"[[Luka (song)|Luka]]\" (2011), is a rendition of Susan Vega's original from 1987. Hamad discussed how, \"[she] strips away the 80's synth-pop, replacing it with more traditional instrumentation including a prominent, bouncing bass, but keeps the airy musical feel meant to contrast with the dark tone of the lyrics.\"<ref name=\"Hamad\"/> Her autobiography, ''A Little Bird Told Me...'', was co-authored with music journalist, Jeff Apter, and was issued later that year.<ref name=\"NLA Autobio\"/><ref name=\"Hente\"/>\n\nHer second collaboration with Nicholson, ''[[Wreck & Ruin]]'' (September 2012), reached No.&nbsp;6 and provided another ARIA Award for Best Country Album in the [[ARIA Music Awards of 2013|next year]].<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"AUS\"/><ref name=\"ARIA list\"/> Keefe found the album has, \"the married couple layering intricate vocal harmonies over some casual, mostly acoustic country-rock...
