During his career, LeDoux recorded 36 albums (many self-released), which have sold more than six million units in the United States as of January 2007. He was awarded two gold and one platinum album certifications from the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]], and was honored with the [[Academy of Country Music]] Cliffie Stone Pioneer Award. LeDoux is also the only person to participate and also perform at the [[Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early years===\nLeDoux was born in [[Biloxi, Mississippi]], on October 2, 1948. He was of [[French people|French]] descent on his father's side. His father was in the [[US Air Force]] and was stationed at Keesler Air Force Base at the time of his birth. The family moved often when he was a child, due to his father's Air Force career. He learned to ride horses while visiting his grandparents on their [[Wyoming]] farm.<ref name=\"cmt\"/> At age 13, LeDoux participated in his first rodeo, and before long was winning junior rodeo competitions.<ref name=\"huey\">{{cite web |last= Huey |first= Steve |title= Chris LeDoux |publisher= [[Allmusic]] |year= 2005 |url ={{BillboardURLbyName |artist=chris ledoux |bio=true}} |access-date= 2007-03-16}}</ref>\n\nLeDoux continued to compete in rodeo events and played football through his high-school years. When his family moved to [[Cheyenne, Wyoming]], he attended [[Cheyenne Central High School]].  After twice winning the Wyoming State Rodeo Championship bareback riding title during high school, LeDoux earned a rodeo scholarship to [[Casper College]] in [[Casper, Wyoming|Casper]]. During his junior year at [[Eastern New Mexico University]], LeDoux won the Intercollegiate National [[saddle bronc and bareback riding|bareback riding]] championship.<ref name=\"cmt\">{{cite web |title= Chris LeDoux Biography |publisher= [[Country Music Television]] |year= 2005 |url= http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/ledoux_chris/bio.jhtml |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20111107135707/http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/ledoux_chris/bio.jhtml |archive-date= November 7, 2011 |access-date= 2007-03-16 |url-status= dead}}</ref>\n\nLeDoux married Peggy Rhoads on January 4, 1972.

After recording his songs in a friend's basement, LeDoux \"began selling his tapes at rodeo events out of the back of his pickup truck\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Chris LeDoux - LeDoux Country - Discography |url=https://www.ledouxcountry.com/discography/ |website=www.ledouxcountry.com |access-date=April 11, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"huey\"/>\n\nIn 1976, LeDoux won the world bareback riding championship at the [[National Finals Rodeo]] in [[Oklahoma City]].<ref name=\"huey\"/> Winning the championship gave LeDoux more credibility with music audiences, as he now had proof that the cowboy songs he wrote were authentic.<ref name=\"coon\">{{cite web |last= Coon |first= Chuck |title= Chris LeDoux: Missing Chris |publisher= ChrisLedoux.com |year= 2005 |url =http://www.chrisledoux.com/bio3.htm |access-date= 2007-03-16 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070309150925/http://chrisledoux.com/bio3.htm |archive-date= March 9, 2007}}</ref> LeDoux continued competing for the next four years. He retired in 1980.<ref name=\"huey\"/>\n\n===Music career===\nWith his rodeo career at an end, LeDoux and his family settled on a ranch in [[Kaycee, Wyoming]]. LeDoux continued to write and record his songs, and began playing concerts.<ref name=\"huey\"/> His concerts were very popular, and often featured a [[mechanical bull]] (which he rode between songs) and fireworks.<ref name=\"coon\"/> By 1982, he had sold more than 250,000 copies of his albums, with little or no marketing.  By the end of the decade, he had self-released 22 albums.<ref name=\"huey\"/>\n\nDespite offers from various record labels, LeDoux refused to sign a recording contract, instead choosing to retain his independence and control over his work while enjoying his regional following.  In 1989, however, he shot to national prominence when he was mentioned in [[Garth Brooks]]' top-10 country hit \"[[Much Too Young (To Feel This Damn Old)]]\". Capitalizing on the sudden attention, LeDoux signed a contract with [[Capitol Records]] subsidiary Liberty Records and released his first national album, ''[[Western Underground]]'', in 1991. His follow-up album, ''[[Whatcha Gonna Do with a Cowboy]]'', was certified gold and reached the top 10. The [[Whatcha Gonna Do with a Cowboy (song)|title track]], a duet with Brooks, became LeDoux's first and only top-10 country single, reaching number seven in 1992.<ref name=\"huey\"/> In concert, he ended the song by saying, \"Thanks, Garth!\"\n\nFor the 35th annual Grammy Awards in 1992, the single track \"Whatcha Gonna Do with a Cowboy\" was nominated for Best Country Vocal Collaboration.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chris LeDoux |url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/chris-ledoux |website=grammy.com |access-date=24 August 2017 |date=14 May 2017}}</ref> LeDoux and Brooks also received nominations from the [[Academy of Country Music]] for Vocal Duo of the Year and from the TNN/Music City News Country Awards for Vocal Collaboration of the Year.\n\nFor the next decade, LeDoux continued to record for Liberty. He released six additional records, including ''[[One Road Man]]'', which made the country top 40 in 1998.<ref name=\"huey\"/> Toward the end of his career, LeDoux began recording material written by other artists, which he attributed to the challenge of composing new lyrics.<ref name=\"coon\"/> With his 2000 release, ''Cowboy,'' he returned to his roots, re-recording many of his earliest songwriting creations.<ref name=\"huey\"/>\n\nThe RIAA certified two gold and one platinum recordings for LeDoux. On February 22, 1993, the single \"Whatcha Gonna Do with a Cowboy\" went gold. On June 2, 1997, the album ''The Best of Chris LeDoux'' went gold. And on October 5, 2005, the album ''20 Greatest Hits'' went platinum.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gold & Platinum - Chris LeDoux |url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&se=chris+ledoux#search_section |website=RIAA |publisher=Recording Association of America}}</ref><ref name=\"remaster\" />\n\n===Illness and death===\nIn August 2000, LeDoux was diagnosed with [[primary sclerosing cholangitis]], which required him to receive a [[liver]] transplant. [[Garth Brooks]] volunteered to donate part of his liver, but it was incompatible. An alternative donor was located, and LeDoux received a transplant on October 7, 2000.<ref name=\"gardner\">{{cite web |last= Gardner |first= Tom |title= Chris LeDoux Back After Transplant |publisher= PlanetGarth.Com |date= June 20, 2001 |url =http://www.planetgarth.com/news/article.php?cid=00547 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924073947/http://www.planetgarth.com/news/article.php?cid=00547 |archive-date=September 24, 2015 |access-date= March 16, 2007}}</ref> After his recovery, he released two additional albums. In November 2004, LeDoux was diagnosed with [[cholangiocarcinoma]], for which he underwent radiation treatment until his death.<ref name=\"huey\"/>\n\nLeDoux died of cancer on March 9, 2005, at age 56. His funeral was held on March 11.\n[[File:Chris Ledoux Monument.jpg|thumb|\"Good Ride Cowboy\" Sculpture in Kaycee, Wyoming.]]\n\n==Tributes==\nShortly after his death, LeDoux was named as one of six former rodeo cowboys to be inducted into the [[ProRodeo Hall of Fame]] in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]], in 2005.

A good friend.\"\n\nGarth Brooks performed the song on the ''39th Annual CMA Awards'' on November 15, 2005, live from Times Square in New York City.  Later that evening, LeDoux was honored with the CMA Chairman's Award of Merit, presented by [[Kix Brooks]] of [[Brooks & Dunn]], to LeDoux's family.\n\nFriends have also collaborated to produce an annual rodeo, art show, and concert in Casper, Wyoming to honor LeDoux's memory.
