Judd'''. Known primarily for his parodies of popular country songs, he has been called the [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]] of country music, and his albums are usually an equal mix of original comedy songs and parodies. Judd has released 11 studio albums and two EPs, and several singles have entered the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts. His chart peak is the number-48 \"I Love NASCAR\", a parody of [[Toby Keith]]'s 2003 single \"[[I Love This Bar]]\".\n\n==Musical career==\nJudd moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], to pursue a career in country music. By 1993, he was living in a house with [[Daron Norwood]] and preparing to move back home until he wrote a parody of \"[[Indian Outlaw]]\" by [[Tim McGraw]], which made him decide to pursue a career as a parodist.<ref name=\"stark\">{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/legal-and-management/6443453/cledus-t-judd-on-his-decision-to-bow-out-of-the-music|title=Cledus T.

Judd released his debut album, ''[[Cledus T. Judd (No Relation)]]'', on [[Razor & Tie Records]] in 1995, the \"(No Relation)\" part of the title being a reference to [[Wynonna Judd|Wynonna]] and [[Naomi Judd]].<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p144284/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Cledus T. Judd biography|last=Huey|first=Steve|work=[[Allmusic]]|access-date=January 9, 2009}}</ref> Two non-country parodies were also included on this album: one of the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]]' \"[[Hotel California]]\", and one of \"[[We Are the World]]\", a 1980s charity single credited to [[USA for Africa]]. Judd's parody, entitled \"We Own the World\", satirized the marriage of [[Lisa Marie Presley]] and [[Michael Jackson]].\n\n''[[I Stoled This Record]]'' followed in 1996. This album, despite not producing a chart single, earned [[RIAA]] gold certification for shipping 500,000 copies. This album included parodies of two [[Shania Twain]] songs: \"[[(If You're Not in It for Love) I'm Outta Here!]]\" became \"(I'm Not in Here for Love) Just a Beer\" and \"[[Any Man of Mine]]\" became \"If Shania Was Mine\". [[John Michael Montgomery]]'s \"[[Sold (The Grundy County Auction Incident)]]\" was also parodied twice on this album.\n\nHis third album, ''[[Did I Shave My Back for This?]]'' (a take-off on [[Deana Carter]]'s ''[[Did I Shave My Legs for This?]]''), included his first duet, with [[Buck Owens]] on the original track \"First Redneck on the Internet\". The album also parodied [[Alan Jackson]], [[Joe Diffie]], [[Brooks & Dunn]], [[Mindy McCready]], and [[Trace Adkins]].<ref name=\"allmusic\"/>\n\n1998's ''[[Juddmental]]'' was his final album for Razor & Tie. It included a duet, this time with [[Daryle Singletary]] on \"Ricky Tidwell's Momma's Gonna Play Football\", a non-parody song previously recorded by [[Tim Wilson (comedian)|Tim Wilson]]. This album once again parodied a Twain song, with her \"[[Honey, I'm Home]]\" becoming \"Shania, I'm Broke\". The [[Garth Brooks]]/[[Trisha Yearwood]] duet \"[[In Another's Eyes]]\" was also parodied on this compilation. It was originally to have been on Judd's previous album, but Brooks had initially expressed concern over a parody compromising the song's chances at winning a [[Grammy Award]].<ref name=\"countrymailbag.com\"/>\n\n===2000–2005===\nAfter leaving Razor & Tie Records, Judd signed to [[Monument Records]] Nashville in 2000 to release his fifth album, ''[[Just Another Day in Parodies]]''. This album produced his first chart single in \"My Cellmate Thinks I'm Sexy\", a parody of [[Kenny Chesney]]'s 1999 single \"[[She Thinks My Tractor's Sexy]]\" which referenced Chesney's and McGraw's 2000 arrest for stealing a Mounted Reserve officer's horse. The parody charted at No.&nbsp;61 on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now [[Hot Country Songs]]). Following this song was another chart single, \"How Do You Milk a Cow\" (based on [[Toby Keith]]'s \"[[How Do You Like Me Now?! (song)|How Do You Like Me Now?!]]\"), which peaked at No.&nbsp;67; the music video also features Toby Keith. In 2002, he released ''[[Cledus Envy]]'', followed later that year by a Christmas album entitled ''[[Cledus Navidad]]''. At the end of the year, Judd also made an appearance in the music video for Keith's \"[[Who's Your Daddy? (Toby Keith song)|Who's Your Daddy?]]\".\n\nHis last release for Monument was a six-song [[extended play|EP]] called ''[[A Six Pack of Judd]]'', released in 2003. After Monument closed its Nashville division, he signed to [[Koch Records]] Nashville to release a second EP, the four-song ''[[The Original Dixie Hick]]'', later in 2003. This release, which contained parodies pertaining to the [[Dixie Chicks]], also produced his third chart single in \"Martie, Natalie and Emily (The Continuing Saga Of)\", a parody of [[Brad Paisley]]'s \"[[Celebrity (Brad Paisley song)|Celebrity]]\".\n\nJudd's final release for Koch was 2004's ''[[Bipolar and Proud]]''. This album produced two more chart singles for him, including his highest-peaking, the No.&nbsp;48 \"I Love NASCAR\", which parodied Keith's \"[[I Love This Bar]]\" and included guest vocals from Keith himself. Following this song was the No.&nbsp;58 \"Bake Me A Country Ham\", based on [[Tracy Lawrence]]'s \"[[Paint Me a Birmingham]]\".\n\n===2006–2014 ===\nBy mid-2005, Judd had announced plans to release a tribute album to [[Ray Stevens]] entitled ''[[Boogity, Boogity - A Tribute to the Comedic Genius of Ray Stevens]]'', containing [[cover song|covers]] of Stevens's material with several guest vocalists. Due to the closure of Koch's Nashville division, however, this album was delayed until 2007, when Judd signed to [[Asylum-Curb Records]] and released it in August. Shortly before its release, he made his sixth chart appearance with the non-album song \"Illegals\".\n\nJudd re-signed to Koch in 2009, after the label was renamed E1 Music. In January of that year, he released the single \"Waitin' on Obama\" (a parody of Brad Paisley's \"[[Waitin' on a Woman]]\") referencing [[Barack Obama]]'s election as President of the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.cmt.com/2009-01-08/cledus-t-judd-counts-the-days-waitin-on-obama/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116111904/http://blog.cmt.com/2009-01-08/cledus-t-judd-counts-the-days-waitin-on-obama/|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 16, 2009|title=Cledus T.
