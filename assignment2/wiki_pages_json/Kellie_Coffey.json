From the first song to the last you are left wanting more. Kellie co-wrote eleven of the twelve songs on this album, and they are all truly unique. Every song sounded like it came straight from her heart, which made the album that much more enjoyable.\"\n\nThe following year, Coffey did a campaign with the Susan G. Komen Foundation in the production of the video for the title track of her independent album, \"Walk On\".  The video features documentary footage of participants in breast cancer walks.\n\nIn 2010 Coffey was the subject of the feature documentary film, \"Kellie Coffey: I'm Still Here\".
