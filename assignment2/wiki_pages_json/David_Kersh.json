The album also featured \"[[I Breathe In, I Breathe Out]]\", co-written by [[Chris Cagle]]; although Kersh's version of the song was never issued as a single, Cagle would later cut the song himself and take it to Number One on the country music charts in early 2002. \"If I Never Stop Loving You\" was followed by a No.&nbsp;29-peaking cover of [[Eric Clapton]]'s \"[[Wonderful Tonight]]\", and the No.&nbsp;46 \"Something to Think About\".\n\nIn 1999, Kersh received a nomination by the [[Academy of Country Music Awards]] for [[Academy of Country Music Award for New Male Artist of the Year|Top New Male Vocalist of the Year]], alongside [[Deryl Dodd]] and [[Mark Wills]], losing to Wills.
