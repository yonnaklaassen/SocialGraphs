He was a cousin of songwriter [[John D. Loudermilk]].\n\n==Biography==\nIra Louvin was born in [[Section, Alabama]], and played together with his brother, [[Charlie Louvin|Charlie]], in the [[close harmony]] tradition as [[the Louvin Brothers]]. They were heavily influenced by [[the Delmore Brothers]] and Monroe Brothers. Ira played mandolin with [[Charlie Monroe]], guitar player of the Monroe Brothers in the early 1940s. The Louvin Brothers' songs were heavily influenced by their Baptist faith and warned against sin.\n\nIra was notorious for his drinking and short temper.
