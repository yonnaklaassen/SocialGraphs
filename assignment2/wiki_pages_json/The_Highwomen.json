At the same time, the lack of representation of women artists on country music radio and at country music festivals had been publicly discussed by many, influenced by the [[MeToo movement]] and journalists like Marissa Moss. While on tour in her van, listening to country radio, Shires kept a running list of artists and noticed that there were few women. When she called to request they play more women artists, she was directed to a Facebook page lottery system. Cobb recommended Shires call Carlile, whom she didn't know. Carlile thought it would be fun, and would be an interesting creative project.<ref name=RollingStone-SiriusXM-2019 />\n\nThe Highwomen project was widely hinted at by Carlile, Morris and Shires before it was officially announced on April 6, 2019. With the name paying homage to The Highwaymen, the Highwomen were originally intended to leave the fourth spot in their line-up vacant to allow other female collaborators to join them, with [[Chely Wright]], [[Courtney Marie Andrews]], [[Margo Price]], [[Janelle Monáe]] and [[Sheryl Crow]] mentioned as potential guests.<ref name=Variety-MarenMorris-JoinsGroup-2019>{{cite news|first1=Chris|last1=Willman|title=Brandi Carlile, Amanda Shires Add Maren Morris to 'Highwomen' Supergroup|url=https://variety.com/2019/music/news/brandi-carline-maren-morris-amanda-shires-highwomen-supergroup-1203156171/|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=6 March 2019|access-date=19 July 2019|archive-date=8 June 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190608235415/https://variety.com/2019/music/news/brandi-carline-maren-morris-amanda-shires-highwomen-supergroup-1203156171/|url-status=live}}</ref> The band, who jokingly refer to the collaboration as a pirate ship experience, said that they see the project as an incubator project that highlights mentorship and support of fellow women artists.<ref name=RollingStone-SiriusXM-2019 />\n\nMorris hadn't worked with Cobb before, and remarked on how much she liked tracking live. The band recorded live vocals, live band, harmonies in unison, where the musicians were recording together live in an organic environment at historic [[RCA Studio A]], which Cobb now owns.<ref name=RollingStone-SiriusXM-2019 /> As part of the experience, some of the members got matching Highwomen tattoos.<ref name=NoDepression-InsideMakingOf-2019>{{cite news|last1=McCartney|first1=Kelly|title=Inside the Making and the Movement of The Highwomen|url=https://www.nodepression.com/inside-the-making-and-the-movement-of-the-highwomen/|work=[[No Depression (magazine)|No Depression]]|date=9 September 2019|access-date=7 September 2019|archive-date=9 September 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190909060846/https://www.nodepression.com/inside-the-making-and-the-movement-of-the-highwomen/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe group made their live debut on April 1, 2019 at [[Loretta Lynn]]'s 87th birthday concert held at the [[Bridgestone Arena]] in [[Nashville]].
