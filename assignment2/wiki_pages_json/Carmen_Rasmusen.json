She is a member of [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]. The second of four children, Rasmusen has been performing in public since the age of five: singing, dancing (including cheerleading, tap, ballet and hip-hop dance), and playing the piano.\n\nShe graduated from Woods Cross High School in Northern Utah in 2003,<ref name=\"imdb\" /> and is an alumna of [[Brigham Young University]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newsnet.byu.edu/story.cfm/64097 |title=Former 'Idol' Releases First Album |publisher=BYU NewsNet |accessdate=2008-05-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090209221412/http://newsnet.byu.edu/story.cfm/64097 |archivedate=February 9, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n==''American Idol''==\nRasmusen auditioned initially in Los Angeles and was put through to Hollywood.  She was originally eliminated by the judges during the Top 100 stage.  In a surprise move, Rasmusen and three other young female singers were brought back to compete in the Wild Card show.  No clear reason was made public, but speculation at the time centered on the show's producers wanting to provide a greater demographic diversity in the Final 12.\n\nRasmusen performed \"[[Can't Fight the Moonlight]]\" by [[LeAnn Rimes]] for her Wild Card performance.  Although the judges, including [[Simon Cowell]], opined that it was not a good enough performance to advance, the next night Cowell chose her as his \"judge's choice\" to move into the Top 12.  Carmen survived for seven weeks in the finals, earning generally mixed reviews from the judges throughout her stay.  Her performances of \"[[You Can't Hurry Love]]\" and \"[[Turn the Beat Around]]\" received relatively high marks from both judges and viewers, while her rendition of [[Blondie (band)|Blondie's]] \"[[Call Me (Blondie song)|Call Me]]\" during Billboard Number One Hits Night drew brickbats.  Judge [[Randy Jackson]] was often one of her harshest critics.\n\nRasmusen was praised by her fans as having a wholesome, girlish appeal and for refusing to wear outfits she thought were inappropriate for her.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}  Fans also cited her on-stage energy and strong [[vocal projection]].  Detractors pointed to her recurring difficulty in controlling her natural [[vibrato]] and her tendency to [[yodeling|yodel]] when changing registers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sonicswap.com/ep/search?query=Carmen+Rasmusen&search=music|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927104652/http://www.sonicswap.com/ep/search?query=Carmen+Rasmusen&search=music|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 27, 2007|title=by Carmen Rasmusen|date=September 27, 2007}}</ref> She was also one of the most outspoken defenders of the show among the second season finalists in the wake of the [[scandal]] involving [[Corey Clark]]'s allegations regarding [[Paula Abdul]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.realitytvworld.com/news/american-idol-2-finalist-carmen-rasmusen-defends-paula-abdul-1003181.php | title='American Idol 2' finalist Carmen Rasmusen defends Paula Abdul | work=Reality TV World | date=May 3, 2005 | accessdate=October 11, 2013}}</ref>\n\nAs the only contestant in the second season under the age of eighteen, she had to spend three hours a day with an on-set tutor.
