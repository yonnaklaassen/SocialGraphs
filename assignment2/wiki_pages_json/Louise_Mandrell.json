She is the younger sister of fellow country singer [[Barbara Mandrell]], and older sister of actress [[Irlene Mandrell]]. Louise had a successful singing career in [[country music]] from the 1970s, with a string of hits during the 1980s.\n\n==Early life==\nThelma Louise Mandrell was born in 1954,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://wtop.com/media-galleries/2016/07/celebrity-birthdays-week-july-10-16/slide/1/|title=Celebrity birthdays for the week of July 10–16|date=July 10, 2016|publisher=WTOP|access-date=September 26, 2017}}</ref> to Mary Ellen ([[Birth name#Maiden and married names|née]] McGill; born 1931) and Irby Matthew Mandrell (October 11, 1924 – March 5, 2009) in [[Corpus Christi, Texas]], United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0541876/bio|title=Louise Mandrell|publisher=IMDb|access-date=September 26, 2017}}</ref> She is the second of three daughters. Sister [[Barbara Mandrell|Barbara]] is five and a half years older; sister [[Irlene Mandrell|Irlene]] is one and a half years younger. Her mother, Mary, was a homemaker and musician hailing from rural [[Wayne County, Illinois|Wayne County]], Illinois. Her father Irby was a [[World War II]] naval veteran and [[Texas]] police officer from [[Garland County, Arkansas|Garland County]], Arkansas. Irby Mandrell was an accomplished musician and entrepreneur as well. He used his impeccable social skills and knowledge of the music industry to manage all three of his daughters' careers for over three decades.\n\nAlthough Louise Mandrell never developed the scale of fan base or the worldwide recognition that her older sister [[Barbara Mandrell|Barbara]] gained in [[country music]], she is still credited as one of country music's more successful female vocalists of the 1980s. With their parents coming from a musical background, Barbara started off working as a singer, and playing the [[steel guitar]] and other instruments, and toured with [[Patsy Cline]] in the early 1960s.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/1683428/the-first-families-of-country-music/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630064602/http://www.cmt.com/news/1683428/the-first-families-of-country-music/|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 30, 2015|title=The First Families of Country Music|work=CMT News|access-date=September 26, 2017}}</ref> Mandrell learned to play the guitar and bass. Soon, their parents founded the Mandrell Family Band, which toured the United States and Asia.\n\nBarbara's professional recognition in [[country music]] in the early 1970s with hits like \"[[Tonight My Baby's Coming Home]]\" and \"[[The Midnight Oil]]\" gave Louise opportunities at success.  She started performing in Barbara's band The DoRites in 1969.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Country Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1993|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-726-6|page=259}}</ref> Her first time in the studio was on the recording \"[[Always Wanting You]]\", a no. 1 hit for country singer-songwriter and [[Bakersfield sound]] pioneer [[Merle Haggard]] in 1975.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} In 1978, she signed with [[Epic Records]].<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/>\n\n==Music career==\nMandrell released her first single in 1978, called \"Put It On Me\", which appeared in the lower reaches of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine’s country music singles chart.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> In 1979, she released her next single, a cover version of \"[[Everlasting Love]]\", another minor country hit.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> She started singing duets with her husband R.C. Bannon, such as \"I Thought You'd Never Ask,\" which entered the top 50, and a cover of the pop/R&B number 1 song by [[Peaches & Herb]], \"[[Reunited (song)|Reunited]]\", which went to number 13, her first significant hit.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> In 1980, following two more solo efforts that did not see the same success, she joined sisters Barbara and [[Irlene Mandrell|Irlene]] on the TV variety show ''[[Barbara Mandrell and the Mandrell Sisters]]''.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> This show showcased not only her singing, but her multi-instrumental and comedy talents as well. In 1981, she signed with [[RCA Records]]. In 1982, Mandrell had two top 40 hits, as well as the top 20 hit \"Some of My Best Friends Are Old Songs\".\n\n1983 turned out to be her most successful year.  She entered the top 15 with \"Runaway Heart,\" and had the two top 10 hits \"[[Save Me (Clodagh Rodgers song)|Save Me]]\" (originally recorded by Northern Irish singer [[Clodagh Rodgers]]) and \"[[Too Hot to Sleep (song)|Too Hot to Sleep]]\".<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> In 1984, Mandrell had two other Top 40 hits, \"Goodbye Heartache\" and \"[[I'm Not Through Loving You Yet (Louise Mandrell song)|I'm Not Through Loving You Yet]]\" (co-written by [[Holly Dunn]]), and in 1985 the song \"[[I Wanna Say Yes]]\" entered the top 5.\n\n[[File:Louise Mandrell at Jamboree.jpg|thumb|left|Louise Mandrell and [[James G. Howes]] a visiting National Council Representative from the [[West Central Florida Council]] at the [[1993 National Scout Jamboree]], [[Fort Walker|Fort A.P.

Her last charted single came in 1988 with a cover of the song \"As Long As We Got Each Other\", a duet with [[Eric Carmen]].<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> The latter was the theme song of the 1985-1992 television sitcom ''[[Growing Pains]]''.\n\nRCA and Mandrell parted ways in 1988. During the early 1990s, she released the videos and songs \"Jean Paul\" (written by R.C. Bannon) and \"Down Home Christmas\". Both songs are extremely hard to find, and “Jean Paul” appears in ''Anthology'', a 1998 compilation album containing many of her successful hits from the Epic and RCA years, which is ''also'' hard to find.\n\nMandrell was named the official 'Sweetheart of Tennessee.'\n\nShe was the unanimous choice of 50 Tennessee city managers -- the first time the city manager's association has so honored anyone. Mandrell accepted 50 inscribed crimson hearts from the managers and, in return, entertained them with a few tunes. She also was named 1981's 'Yellow Rose of Texas' by the Texas state legislature, another first.\n\n==Personal life==\nHer marriage to Ronald Shaw on July 1, 1971, ended in divorce in 1973.  She subsequently married Gary Lamar Buck of the country music group [[The Four Guys]] on July 23, 1975. They divorced in 1978.\n\nIn 1978, Mandrell met [[R.C. Bannon]].  They married on February 26, 1979. He co-wrote a few songs for Louise’s sister Barbara. \"One of a Kind Pair of Fools\" is a 1983 single written by Bannon and [[John Bettis]] and recorded by Barbara Mandrell.  \"Only One Love in My Life,\" also written by R.C. Bannon and John Bettis, was [[Ronnie Milsap]]'s 10th number 1.\n\nMandrell and Bannon adopted Nicole Mandrell Shipley in 1986.  The couple divorced in 1991 and she married, for a fourth time, to John Haywood on July 16, 1993.\n\nShe became a grandmother for the first time in 2013.\n\n==Theater and writing==\nAfter leaving RCA Records, Mandrell continued to perform.
