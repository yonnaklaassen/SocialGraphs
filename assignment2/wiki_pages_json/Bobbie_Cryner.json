The album was heralded by the first single and video, \"I Just Can't Stand To Be Unhappy,\" which was written by noted songwriter Hugh Prestwood and entered the country charts on October 14, 1995. It peaked at No.&nbsp;63 on the Hot Country Singles & Tracks. The second single and video, \"You'd Think He'd Know Me Better,\" entered the charts on March 2, 1996, and peaked at No.&nbsp;56. A third single and video, Cryner's autobiographical \"I Didn't Know My Own Strength,\" was released in late summer 1996. Cryner left MCA in 1997.\n\nCryner continued writing songs for other artists, including [[Trisha Yearwood]]'s \"[[Real Live Woman (song)|Real Live Woman]]\" (#16), [[Suzy Bogguss]]' \"Nobody Love, Nobody Gets Hurt\" (#63), and [[Lee Ann Womack]]'s \"Stronger Than I Am.\"\n\nBobbie Cryner appeared briefly in the 1995 film ''[[Something to Talk About (film)|Something to Talk About]]'' starring [[Julia Roberts]], [[Dennis Quaid]], and [[Robert Duvall]].\n\n==Discography==\n===Albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:12em;\"| Title\n! style=\"width:18em;\"| Album details\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[Bobbie Cryner (album)|Bobbie Cryner]]''\n|\n* Release date: August 24, 1993\n* Label: [[Epic Records]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[Girl of Your Dreams (Bobbie Cryner album)|Girl of Your Dreams]]''\n|\n* Release date: January 2, 1996\n* Label: [[Universal Music Group Nashville|MCA Nashville]]\n|}\n\n===Singles===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Year\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:18em;\"| Single\n! colspan=\"2\"| Peak chart<br />positions\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Album\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n! width=\"45\"| [[Hot Country Songs|US Country]]\n! width=\"45\"| [[RPM (magazine)|CAN Country]]\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 1993\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Daddy Laid the Blues on Me\"\n| 63\n| 72\n| align=\"left\" rowspan=\"3\"| ''Bobbie Cryner''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"He Feels Guilty\"\n| 68\n| 48\n|-\n| 1994\n! scope=\"row\"| \"You Could Steal Me\"\n| 72\n| —\n|-\n| 1995\n! scope=\"row\"| \"I Just Can't Stand to Be Unhappy\"\n| 63\n| 55\n| align=\"left\" rowspan=\"3\"| ''Girl of Your Dreams''\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 1996\n! scope=\"row\"| \"You'd Think He'd Know Me Better\"\n| 56\n| —\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"I Didn't Know My Own Strength\"\n| —\n| 90\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" style=\"font-size:8pt\"| \"—\" denotes releases that did not chart\n|-\n|}\n\n===Music videos===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n!
