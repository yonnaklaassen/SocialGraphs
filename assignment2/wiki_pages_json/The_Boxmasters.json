Andrew. The group released their 17th album ''Love & Hate In Desperate Places'' in August of 2024 and finished multiple other records, that are still waiting to see the light of day.\n\nBefore he formed the Boxmasters, frontman [[Billy Bob Thornton|Thornton]] had played in bands since middle school, worked as a [[roadie]], recorded in 1974 in Muscle Shoals, Alabama and in the 2000s released four solo albums. After listening to \"[[Yesterday's Gone (song)|Yesterday's Gone]]\" by [[Chad & Jeremy]] and thinking about [[cover (music)|covering]] it in a [[Old-time music|hillbilly music]] [[music style|style]], he had the idea of making Americanized version of [[British Invasion]] [[pop music|pop songs]]. From mid-2008 to late 2008, the group embarked on a tour across the United States, ending in [[Los Angeles]]. It also played for the March 2009 [[South by Southwest]] conference. After opening several tours for Willie Nelson in 2009 & 2010, The Boxmasters ceased touring for five years, which they used to write multiple albums and emerged with a more natural sound, as opposed to their early hillbilly leanings.\n\n==History==\n=== Beginnings ===\n[[Billy Bob Thornton]]—credited on the band's material as W. R. Thornton—has said that \"[he] never intended to become a movie star, it happened accidentally.

D. Andrew to help with his 2007 album ''[[Beautiful Door]]''. After [[Jam session|jamming]] together, they started to record some of their material. Andrew had known Mike Butler \"for six or seven years\" and called on him to play guitar for them. According to Andrew, after the trio played together, they said \"Shoot, this sounds like a band.\" The three came up with the name \"Boxmasters\" after a piece of [[Southern American English|Southern slang]], which they later described by saying \"remember the bad boy in high school who got all the girls and left a trail of broken hearts ... and more?\"<ref name=mod/> Thornton had also briefly played in [[country music|country]] star [[Porter Wagoner]]'s similarly titled band 'The Wagonmasters', which he later said had brought chills down his spine.<ref name=cross>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080908011946/http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1594027/billy-bob-thornton-crosses-musical-boundaries-with-boxmasters.jhtml Billy Bob Thornton Crosses Musical Boundaries With Boxmasters].
