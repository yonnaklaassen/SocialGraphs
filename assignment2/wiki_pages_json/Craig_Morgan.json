In 2002, Morgan signed to the independent [[Broken Bow Records]], on which he released three studio albums: 2003's ''[[I Love It (album)|I Love It]]'', 2005's ''[[My Kind of Livin']]'', and 2006's ''[[Little Bit of Life]]''. These produced several chart hits, including \"[[That's What I Love About Sunday]]\", which spent four weeks at the top of the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country charts while also holding the No.&nbsp;1 position on that year's [[Billboard Year-End|''Billboard'' Year-End]] chart for the country format. A [[Greatest Hits (Craig Morgan album)|greatest hits]] package followed in mid-2008 before Morgan signed to [[BNA Records]] and released ''[[That's Why (album)|That's Why]]'' later that same year. After exiting BNA, Morgan signed with [[Black River Entertainment]] and released ''[[This Ole Boy]]'' in 2012, followed by ''[[A Whole Lot More to Me]]'' in 2016.\n\nMorgan has charted seventeen times on the ''Billboard'' country charts.
