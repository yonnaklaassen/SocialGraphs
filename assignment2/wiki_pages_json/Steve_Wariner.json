Initially a backing musician for [[Dottie West]], he also worked with [[Bob Luman]] and [[Chet Atkins]] before beginning a solo career in the late 1970s. He has released eighteen studio albums and over fifty singles for several different record labels.\n\nWariner experienced his greatest chart successes in the 1980s, recording first for [[RCA Records Nashville]] and then [[Universal Music Group Nashville|MCA Nashville]]. While on these labels he sent a number of singles into the top ten of the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts and received favorable critical reception for the amount of creative control he held over his body of work. Upon moving to [[Arista Nashville]] in 1991 he had his most commercially successful album ''[[I Am Ready]]'', his first to be certified [[music recording sales certification|gold]], but followups were less successful. After a period of commercial downfall, he experienced a second wave of success in the late 1990s which was spurred by co-writing the number-one singles \"[[Longneck Bottle]]\" by [[Garth Brooks]] and \"[[Nothin' but the Taillights (song)|Nothin' but the Taillights]]\" by [[Clint Black]]. These songs led to him signing with [[Capitol Records]] Nashville and achieving two more gold albums with ''[[Burnin' the Roadhouse Down]]'' and ''[[Two Teardrops]]'' by decade's end. While his commercial success once again dwindled after these albums, he has continued to record independently on his own SelecTone label.\n\nTen of Wariner's singles have reached the number-one position on the Hot Country Songs charts: \"[[All Roads Lead to You]]\", \"[[Some Fools Never Learn]]\", \"[[You Can Dream of Me]]\", \"[[Life's Highway (song)|Life's Highway]]\", \"[[Small Town Girl (Steve Wariner song)|Small Town Girl]]\", \"[[The Weekend (Steve Wariner song)|The Weekend]]\", \"[[Lynda (Steve Wariner song)|Lynda]]\", \"[[Where Did I Go Wrong]]\", \"[[I Got Dreams (song)|I Got Dreams]]\", and \"[[What If I Said]]\" (a duet with [[Anita Cochran]]). Wariner holds several writing credits for both himself and other artists, and has collaborated with [[Nicolette Larson]], [[Glen Campbell]], [[Diamond Rio]], [[Brad Paisley]], [[Asleep at the Wheel]], and [[Mark O'Connor]] among others. He has also won four [[Grammy Award]]s: one for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals, and three for Best Country Instrumental. In addition to these he has won three [[Country Music Association]] awards and one [[Academy of Country Music]] award, and is a member of the [[Grand Ole Opry]]. Wariner's musical style is defined by his lead guitar work, lyrical content, and stylistic diversity.\n\n==Early life==\nSteven Noel Wariner was born on December 25, 1954, in [[Noblesville, Indiana]],<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> but grew up in [[Russell Springs, Kentucky]].<ref name=\"wizard\"/> As a teenager, Wariner taught himself how to play several instruments, including [[acoustic guitar]], [[bass guitar]], [[drum kit|drums]], [[banjo]], and [[steel guitar]].<ref name=\"hearts\">{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/112289973/ | title=Steve Wariner hits #1 spot in hearts of country artists | work=[[The Tennessean]] | date=September 28, 1982 | access-date=September 29, 2019 | author=[[Robert K.

Wariner co-wrote five songs on the album including \"You Can Dream of Me\", which he wrote with [[John Hall (New York politician)|John Hall]], then of the band [[Orleans (band)|Orleans]]. As with the previous album, Bowen and Brown requested that he have input on song selection and production processes; one such decision made by Wariner was not to have a [[string section]] on the album because he would not be able to include one in a live setting.<ref name=\"honesty\">{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/112427983/ | title=Steve Wariner's success built on honesty | work=The Tennessean | date=May 10, 1986 | access-date=October 6, 2019}}</ref> Al Campbell of AllMusic reviewed the album favorably, stating that it \"showed him moving into a more mature musical direction.
