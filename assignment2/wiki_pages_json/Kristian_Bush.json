Storyteller covered the Replacement's \"I Can't Wait”, Rod Stewart's \"Maggie May”, The English Beat's \"Mirror in the Bathroom\", and Jane's Addiction's \"Jane Says”, among other songs, and they performed at numerous bars, campus events and parties in Atlanta.\n\nTo date, Bush has won six [[BMI Awards]] for his songwriting abilities, and in 2011 he founded the music publishing company and songwriting collective Songs of the Architect.

In 1990, Bush played guitar and sang backup vocals on ''Big Back Porch Songs'', an album by the Hyras. ''Big Back Porch Songs'' was never released but Bush was given a copy.

The two released their first album together in 1991, ''St. Christopher's Crossing'', independently under the credit Andrew Hyra and Kristian Bush.<ref name=\"AMBP\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/billy-pilgrim-mn0000770092 |title=Billy Pilgrim - Biography |access-date=October 25, 2023 |website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref> They continued performing shows in southeastern college towns, and Bush reached out to various talent agents with their demos; Jen Stark, an intern at [[Atlantic Records]], recceived a copy, which resulted in commotion about them amongst the company. An indie label, Sister Ruby, expressed interest in the duo, and the two made another album for the label; it emphasized songs that weren't used for ''St. Christophers's Crossing'', which were quieter songs that couldn't be played in loud clubs.  The album was called ''Words Like Numbers''. Bush cited a large improvement between the two albums, because \"with ''St. Christopher's'' we didn't think, we just did it.  This time we had several weeks to think about what we were recording.\"<ref name=\"BP\"/> The album was a success in garnering attention; Atlantic Records held a release party for the two, and they were signed to the label that night,<ref name=\"BP\"/> in New York.<ref name=\"TED\"/> The duo name was officially changed to [[Billy Pilgrim (duo)|Billy Pilgrim]], named after a character from [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s novel ''[[Slaughterhouse-Five]]''.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Billy Pilgrim Review |url=https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/268642485.pdf |last=Cook |first=Sean |date=February 17, 1994 |pages=2 |work=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]}}</ref><ref name=\"BP\"/><ref name=\"TOCBP\"/>\n\nThe duo released the self-titled album ''Billy Pilgrim'' in 1994, in association with producer [[Hugh Padgham]], who had a group of London musicians overdub the master with additional instruments.<ref name=\"BP\"/><ref name=\"TOCBP\">{{Cite web |url=https://tasteofcountry.com/kristian-bush-pre-sugarland-band-billy-pilgrim-lost-album-time-machine/ |title=Kristian Bush's Pre-Sugarland Album Band Billy Pilgrim Releasing Their Long Lost Album [Listen] |date=July 16, 2020 |access-date=October 25, 2023 |website=[[Taste Of Country]] |last=Trapp |first=Phillip}}</ref> Although the album itself received little attention, \"Get Me Out Of Here\" and \"Insomniac\", two songs on the album were, receiving heavy airplay on AAA radio.

Hyra moved to California but still kept in contact with Bush. Billy Pilgrim went silent temporarily as did Bush; he occasionally played at [[Eddie's Attic]], and did production work [[Ellis Paul]], Beth Wood, and [[Evan and Jaron]]. Bush announced the two were making separate solo albums in 1997, but such albums never released. Bush and Hyra collaborated for a \"farewell\" tour, and although they simply meant they were taking a hiatus, news spread they were disbanding.<ref name=\"BP\"/>\n\n==== 1999–2001: Billy Pilgrim hiatus ====\nIn 1999, Bush took interest in the newly developing format of online music distribution. He began releasing demos, outtakes, and live performances from Billy Pilgrim on the website [[MP3.com]]. He appreciated that he was able to release music easily without anyone else's approval. Bush partnered with MP3.com to release an old live performance of Billy Pilgrim at Eddie's Attic in 1998, ''Live from Wildhack, MT'', on the website. The performance also contained unreleased songs. Billy Pilgrim released ''Snow Globe'', a Christmas album, in November 1999, and ''9/23/00'', another live performance from Eddie's Attic, released towards the end of the year.<ref name=\"BP\"/>\n\nAll the money earned from the downloads on MP3.com Bush used to fund the next album and its physical release. The album, ''Billy In the Time Machine'', was recorded in four separate sessions over the course of eight months. Bush cited [[U2]]{{'}}s ''[[The Joshua Tree]]'' and [[Thom Yorke]] as inspiration for the album. It was released May 12, 2001.<ref name=\"BP\"/> The final works the two made together before unofficially disbanding were compiled into masters tapes.

[[Byron Gallimore]], Sugarland's producer, ensured him that since he was never the primary singer of the band, he wouldn't replace Sugarland on country radio.
