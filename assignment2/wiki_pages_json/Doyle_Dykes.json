Some of his best-known works and interpretations are \"[[Wabash Cannonball]]\", \"Country Fried Pickin'\", \"U2 Medley\", \"Be Still\", \"[[Amazing Grace]]\" and \"[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]\". Dykes is a devout [[Christians|Christian]] and has served as a minister in a small church in Florida;<ref name=\"Dykes2011, p.75\">Dykes (2011), p.75</ref> the influence of Christianity is present in much of his work.

His father is referred to as \"Bubba Dykes\" and he has a brother named Aubrey.<ref name=\"Dykes2011, p.35\"/> He cites June 1965 during his church's \"summer revival\" as the moment he became a lifelong Christian as an 11-year-old boy, seeing \"the lights of salvation and a new purpose and desire for my life and since that day, I've never been the same\".<ref name=\"Dykes2011, p.35\">Dykes (2011), p.35</ref> His first guitar was a $30 Sears Roebuck Silvertone acoustic.<ref name=\"Dykes2011, p.32\">Dykes (2011), p.32</ref> Dykes claims a sailor named Barry Lackey was the most important influence in his development as a guitarist. Lackey attended his church one day, and using a thumbpick from his pocket, \"completely blew him away\" with his \"spider picking\", playing just like [[Chet Atkins]] and [[Merle Travis]], Doyle's heroes.<ref name=\"Dykes2011, p.45\">Dykes (2011), p.45-7</ref> Lackey was then invited to his home for supper that night and showed him a right-hand picking pattern that \"got his fingers working together in the right way, where the thumb played the bass and after-beat rhythm, and the three fingers took care of the rest.\"<ref name=\"Dykes2011, p.45\"/> He later reunited with Lackey at a Taylor Guitars event in [[Detroit]] in 2002, and said that were it not for him, he would never have become a successful guitarist.<ref name=\"Dykes2011, p.45\"/>\n\nDykes' early years as a guitarist took him around the world as he toured with [[J. D. Sumner|the Stamps Quartet]] and later with [[Grand Ole Opry]] star [[Grandpa Jones]]. Dykes has since returned to the Grand Ole Opry for numerous performances. Although a world-renowned guitarist, Dykes frequently plays church venues with small audiences, and some intimate shows that aren't advertised, stating, \"I've been blessed with the opportunity to play music for people.\"<ref name=\"NAMM\"/>\n[[File:Dykes and Emmanuel.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Performing with [[Tommy Emmanuel]] in the Netherlands, April 2006]]\nDykes was a longtime endorser of [[Taylor Guitars]]. According to owner [[Bob Taylor (luthier)|Bob Taylor]], \"If I had to pick the artist who most represented the Taylor Guitars brand and who has done the most for us, I would say Doyle Dykes.
