Tuftin is also a professional [[rodeo]] [[team roping]] competitor, having qualified for the [[National Finals Rodeo]] NFR once when competing on the [[Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association]] (PRCA) circuit. He also competed with multiple world champion team roper, and 2018 [[ProRodeo Hall of Fame]] inductee Speed Williams.\n\n== Career ==\nHis debut album \"Not So Little Anymore\" was released in 2002 via Stolen Horse Records and distributed to brick and mortar channels in Canada through two distribution deals, one with Sextant Records/EMI Music Canada and the other through Royalty Records. A chance meeting in Nashville between a songwriter and a music industry veteran led to the Tuftin camp enlisting the expertise of former Warner Music Canada label rep Greg Balec in attempts to make waves at country radio. A lead-off single was rushed to radio stations across Canada, producing a Top 20 hit out of the box. That debut single, \"Talk Is Cheap\" had music directors across the nation in a state of frenzy, desperately making calls to get their hands on the track. Tuftin followed that instant success with \"I'm Not So Little Anymore,\" which skyrocketed into the Top 10, then charted with singles \"You Can't\" and \"In Her Eyes.\" In 2005, the lead-off single \"Wide Open Highway\" from his forthcoming second album, reached the No. 1 spot on the ''[[Radio & Records]]'' Canadian country singles chart and was nominated for Independent Song of the Year at the 2005 [[Canadian Country Music Association]] awards,<ref>{{cite web |title=2005 Canadian Country Music Awards – Nominees |url=http://countrymusic.about.com/od/awards/a/blccmanom05_2.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304061951/http://countrymusic.about.com/od/awards/a/blccmanom05_2.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=March 4, 2016 |website=About Entertainment |access-date=July 20, 2019 |date=March 4, 2016}}</ref> however, the finished album featuring several potential chart toppers like the power ballad \"It's About Time\" and upbeat \"Grain of Salt\" among others, never saw commercial release. \"Wide Open Highway\" later appeared on store shelves on the Sony/BMG Canada various artists compilation CD Country Heat 2006 and also garnered a 2006 SOCAN Award for Canadian Country Song of the Year. A second single titled \"A Definite Maybe\" was released but failed to impact at Canadian radio, mainly due to the track's lack of Cancon content.  Tuftin also released two music videos, both of which hit the top ten on Country Music Television in Canada.<ref name=\"TeamRoping\">{{cite web |title=The Inside Scoop with Dean Tuftin |url=https://teamropingjournal.com/roping-tips/inside-scoop-dean-tuftin |website=The Team Roping Journal |date=April 2007 |access-date=September 9, 2018}}</ref>\n\nTuftin is also an accomplished team roper.

Dean hails from a rodeo family in Alberta: a barrel racing mother, a team roping father, and a bullfighting brother.
