The band consists of [[Raul Malo]] (lead vocals, bass guitar), Paul Deakin (drums), [[Eddie Perez (guitarist)|Eddie Perez]] (lead guitar), and Jerry Dale McFadden (keyboards). Malo and Deakin founded the band in 1989 along with Robert Reynolds (bass guitar) and Ben Peeler (lead guitar). After one independent album, the band was signed by [[MCA Nashville Records]] and [[David Lee Holt]] replaced Peeler on lead guitar; he would be replaced by Nick Kane shortly after their second MCA album and third overall 1994's ''[[What a Crying Shame]]''. The band recorded a total of four albums for MCA and one for [[Mercury Records]] before disbanding in 2000. They reunited for one album in 2003 on [[Sanctuary Records]], by which point Perez had become their fourth guitarist, and former touring keyboardist Jerry Dale McFadden became an official fifth member. The lineup of Malo, Deakin, Reynolds, Perez, and McFadden reunited a second time in 2012 for a series of new albums, first on [[Big Machine Records]]' Valory imprint and then on Mono Mundo. Reynolds was fired in 2014 and Ed Friedland served as touring bassist until 2023, with Malo taking the role of bassist soon afterward.\n\nThe Mavericks have charted 15 times on the American ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts; their highest-peaking single there is \"[[All You Ever Do Is Bring Me Down]]\", a collaboration with accordionist [[Flaco Jiménez]] which reached number 13 in 1996. Three of their singles made top 10 on the country music charts of the defunct ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' magazine in Canada, and \"[[Dance the Night Away (The Mavericks song)|Dance the Night Away]]\" was a hit single in the United Kingdom in 1998. Their most commercially successful album ''What a Crying Shame'' has been [[music recording certification|certified platinum]] in the United States and double-platinum in Canada. In addition, the band has received one [[Grammy Award]], two [[Country Music Association]] awards, and three [[Academy of Country Music]] awards. Their sound is defined by a wide variety of musical styles outside of country music, such as [[Tejano music|Tejano]], [[Music of Latin America|Latin]], [[Americana music|Americana]], and the [[pop music]] of the 1950s, with particular emphasis on Malo's singing voice.\n\n==History==\nThe Mavericks were founded in [[Miami]], Florida, in 1989.<ref name=\"eclectic\">{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/777817090/ | title=The Mavericks: Eclectic band still ready to buck all the labels and categories | work=[[The Knoxville News-Sentinel]] | date=April 8, 2016 | accessdate=February 3, 2022 | pages=20 | archive-date=June 17, 2024 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240617202958/https://www.newspapers.com/image/777817090/ | url-status=live }}</ref> Lead vocalist and guitarist [[Raul Malo]] met bass guitarist Robert Reynolds, a native of [[Kansas City, Missouri]],<ref name=\"move\"/> when both were performing in local bands.

In a review of ''From Hell to Paradise'', Alanna Nash described Malo's singing voice as \"a tight, pinched [[vibrato]] that carries all the tension of a high-voltage wire\".<ref name=\"nash hell\"/> Writing for AllMusic, John D. Buchanan described ''What a Crying Shame'' as \"a grand showcase for the rich, emotive vocals of Raul Malo and the band's eclectic but accessible approach.\"<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> In a review of ''Trampoline'' for the same site, Thom Owens stated that Malo's voice was the defining characteristic of the band's sound; he wrote that, through his singing and production, Malo was the \"driving force behind all of the group's stylistic fusions, their blend of honky tonk with country-rock, classic rock & roll, pop, and Latin.\"<ref name=\"owens trampoline\">{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/trampoline-mw0000009448 | title=''Trampoline'' review |  work=AllMusic | publisher=All Media Network  | accessdate=February 11, 2022 | author=Thom Owens | archive-date=June 17, 2024 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240617205158/https://www.allmusic.com/album/trampoline-mw0000009448 | url-status=live }}</ref> Of the songwriting, Owens continued that Malo was \"among the most imaginative [[Americana (music)|roots]] songwriting of the '90s.\"<ref name=\"owens trampoline\"/> [[Tony Brown (record producer)|Tony Brown]], a record producer who was also the head of [[artists and repertoire]] (A&R) of MCA Nashville at the time of the band's signing, described Malo as \"bigger than life\" in a way that he compared to [[Alabama (band)|Alabama]] lead singer [[Randy Owen]]; Brown also thought that having a \"great frontman\" was key to a country music band's success.<ref name=\"move\"/>\n\nMusic critics have defined the band's musical styles with a wide variety of influences. Brown thought that the success of new bands in the 1990s such as [[Diamond Rio]], combined with the commercial appeal of more rock-influenced country bands such as [[The Kentucky Headhunters]], would lead to The Mavericks' success.<ref name=\"move\"/> Nash wrote that they \"constitute country’s coolest ensemble, synthesizing ’50s country and ’60s pop and rock with intelligence, verve, and cultural variety.\"<ref name=\"occasions ew\"/> John D. Buchanan of AllMusic said of the band that \"Fusing traditional country with a rich variety of rock, pop, and Latin influences, the Mavericks became one of the most critically acclaimed and commercially successful groups of the early '90s.\"<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> Rick Bell of the ''North County Times'', in a review of ''Trampoline'', noted that the band's use of [[horn section]]s and [[string section]]s on the album gave it a \"fuller sound\" that complemented Malo's \"velvety baritone\".<ref name=\"rick bell\">{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/577370379/ | title=Review: The Mavericks, ''Trampoline'' | work=North County Times | date=May 8, 1998 | accessdate=February 11, 2022 | pages=23 | archive-date=February 15, 2022 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220215000019/https://www.newspapers.com/image/577370379/ | url-status=live }}</ref>  Mark Deming highlighted Nick Kane's \"fine [[hipster (1940s subculture)|hipster]] jazz picking\" in a review of ''Music for All Occasions''.
