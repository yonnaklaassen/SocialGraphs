His music career began in the 1980s as a member of the Tennessee River Boys, a predecessor to the country band [[Diamond Rio]]. Herndon quit the band early on and gained his first national exposure as a competitor on ''[[Star Search]]''. He then played at various [[honky-tonk]]s in [[Texas]]. After signing to [[Epic Records]] in 1993, Herndon made his debut in 1995 with his number-one single, \"[[What Mattered Most (song)|What Mattered Most]]\". This was followed that same year by the release of his first album, also titled ''[[What Mattered Most]]''.\n\nHerndon released three more studio albums and a compilation for Epic: ''[[Living in a Moment]]'' (1996), ''[[Big Hopes]]'' (1998), ''[[Steam (Ty Herndon album)|Steam]]'' (1999), and ''[[This Is Ty Herndon: Greatest Hits]]'' (2002). He recorded a Christmas album in 2002 before a recording hiatus. He returned with his fifth studio album, ''[[Right About Now (Ty Herndon album)|Right About Now]]'' (2007) for the Titan Pyramid label; his sixth studio release, ''Journey On'', followed in 2010. Herndon has charted a total of 17 singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts. This figure includes three number-ones: \"What Mattered Most\", \"[[Living in a Moment (song)|Living in a Moment]]\" and \"[[It Must Be Love (Ty Herndon song)|It Must Be Love]]\". His singles \"[[I Want My Goodbye Back]]\", \"[[Loved Too Much]]\", \"[[A Man Holdin' On (To a Woman Lettin' Go)]]\", and \"[[Hands of a Working Man]]\" all made top ten on the same chart.\n\nHerndon gained further media attention in 2014 after he [[coming out|came out]] as gay, becoming the first mainstream male country music singer to do so. His personal life has been the subject of mainstream media for other reasons, including his struggles with drug addiction and mental health. His musical style is defined by his singing voice and an emphasis on ballads.\n\n== Early life ==\nBoyd Tyrone Herndon was born on May 2, 1962, in [[Meridian, Mississippi]], to Boyd and Renee Herndon.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/><ref name=\"facts\">{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/322684326/ | title=Ty Herndon: the facts of life | work=The Tribune | date=August 19, 1997 | access-date=June 18, 2022 | pages=3}}</ref> He was raised just across the state line in [[Butler, Alabama]].<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p142392|pure_url=yes}} |title=Ty Herndon biography |access-date=May 15, 2008 |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |author-link=Stephen Thomas Erlewine |publisher=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref> His grandmother played guitar and hosted her own radio show in Butler.<ref name=\"facts\"/> He became involved in music in his youth.
