She was captivated by Broadway show tunes, the [[Beatles]], and the [[Motown]] sound, and has said that she was such an avid listener to Top 40 radio that \"I used to come home from school, have dinner, go to bed, and set the alarm for midnight. Then I'd get up and do my homework and listen to the radio. It was my favorite time – I could be alone with the music.\"<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.katymoffatt.com/bio.html|title=Katy Moffatt : Americana Musician|website=www.katymoffatt.com}}</ref>\n\n== Early influences ==\nMoffatt points to the influence of the Beatles and the bands of the [[British Invasion]] as inspiring her to learn the guitar. She credits [[Leonard Cohen]]'s \"Dress Rehearsal Rag\" for making her want to perform and says folk singers like [[Judy Collins]], [[Phil Ochs]], and [[Dave Van Ronk]] were her models. [[Ella Fitzgerald]] and the versatile vocalist, [[Tracy Nelson (singer)|Tracy Nelson]] were also important influences.<ref name=\"auto\" />\n\n== Early life and career ==\nMoffatt was born in Fort Worth, Texas.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608003961/Katy-Moffatt.html|title=Katy Moffatt Biography|website=www.musicianguide.com}}</ref> She left Fort Worth to attend [[Tulane University]] in New Orleans but ended up studying at [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College in Santa Fe, New Mexico]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Katy Moffatt – Biography & History | website=AllMusic | url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/katy-moffatt-mn0000365962/biography | access-date=September 20, 2019}}</ref> In Santa Fe, she developed a local following performing her songs at the college. Her local fame won her a part as a folk singer in [[Tom Laughlin]]'s movie, \"[[Billy Jack]].\"<ref>{{IMDb name|nm0595604}}</ref> In 1971, as an aspiring singer-songwriter, she moved to [[Denver]], Colorado to find an audience in the growing musical community there. While working a regular cocktail hour gig at a Denver hotel, Moffatt met Mary Flower and Randy Handley and who, along with Lon Ephraim, formed a band called Flower, Handley, and Moffatt. The band developed a following and traveled all over the state performing. Eventually, Moffatt and Flower became a duo and toured on the national coffeehouse circuit.\n\nMoffatt's frequent gigs as a solo performer at Ebbets Field, a prominent Denver music club, opened a door to the mainstream recording industry. From 1975 to 1979 she recorded for Columbia Records, making several singles and two albums – ''Katy'' (produced by [[Billy Sherrill]]) and ''Kissin' in the California Sun''.\n\n== On the road and recording career ==\nCoinciding with her recording at Columbia, Moffatt opened for such performers as [[Charlie Daniels]], [[Warren Zevon]], [[Muddy Waters]], and [[Steve Martin]], and she toured with [[Leo Kottke]]. She also worked with [[Willie Nelson]] and [[Andrew Gold]], appeared with [[Poco (band)|Poco]] and [[John Prine]], and toured with [[Jerry Jeff Walker]], [[JD Souther]] and the [[Allman Brothers]]. She also has done songs with [[Michael Martin Murphey]] such as \"Hard Country,\" \"Take It As It Comes,\" and a live version of \"Backsliders Wine\" on his 1979 album ''Peaks, Valleys, Honky-Tonks and Alleys''. For a brief time in the early 1980s, while waiting out two management contracts, Moffatt was a sought-after and featured touring harmony and duet singer for four prominent acts.<ref>{{cite book|last=Erlewine|first=Michael|title=All Music Guide to Country: The Experts' Guide to the Best Recordings in Country Music|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7Mo7xm-X1r4C|year=1997|publisher=Miller Freeman|isbn=978-0-87930-475-1}}</ref>\n\nWith that music industry experience behind her, she returned to making records including recording several songs for the short-lived Permian record label that were released to country radio and pursued an ever-expansive solo artist's path. She began making records as she wanted them to be made and licensed several gems which became favorites and remain so within her body of work thus far, including \"Walkin' On the Moon\", \"The Greatest Show on Earth\" (aka \"The Evangeline Hotel\"), \"Hearts Gone Wild\", and \"Angel Town\".\n\nLike many American singer-songwriters, Katy Moffatt is honored both abroad and in her own country. She regularly tours Europe and the U.K.\n\n== Industry recognition ==\n1985 [[Academy of Country Music]] nomination as Best New Female Vocalist<ref>{{cite web | title=Katy Moffatt: Biography | website=CMT | date=October 1, 2012| url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/moffatt_katy/bio.jhtml | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019193725/http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/moffatt_katy/bio.jhtml | archive-date=October 19, 2012 | url-status=dead | access-date=September 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Discography ==\n{{Main|Katy Moffatt discography}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{official website}}\n* {{AllMusic | id= katy-moffatt-mn0000365962 | label= Katy Moffatt}}\n* {{discogs artist|1539267-Katy-Moffatt|Katy Moffatt}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Moffatt, Katy}}\n[[Category:1950 births]]\n[[Category:American women country singers]]\n[[Category:American country singer-songwriters]]\n[[Category:American folk singers]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Singer-songwriters from Texas]]\n[[Category:Musicians from Fort Worth, Texas]]\n[[Category:St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe) alumni]]\n[[Category:Country musicians from Texas]]\n[[Category:21st-century American women]]"
