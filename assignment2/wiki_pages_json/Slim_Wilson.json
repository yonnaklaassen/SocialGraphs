Wilson was a mainstay of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC-TV]]’s ''[[Ozark Jubilee]]''; and hosted ABC's ''[[Talent Varieties]]'' in 1955 and his own local television show in [[Springfield, Missouri]], from 1964 to 1975.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early years===\n\nWilson was born in [[Christian County, Missouri]], just south of [[Nixa, Missouri|Nixa]] to John C. Wilson and Arlena J. Wilson (née Goddard),<ref>''Christian County Republican'' (July 6, 1967), p. 1</ref> who had come to [[Missouri]] in a covered wagon from the hills of [[Tennessee]]. He was the family's first son after six daughters: Cassie, Carrie, Edna, Bertha, Myrtle, and Vancie Martha. The entire family was known for being musical. Wilson attended schools in Harmony, [[Rosedale, Missouri|Rosedale]] and Line, then rode horseback to high school in Nixa.\n\nAbout 1930, his father rented a house on the family's ranch to the Hancock family from South Dakota. A year later, Wilson married Ada Hancock. By 1934, he was raising [[dairy cattle|dairy]] and [[beef cattle]] on 150 acres (60.7 hectares) north of [[Bolivar, Missouri]], on the [[Pomme de Terre River (Missouri)|Pomme de Terre River]]. His father bought the adjoining parcel.<ref name=\"Jamboree' 1948\">''Jamboree'' magazine (November 1948) Western Song Club, Ventura, Calif.</ref>\n\nThe Wilson family’s musicians would sometimes perform “together\" using a [[Party line (telephony)|telephone party line]]. Ten to 15 families could listen in, and neighbors would eavesdrop on the sessions for entertainment, often placing the earpiece in a bucket for amplification.<ref>Gage, Allen (ed) \"Old-time Fiddling: A Traditional Folk Art With Four Ozark Musicians\" (Spring 1982), ''Bittersweet'', Vol. IX, No.&nbsp;3</ref> Wilson soon won second place in a local fiddle competition.\n\n===Radio career===\n\nWilson formed The Goodwill Trio as \"Uncle Slim\" with his sister Vancie as \"Aunt Martha\" and her son, [[Speedy Haworth|Herschel \"Junior\" Haworth]]. The trio first appeared on [[KSGF (AM)|KGBX]] in Springfield in 1932; but moved to co-owned [[KWTO (AM)|KWTO]], the more powerful station, soon after it signed on in 1933. The group made its first public appearance in 1936 at the county courthouse in [[Galena, Missouri|Galena]] as a fundraiser to treat their father's broken leg. The trio later became The Goodwill Family when Guy Smith joined them as \"Uncle George.\"<ref>{{citation|first=Rita|last=Spears-Stewart|title=Remembering the Ozark Jubilee|publisher=Stewart, Dillbeck & White Productions|year=1993|isbn=0-9638648-0-7}}</ref>\n\nUnable to afford a car, Wilson hitchhiked to KWTO to appear with Zed Tennis; and later, with Si Perkins and Smokey Lohman.<ref name=\"Jamboree' 1948\"/> He was a part of many artist combinations on the station, including Slim and Shorty (a Nixa neighbor); and The Tall Timber Trio, with Haworth on guitar and Bob White on bass fiddle. He was also \"Whistler\" of Flash and Whistler (with Floyd \"Goo Goo\" Rutledge), a music-comedy duo. The station, heard across the Ozarks, was a stepping-stone during Wilson's years for such musicians as [[Porter Wagoner]], [[Les Paul]], [[Chet Atkins]] and [[The Browns]].\n\nWilson was responsible for giving [[Speedy West|Wesley West]] his nickname:  he introduced West to the audience as \"Speedy\" West at a pie social and jam session sponsored by KWTO.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.rockabillyhall.com/SpeedyWest1.html  | title = Speedy West| publisher = Rockabilly Hall of Fame | author =  | date = | accessdate = 2009-09-19}}</ref> He worked briefly at radio stations in Cedar Rapids, Iowa and Denver, Colorado before returning to the Ozarks.<ref name=\"Jamboree' 1948\"/> By the early 1950s, Wilson was among the top performers on KWTO, hosting the morning show sponsored by Martha White Flour (one advertiser created a Goodwill Family Flour brand). By 1954, he had done his 25,000th broadcast on the station. He also appeared on [[Red Foley]]’s network radio programs.<ref>''Ozark Jubilee Souvenir Picture Album'' (first edition, 1955)</ref>\n\n===Recording career===\n\nWilson recorded numerous transcriptions in the 1940s and 1950s but few commercial cuts.

In the summer of 1955, he hosted his own ABC program, ''Talent Varieties''.
