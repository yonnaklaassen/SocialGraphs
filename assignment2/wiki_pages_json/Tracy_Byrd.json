Signed to [[Universal Music Group Nashville|MCA Nashville]] Records in 1992, Byrd broke through on the country music scene that year with his 1993 single \"[[Holdin' Heaven]]\", which reached Number One on ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Singles & Tracks]]. Although he did not land a second Number One until 2002's \"[[Ten Rounds with Jose Cuervo]]\", Byrd has charted more than thirty hit singles in his career, including eleven additional Top Ten hits. He has also released ten studio albums and two greatest-hits albums, with four gold certifications and one double-platinum certification from the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]. He was the on-air spokesman for the TNN Outdoors block from 1998 to 2000.\n\n==Biography==\nTracy Lynn Byrd was born December 17, 1966. He is the eldest child of Jerry Lynn and Brenda Vaughn Byrd. Tracy Byrd graduated from [[Vidor High School]] in May 1985. His first college experience was at [[Lamar University]], Beaumont, Texas. He began studying business at [[Texas State University]] (then called Southwest Texas State). While studying he sang with a local band in Beaumont called Rimfire led by Jeffrey Adams and Dave Adams, a band that also featured acts such as [[Mark Chesnutt]].\n\nOne of his friends coaxed him into singing a cover of [[Hank Williams]]' \"[[Your Cheatin' Heart]]\" at a local mall recording studio.<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p37699/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Tracy Byrd biography|last=Huey|first=Steve|work=[[Allmusic]]|access-date=May 21, 2009}}</ref> The owner of the studio was so impressed with his version that he entered Byrd into a local talent contest.

Although it and follow-up \"Someone to Give My Love To\" (previously a single in 1971 for [[Johnny Paycheck]]<ref name=\"oldies\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oldies.com/artist-biography/Tracy-Byrd.html|title=Tracy Byrd biography|work=Oldies.com|access-date=May 21, 2009}}</ref>) both missed Top 40, he broke through in 1993 with the Number One hit \"[[Holdin' Heaven]]\".<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> This song was the third release from his self-titled [[Tracy Byrd (album)|debut album]], released by MCA on April 27, 1993. Although the album earned [[RIAA]] gold certification, its final single (\"Why Don't That Telephone Ring\") peaked at No.&nbsp;39. [[Keith Stegall]] and [[Tony Brown (record producer)|Tony Brown]] shared production duties on the album.\n\n====''No Ordinary Man''====\n''[[No Ordinary Man]]'' was the title of Byrd's second album, which was produced by [[Jerry Crutchfield]]. It was also his highest selling, earning a double-platinum certification for U.S. sales of two million copies. All four singles from the album reached Top Five: \"[[Lifestyles of the Not So Rich and Famous]]\", \"[[Watermelon Crawl]]\" (also his first entry on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], at No.&nbsp;81), \"[[The First Step (song)|The First Step]]\" and \"[[The Keeper of the Stars]]\".

It was led off by the No.&nbsp;15 \"Walkin' to Jerusalem\", followed by two ballads: the No.&nbsp;9-peaking title track and No.&nbsp;14 \"[[Heaven in My Woman's Eyes]]\", and finally the No.&nbsp;21-peaking \"[[4 to 1 in Atlanta]]\". This album also reunited him with Tony Brown, who would also produce all of his subsequent material for MCA.\n\n====''Big Love''====\n''[[Big Love (Tracy Byrd album)|Big Love]]'', released in 1996, was the title of Byrd's fourth album and its first single. \"[[Big Love (Tracy Byrd song)|Big Love]]\" returned him to the Top Five with a No.&nbsp;3 peak. After it came another Johnny Paycheck cover, this time of his 1971 single \"She's All I Got.\" Re-titled \"[[Don't Take Her She's All I Got]]\", Byrd's cover peaked at No.&nbsp;4. The album's other singles (\"Don't Love Make a Diamond Shine\" and \"Good Ol' Fashioned Love\") reached No.&nbsp;17 and No.&nbsp;47 respectively, with the latter being his first single since 1993 to miss Top 40. ''Big Love'' also became his third gold-selling album.\n\n====''I'm from the Country'' and ''Keepers: Greatest Hits''====\nByrd released his final studio album for MCA, ''[[I'm from the Country]]'', in late 1997. Its [[I'm from the Country (song)|title track]], co-written by Richard Young of [[The Kentucky Headhunters]] and former [[MCA Records]] artist [[Marty Brown (singer)|Marty Brown]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Artists/B/Byrd_Tracy/1998/06/11/743676.html|title=Byrd watching: Tracy Byrd continues his hit-making ways|last=Overall|first=Rick|date=June 1, 1998|work=Canoe – Jam!

This song was added to the album, which was originally to be titled ''Walkin' the Line'', after the rest of the album had already been completed. It also became his ninth Top 10 hit by reaching No.&nbsp;3 in early 1998 and his first No.&nbsp;1 on the ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' Country Tracks charts in Canada. Only one other single, the No.&nbsp;9 hit \"I Wanna Feel That Way Again\", was released from the album.\n\nIn 1999, Byrd then released a greatest-hits package entitled ''[[Keepers: Greatest Hits]]'', which is certified gold. This album was led off by the No.&nbsp;31 single \"When Mama Ain't Happy\" before he left the label.\n\n===1999–2004: RCA Records===\n\n====''It's About Time''====\nIn 1999, Byrd signed to [[RCA Records]] Nashville. Working with producer Billy Joe Walker, Jr., he released his sixth studio album, ''[[It's About Time (Tracy Byrd album)|It's About Time]]'', that year. This album featured a more [[country pop]] sound than its predecessors,<ref name=\"allmusic\"/><ref name=\"oldies\"/> and was led off by the No.&nbsp;11 \"[[Put Your Hand in Mine]]\". This song was co-written by [[Skip Ewing]] and [[Jimmy Wayne]]. The album's other two singles — \"[[Love, You Ain't Seen the Last of Me]]\" and \"Take Me With You When You Go\" — both landed outside the Top 40.\n\n====''Ten Rounds''====\n''[[Ten Rounds (Tracy Byrd album)|Ten Rounds]]'', his second album for RCA, was released in 2001. This album returned him to a more traditionally country sound.<ref name=\"oldies\"/> It was led off by \"A Good Way to Get on My Bad Side\", a duet with Mark Chesnutt.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> This song was a No.&nbsp;21 country hit, and Chesnutt's first Top 40 chart hit since \"This Heartache Never Sleeps\" two years previous. After it came the No.&nbsp;9 \"Just Let Me Be in Love\", and finishing off the album's single releases was its title track, \"[[Ten Rounds with José Cuervo]]\". In October 2002, this song became Byrd's second No. 1 country hit,<ref name=\"oldies\"/> and his first since \"Holdin' Heaven\" in 1993. It was also his only Top 40 pop hit, with a No.&nbsp;26 peak on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].\n\n====''The Truth About Men''====\nByrd charted at No.&nbsp;38 in early 2003 with \"Lately (Been Dreamin' 'Bout Babies)\", which was never included on an album.<ref name=\"whitburn\"/> This song was followed by \"The Truth About Men\", a song whose second verse featured guest vocals from [[Blake Shelton]], [[Andy Griggs]] and [[Montgomery Gentry]]. This song was the title track to his final RCA album, ''[[The Truth About Men (album)|The Truth About Men]]'', which also produced his final Top Ten hit in the No.&nbsp;7 \"[[Drinkin' Bone]]\", as well as the No.&nbsp;53 \"How'd I Wind Up in Jamaica.\" Also included on this album was the [[Rodney Crowell]] composition \"[[Making Memories of Us]]\", which would later be a Number One country hit in 2005 for [[Keith Urban]].\n\n===2005: BNA Records===\n\n====''Greatest Hits''====\nByrd's second [[Greatest Hits (Tracy Byrd album)|greatest hits]] album was released in 2005 via [[BNA Records]], a sister label to RCA. This album reprised most of his RCA single releases, and included new recordings of \"I'm from the Country\" and \"The Keeper of the Stars.\" Also included on it were the new tracks \"Revenge of a Middle-Aged Woman\", \"Tiny Town\" and \"[[Johnny Cash (Tracy Byrd song)|Johnny Cash]]\". The first two were released as singles, with the former reaching No.&nbsp;34 and the latter failing to chart. \"Johnny Cash\" was later covered by [[Jason Aldean]] on his 2007 album ''[[Relentless (Jason Aldean album)|Relentless]]'', and was a No.&nbsp;6 country hit for him that year.\n\n===2006–present: Blind Mule Records & later work===\n\n====''Different Things''====\nByrd released his next album, ''[[Different Things]]'', in 2006 via his own Blind Mule label. It was led off by the No.&nbsp;55 \"Cheapest Motel\",<ref name=\"whitburn\"/> co-written by Cole Deggs of [[Cole Deggs & the Lonesome]]. After this song came \"Better Places Than This,\" which failed to chart as well.\n\n===='' All American Texan '' ====\nIn June 2016, Byrd returned to the studio to work on his first project in a decade. This album, recorded at Rosewood Studios in Tyler, Texas, was self-produced and promoted. Byrd wrote eight of the album's ten tracks himself. The album was released in October 2016.\n\n===='' Tracy Byrd : Live at Billy Bob's Texas '' ====\nIn November 2019 Byrd released a live album, recorded in June 2019 with his band, The ByrdDawgs. The album was recorded at Billy Bob's Texas, and holds nineteen songs.\n\n===='' Tracy Byrd : Live at Billy Bob's Texas DVD '' ====\n\nThe DVD of Byrd's Billy Bob's Texas concert in June 2019, was released in November 2019. In addition to the music, it contains several interview segments with Byrd.\n\n==Charitable efforts==\nByrd has been the National Spokesperson for [[Special Olympics]] International for the [[Country Music Association]]. He developed a crank bait fishing lure marketed by Norman Lures called ''The Lifestyles of the Not So Rich & Famous''', named after his hit recording of the song written by [[Byron Hill]] and Wayne Tester. For every one of the lures sold Byrd donated ten cents to the Special Olympics.\n\nFor several years Byrd hosted an annual golfing/fishing/music event, \"The Tracy Byrd Homecoming Weekend,\" later called \"The Beaumont Boys Bash\", in Southeast Texas to raise money for local charities, including the [[March of Dimes]], the [[Children's Miracle Network]], and culminating in the donation of money to fund the Tracy Byrd [[Hyperbaric Medicine]] and Wound Care Center at St. Elizabeth's Hospital in Beaumont. Byrd also raised money by soliciting pledges for his attempt to complete the 2002 Houston Marathon. He finished the marathon, and donated all of his pledges to the Children's Miracle Network.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tseentertainment.com/tracy-byrd/|title=All About Tracy|access-date=June 26, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003 Byrd published ''Eat Like a Byrd: The Tracy Byrd Cookbook''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.museumofthegulfcoast.org/Content/Personalities/Music_Legends/Tracy_Byrd |title=Museum of the Gulf Coast - Tracy Byrd |access-date=January 5, 2007 |archive-date=December 7, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061207222555/http://museumofthegulfcoast.org/Content/Personalities/Music_Legends/Tracy_Byrd |url-status=dead }}</ref> He also launched a line of spices, rubs, and marinades to go along with it, called \"Tracy Byrd's Tiny Town Products\"; a portion of these sales were donated to the [[Children's Miracle Network]].\n\nOn December 28, 2012, he performed \"Amazing Grace\" at the memorial service for [[KFDM]] news anchor Bill Leger.<ref>{{cite news |last=Mieux |first=Mary |date=December 28, 2012 |title=KFDM's Bill Leger remembered |url=https://www.panews.com/2012/12/28/kfdms-bill-leger-remembered/ |work=Port Arthur News |location=online |access-date=November 10, 2019 }}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n{{Main|Tracy Byrd discography}}\n\n===Studio albums===\n*''[[Tracy Byrd (album)|Tracy Byrd]]'' (1993)\n*''[[No Ordinary Man]]'' (1994)\n*''[[Love Lessons (album)|Love Lessons]]'' (1995)\n*''[[Big Love (Tracy Byrd album)|Big Love]]'' (1996)\n*''[[I'm from the Country]]'' (1998)\n*''[[It's About Time (Tracy Byrd album)|It's About Time]]'' (1999)\n*''[[Ten Rounds (Tracy Byrd album)|Ten Rounds]]'' (2001)\n*''[[The Truth About Men (album)|The Truth About Men]]'' (2003)\n*''[[Different Things]]'' (2006)\n*''All American Texan'' (2016)\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n=== American Music Awards ===\n\n{{awards table}}\n|-\n|[[American Music Awards of 1994|1994]]\n|Tracy Byrd\n|[[American Music Award for Favorite Country New Artist|Favorite Country New Artist]]\n|{{nom}}\n|}\n\n=== TNN/Music City News Country Awards ===\n\n{{awards table}}\n|-\n|[[29th TNN/Music City News Country Awards|1995]]\n|Tracy Byrd\n|Male Star of Tomorrow\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|[[30th TNN/Music City News Country Awards|1996]]\n|\"[[The Keeper of the Stars]]\"\n|Single of the Year\n|{{nom}}\n|}\n\n=== Academy of Country Music Awards ===\n\n{{awards table}}\n|-\n|[[31st Academy of Country Music Awards|1996]]\n|\"[[The Keeper of the Stars]]\"\n|Song of the Year\n|{{won}}\n|-\n|[[39th Academy of Country Music Awards|2004]]\n|\"[[The Truth About Men (album)|The Truth About Men]]\"\n|Vocal Event of the Year\n|{{nom}}\n|}\n\n=== Country Music Association Awards ===\n\n{{awards table}}\n|-\n|[[1995 Country Music Association Awards|1995]]\n|\"[[The Keeper of the Stars]]\"\n|[[Country Music Association Award for Single of the Year|Single of the Year]]\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|[[2003 Country Music Association Awards|2003]]\n|\"[[The Truth About Men (album)|The Truth About Men]]\"\n|[[Country Music Association Award for Musical Event of the Year|Vocal Event of the Year]]\n|{{nom}}\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Tracy Byrd}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Byrd, Tracy}}\n[[Category:1966 births]]\n[[Category:American country singer-songwriters]]\n[[Category:American male singer-songwriters]]\n[[Category:Country musicians from Texas]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Musicians from Beaumont, Texas]]\n[[Category:Singer-songwriters from Texas]]\n[[Category:MCA Records artists]]\n[[Category:RCA Records Nashville artists]]\n[[Category:People from Vidor, Texas]]"
