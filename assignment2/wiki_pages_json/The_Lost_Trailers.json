Established in 2000, the band originally comprised Ryder Lee ([[lead vocals]], [[keyboard instrument|keyboards]]), Manny Medina (guitar), Andrew Nielson ([[bass guitar]]), Stokes Nielson (vocals, [[lead guitar]]), and Jeff Potter ([[drum kit|drums]]). Originally known as Stokes Nielson and the Lost Trailers, the band made its debut at a [[Fourth of July]] picnic held by country singer [[Willie Nelson]]. That year, the Lost Trailers self-released its debut album ''Story of the New Age Cowboy'', followed in 2002 by ''Trailer Trash'', followed by 2004's ''Welcome to the Woods'' on [[Universal Records|Universal]]/[[Republic Records|Republic]]. After switching to [[BNA Records]] in 2006, the band issued a self-titled effort, which produced the singles \"Call Me Crazy\" and \"Why Me\", both of which entered the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts. A fifth album, ''[[Holler Back]]'', was released in August 2008, producing a top ten country hit in its title track and a top 20 in \"How 'Bout You Don't\".\n\nIn 2011, singer/songwriter Jason Wyatt joined Stokes Nielson, launching a re-establishment of the Lost Trailers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thelosttrailers.com/bio/ |title=The Lost Trailers - Biography|website=Thelosttrailers.com |accessdate=2012-01-18}}</ref> This re-established group released the single \"Underdog\" with the record label HRT Records & Productions, and then released \"American Beauty\". Lead singer Jason Wyatt announced he was departing the duo in April 2014 to focus on a solo career.\n\n==History==\nStokes Nielson and Ryder Lee began writing and producing music together in [[Albany, Georgia]].<ref name=\"red\">{{cite web |url=http://www.redlightmanagement.com/artist.php?sect=artist&num=54 |title=The Lost Trailers |accessdate=2007-12-21 |work=Red Light Management}}</ref> Their first album together was the self-issued ''The Story of the New Age Cowboy'' in 2000.<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p646610|pure_url=yes}} |title=The Lost Trailers biography |accessdate=2007-12-21 |last=Brown |first=Marisa |work=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> Initially, Ryder and Stokes worked with a bass guitarist and a drummer, forming a group known as Stokes Nielson & the Lost Trailers (later shortened to The Lost Trailers). The name was derived from the fact that the band's equipment trailers had been stolen on three separate occasions.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/><ref name=\"weekly\">{{cite journal |last=Neal |first=Chris |date=2007-09-11 |title=Who's New: The Lost Trailers |journal=[[Country Weekly]] |volume=13 |issue=19 |page=72 }}</ref>\n\nAt the time, Stokes Nielson was also working as a [[disc jockey]] for a radio station in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. In 2000, after an on-air interview with [[Willie Nelson]], Stokes offered him a demo version of the Lost Trailers' material. Nelson then offered the band an opportunity to play at a [[Fourth of July]] picnic, which he held annually in [[Texas]].<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> Stokes took to the role of lead singer, while Ryder played keyboards and provided backing vocals.<ref name=\"rockzilla\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dixie-chicks.com/rockzilla/miller1.html|title=The Lost Trailers The Story Of The New Age Cowboy|last=Miller|first=David}}</ref>\n\nEventually, the band's membership was later finalized with Lee on keyboards, Stokes' younger brother, Andrew, on bass guitar, Jeff Potter on drums, and Manny Medina on bass guitar.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> The band then gained a following throughout the Southeast and Texas, performing more than 200 shows yearly.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/>\n\n===First albums===\nIn 2002, the Lost Trailers recorded their second album, entitled ''Trailer Trash''. A third album, ''Welcome to the Woods'', followed two years later on [[Universal Records|Universal]]/[[Republic Records]], although its singles failed to chart.\n\nRecord producer [[Blake Chancey]], who has worked with the [[Dixie Chicks]] and [[Waylon Jennings]], saw the band perform at a concert in [[Fort Worth, Texas]], and offered to work with them. Renee Bell, a talent executive for [[BNA Records]], had also seen the Lost Trailers perform at another concert. She then recommended the band to the label's president, and the Lost Trailers were signed to a recording contract with BNA in 2006.<ref name=\"red\"/> At this point, Lee took over the role of lead vocalist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hearya.com/2007/06/17/the-lost-trailers-%E2%80%93-from-heroes-to-zeroes/|title=The Lost Trailers – From Heroes to Zeroes|date=17 June 2007|work=Hear Ya|accessdate=12 December 2013}}</ref> Their first chart single, \"[[Chicken Fried]]\", was released in early 2006, peaking at number 53 on the [[Hot Country Songs]] charts. This single was withdrawn because Zac Brown, who wrote the song, had a clause in the licensing contract that they were not allowed to release the song as a single, which they did, and he wanted to record the song himself.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allbusiness.com/services/motion-pictures/4477828-1.html |title= BNA Forced To Swap Trailers' Single |accessdate=2008-06-19 |last=Tucker |first=Ken |date=2006-03-15 |work=Radio Monitor}}</ref> Brown ultimately recorded the song as a member of the [[Zac Brown Band]], whose rendition was a number one hit in late 2008. Despite the cease and desist, the band continued to occasionally perform \"Chicken Fried\" live, as recently as 2012.<ref>{{YouTube |ZFxVuJ3eDEA |The Lost Trailers - \"Chicken Fried\"}}</ref>\n\n\"Chicken Fried\" was then withdrawn and replaced with \"Call Me Crazy\", which peaked at number 43. Following it was \"Why Me\", which reached number 45. These latter two songs were both included on the Lost Trailers' [[The Lost Trailers (album)|self-titled album]] for BNA, which was issued in August of that year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://magazine.angrycountry.com/article.php?story=2006100414040170 |title=New Artist Spotlight: The Lost Trailers |accessdate=2007-12-21 |last=Cronin |first=Peter |date=2006-10-04 |work=Angry Country}}</ref>\n\n===2008===\nIn 2008, the Lost Trailers went on a nationwide tour with fellow country music artists [[Keith Anderson]] and [[Chris Young (singer)|Chris Young]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.countryhound.com/News/Article.aspx?p=979&AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1 |title=Keith Anderson Says C'mon 2008 |accessdate=2008-02-15 |last=Betts |first=Stephen |date=2008-01-04 |work=Country Hound |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080311063832/http://www.countryhound.com/News/Article.aspx?p=979 |archivedate=March 11, 2008 }}</ref> The band's fourth single for BNA, \"[[Holler Back (song)|Holler Back]]\", was released in early 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thelosttrailers.com/?em1776=185662_-1__0_~0_-1_2_2008_0_0&content=journal|title=Hey Ya'll from the snowy Midwest |accessdate=2008-02-16 |last=Nielson |first=Stokes |date=2008-02-05 |work=Band Journal}}</ref> \"Holler Back\", which reached #9 on the country charts in late 2008, is also the title track to the band's [[Holler Back|second album]] for BNA. The band was also nominated for Top New Vocal Duo or Group and Top Vocal Group at the 2009 [[Academy of Country Music]] awards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://acmcountry.com/awards/nominees.php|title=Nominees|work=[[Academy of Country Music]]|accessdate=2009-08-06}}</ref>\n\nFollowing \"Holler Back\" was \"How 'bout You Don't\", which was released in October and peaked in the top 20. \"All This Love\" was originally to have been the third single, but after \"Country Folks Livin' Loud\" charted as an album cut, it was sent to radio as the third single instead. They were nominated again for the 2010 Academy of Country Music Top New Vocal Group.\n\nIn May 2010, the band announced that it would disband following its last concerts in September.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.gactv.com/blog/2010/05/28/lost-trailers-reach-end-of-the-road/|title=Lost Trailers reach end of the road|last=Roland|first=Tom|date=28 May 2010|work=[[Great American Country]]|accessdate=1 June 2010|archive-date=1 June 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601051616/http://blog.gactv.com/blog/2010/05/28/lost-trailers-reach-end-of-the-road/|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===2011===\nIn 2011, the Lost Trailers released a collaboration single with Corbette Jackson, entitled \"Heart of a Champion\".<ref name=\"iTunes\">{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/heart-champion-feat-the-lost/id42468743|title=Heart of a Champion (feat.

Stokes Nielson also performed a special concert in Albany, Georgia with Jackson and Jason Wyatt.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.albanyherald.com/news/headlines/Champion_tour_comes_to_Albany_119817369.html|title='Champion' tour comes to Albany|last=Fletcher|first=Carlton|date=13 April 2011|work=Albany Herald|accessdate=12 June 2011}}</ref>\n\nAfter several band members left to pursue other interests, Nielson started over with the Lost Trailers, joining with collaborator and lead vocalist Jason Wyatt.  The Lost Trailers opted to work with Harrison Tobin of HRT Records & Productions for the release of their next single.  The first radio single, \"Underdog\", was released in late 2011 by HRT Records & Productions. It made the top 40 on the country charts. \"American Beauty\" followed in mid-2012. Wyatt announced his departure in April 2014.
