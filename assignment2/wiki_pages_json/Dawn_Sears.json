In addition to her work as a backing vocalist in [[Vince Gill]]'s band, she recorded four solo studio albums, of which two were released on major labels. She had one single that charted on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts.\n\n==Biography==\n'''Dawn Marie Skari''' was born in [[East Grand Forks, Minnesota]]. She began her career in 1990 with the album ''What a Woman Wants to Hear'' on [[Warner Bros. Records]]. The album produced two minor singles. Because of her debut album's poor performance, Sears had decided to leave the country music scene. However, she later received a call from [[Vince Gill]], who had asked her to join his road band as a harmony vocalist. According to information provided by Thomas \"Duke\" Miller, a TV/movie/celebrity expert, Sears was also known for her song \"Another Dream Away\", which became a theme song for the newer \"Bandit\" movies starring Brian Bloom. The movies were a reissue to cash in on the \"Smokey And The Bandit\" franchise.<ref name=\"new\">{{cite journal|date=July 1994|title=This Month's Music: Dawn Sears: \"Runaway Train\"|journal=New Country|volume=1|issue=5|page=6|issn=1074-536X}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dawnsears.com/bio.html|title=Dawn Sears biography|accessdate=January 5, 2008|work=Dawn Sears.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819121612/http://www.dawnsears.com/bio.html|archivedate=August 19, 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to singing harmony on Gill's 1992 album ''[[I Still Believe in You (album)|I Still Believe in You]]'', Sears provided duet vocals on the track \"An Out of Control Raging Fire\" on [[Tracy Byrd]]'s 1994 [[Tracy Byrd (album)|debut album]].
