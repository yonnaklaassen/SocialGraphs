She performs with her musical partner, guitarist [[David Rawlings]]. Their sparse and dark musical style, which combines elements of [[Appalachian music]], [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]], [[country music|country]] and [[Americana (music)|Americana]], is described by ''[[The New Yorker]]'' as \"at once innovative and obliquely reminiscent of past rural forms.\"<ref name=\"new_yorker\" />\n\nWelch and Rawlings have collaborated on nine critically acclaimed albums, five released under her name, three released under Rawlings' name, and two under both of their names. Her 1996 debut, ''[[Revival (Gillian Welch album)|Revival]]'', and the 2001 release ''[[Time (The Revelator)]]'', received nominations for the [[Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album]]. Her 2003 album, ''[[Soul Journey]]'', introduced electric guitar, drums, and a more upbeat sound to their body of work. After a gap of eight years, she released a fifth studio album, ''[[The Harrow & the Harvest]]'', in 2011, which was also nominated for a Grammy for Best Contemporary Folk Album. In 2020, Welch and Rawlings released ''[[All the Good Times (Are Past & Gone)]]'', which won the 2021 [[Grammy Award for Best Folk Album]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|last=Hussey|first=Allison|date=March 14, 2021|title=Gillian Welch and David Rawlings Win Best Folk Album at 2021 Grammys|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/gillian-welch-and-david-rawlings-win-best-folk-album-at-2021-grammys/|access-date=December 28, 2021|website=Pitchfork|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nWelch was an associate producer and performed on two songs of the [[O Brother, Where Art Thou?

This song exemplifies Welch and Rawlings' minimal arrangements and Welch's lyrics about outcasts}}\nAs a child, Welch was introduced to the music of American [[folk singers]] [[Bob Dylan]], [[Woody Guthrie]], and the [[Carter Family]]. She performed folk songs with her peers at the [[The Westland School (Los Angeles)|Westland Elementary School]] in Los Angeles.<ref name=\"new_yorker\" /><ref name=\"la_times_2004\"/> Welch later attended [[Crossroads School (Santa Monica, California)|Crossroads School]], a high school in [[Santa Monica, California]]. While in high school, a local television program featured her as a student who \"excelled at everything she did.\"<ref name=\"new_yorker\" />\n\nWhile a student at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]], Welch played bass in a [[goth music|goth]] band, and drums in a [[psychedelic rock|psychedelic]] [[surf rock|surf]] band.<ref name=\"new_yorker\" /> In college, a roommate played an album by the bluegrass band [[The Stanley Brothers]], and she had an [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]]:\n\n<blockquote>The first song came on and I just stood up and I kind of walked into the other room as if I was in a tractor beam and stood there in front of the stereo. It was just as powerful as the electric stuff, and it was songs I'd grown up singing. All of a sudden I'd found my music.<ref name=\"sf_chronicle_2005\" /></blockquote>\n\nAfter graduating from UC Santa Cruz with a degree in photography, Welch attended the [[Berklee College of Music]] in [[Boston]], where she majored in songwriting.<ref name=\"nodep_book\" /> During her two years studying at Berklee, Welch gained confidence as a performer.<ref name=\"new_yorker\" /><ref name=\"nodep_book\" /> Welch met her music partner [[David Rawlings]] at a successful audition for Berklee's only country band.<ref name=\"boston_globe_2003\" /><ref name=\"theage_bevhillybilly\" />\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Gillian Smile.jpg|right|thumb|alt=A man with his head down playing a guitar with a smiling Welch also playing guitar on stage. Both play in front of microphones.|Rawlings and Welch performing in Seattle in 2009]]\nUpon finishing college in 1992, Welch moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]].<ref name=\"times_london_2003\" /> She recalled, \"I looked at my record collection and saw that all the music I loved had been made in Nashville—[[Bill Monroe]], Dylan, [[the Stanley Brothers]], [[Neil Young]]—so I moved there. Not ever thinking I was thirty years too late.\"<ref name=\"new_yorker\" /> Rawlings soon followed. In Nashville, after singing \"[[Long Black Veil (song)|Long Black Veil]],\" the two first realized that their voices harmonized well and they started to perform as a duo.<ref name=\"new_yorker\" /> They never considered using a working name, so the duo were simply billed as \"Gillian Welch.\"<ref name=\"new_yorker\" /> A year after moving to Nashville, Welch found a [[Talent manager|manager]], [[Denise Stiff]], who already managed [[Alison Krauss]]. Both Welch and Stiff ignored frequent advice that Welch should stop playing with Rawlings and join a band.<ref name=\"new_yorker\" /><ref name=\"la_times_2004\" /> They eventually signed a recording contract with [[Almo Sounds]].<ref name=\"la_times_2004\" /> Following a performance opening for [[Peter Rowan]] at the [[Station Inn]], producer [[T-Bone Burnett]] expressed interest in recording an album. Burnett did not plan to disturb Welch's and Rawlings' preference for minimal instrumentation, and Welch agreed to take him on as a producer.<ref name=\"no_dep_1996\" />\n\n===''Revival''===\nFor the recording sessions of Welch's debut, ''[[Revival (Gillian Welch album)|Revival]]'', Burnett wanted to recapture the bare sound of Welch's live performance.<ref name=\"no_dep_1996\" /> Welch recalled, \"That first week was really intense. It was just T-Bone, the engineer, and Dave and myself. We got so inside our little world. There was very little distance between our singing and playing. The sound was very immediate. It was so light and small.\"<ref name=\"no_dep_1996\" /> Later, they recorded several more songs and played with an expanded group of musicians:  guitarist and [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] inductee [[James Burton]], bassist [[Roy Huskey, Jr.]], and veteran session drummers [[Jim Keltner]] and [[Buddy Harman]].<ref name=\"no_dep_1996\" />\n\nThe album was released in April 1996 to mostly positive reviews. Mark Deming of [[Allmusic]] called it a \"superb debut\" and wrote, \"Welch's debts to artists of the past are obvious and clearly acknowledged, but there's a maturity, intelligence, and keen eye for detail in her songs you wouldn't expect from someone simply trying to ape the Carter Family.\"<ref name=\"amg_revival\" /> Bill Friskics-Warren of ''[[No Depression (magazine)|No Depression]]'' praised the album as \"breathtakingly austere evocations of rural culture.\"<ref name=\"no_dep_1996\" /> The Arlington Heights, Illinois ''[[Daily Herald (Arlington Heights)|Daily Herald]]''{{'}}s Mark Guarino observed that ''Revival'' was \"cheered and scrutinized as a staunch revivalist of Depression-era music only because her originals sounded so much like that era.\" He attributed this to the biblical imagery of the lyrics, Burnett's threadbare production, and the plainly-sung bleakness in Welch's vocals.<ref name=\"cdh_2003\" /> [[Ann Powers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' gave ''Revival'' a lukewarm review and criticized Welch for not singing of her own experiences, and \"manufacturing emotion.\"<ref name=\"rollingstone_revival\" /> [[Robert Christgau]] echoed Powers: Welch \"just doesn't have the voice, eye, or way with words to bring her simulation off.\"<ref name=\"robchrist_revival\" />\n\nThe song, \"Orphan Girl,\" from ''Revival'' has been covered by Emmylou Harris, Ann Wilson, Karin Bergquist of Over the Rhine, Mindy Smith, Patty Griffin, Linda Ronstadt, Tim & Mollie O'Brien and Holly Williams.\n\nOthers who have recorded Welch's songs include Joan Baez, Grace Porter, Courtney Barnett and Kurt Vile, Punch Brothers, Mike Gordon, Bright Eyes, Calexico, Ani DiFranco, The Decemberists, [[Karl Blau]], Jim James, and JD Pinkus.\n\n''Revival'' was nominated for the [[Grammy Awards of 1997|1997]] [[Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album]], but lost to [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s ''[[The Ghost of Tom Joad]].''<ref name=\"nodep_1998\" />\n\n===''Hell Among the Yearlings''===\nThe duo's 1998 ''Hell Among the Yearlings'' continued the rustic and dark themes; the songs' subject matter varies from a female character killing a rapist, a mining accident, a [[murder ballad]], and an ode to [[morphine]] before death.<ref name=\"rs_hell\" /> Like ''Revival'', ''Hell Among The Yearlings'' featured a sparse style that focused on Rawlings and Welch's voices and guitars.<ref name=\"rs_hell\" /><ref name=\"wsj_1998\" />\n\n[[File:Gillian Welch 2007.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Welch singing and playing guitar on stage, wearing a black dress.|Welch performing at the 2007 New Orleans [[Jazz&nbsp;Fest]]]] \nThe album also received favorable reviews. [[Robert Wilonsky]] of the ''[[Dallas Observer]]'' observed that Welch \"inhabits a role so completely, the fiction separating character and audience disappears\".<ref name=\"dallas_hell\" /> Thom Owens (Allmusic) stated that the album \"lacks some of the focus\" of ''Revival'', but is \"a thoroughly satisfying second album\" and proof that her debut was not a fluke.<ref name=\"amg_hell\" /> ''No Depression'''s Farnum Brown commended the live and \"immediate feel\" of the album, Welch's [[clawhammer banjo]],<ref name=\"livedaily_2004\" /> and Rawlings' harmonies.<ref name=\"nodep_1998\" /> Similar to ''Revival'', Welch was praised for reflecting influences such as the Stanley Brothers, but still managing to create an original sound,<ref name=\"wsj_1998\" /> while Chris Herrington from [[Minneapolis]]'s ''[[City Pages]]'' criticized the songs' lack of authenticity.

Welch explained, \"As opposed to being little tiny folk songs or traditional songs, they're really tiny rock songs. They're just performed in this acoustic setting. In our heads we went electric without changing instruments.\"<ref name=\"amg_time\" />\n\n''Time (The Revelator)'' received extensive critical praise, most of which focused on the evolution of lyrics from mountain ballads.<ref name=\"nodep_2001\" /><ref name=\"amg_time\" /><ref name=\"charleston_gazette\" /> For Michael Shannon Friedman of ''[[The Charleston Gazette]]'', \"Welch's soul-piercing, backwoods quaver has always been a treasure, but on this record her songwriting is absolutely stunning.\"<ref name=\"charleston_gazette\" /> Critics compare the last track, the 15-minute \"I Dream a Highway\", to classics by Bob Dylan and [[Neil Young]].

The Rawlings releases generally feature a larger string band and more lush arrangements than their “Gillian Welch” material, and have usually been released under the band name [[Dave Rawlings Machine]]. Andy Gill of ''[[The Independent]]'' described the band’s 2009 debut album ''A Friend of a Friend'' as \"akin to one of Welch's albums, but with the balance of their harmonies swapped to favour Rawlings' voice\".<ref name=\"guardian_rawlings\" /> Welch co-wrote five of the songs with Rawlings, and provided guitar and harmony vocals.<ref name=\"tenn_blog\" /><ref name=\"popmatters_rawlings\" />  Although ostensibly Rawlings' first solo album, Alex Ramon of ''[[PopMatters]]'' noted the similarities to Welch albums.<ref name=\"popmatters_rawlings\" /> ''Paste Magazine''{{'}}s [[Stephen Deusner]] praised ''A Friend of a Friend'' for incorporating \"a wide swath of traditional American music,\" comments echoed by ''Rolling Stone''{{'}}s Will Hermes and in the ''PopMatters'' piece.<ref name=\"popmatters_rawlings\" /><ref name=\"paste_rawlings_review\" /><ref name=\"rolling_stone_rawlings\" />\n\nOn September 18, 2015, the duo released their second album under the band title Dave Rawlings Machine, ''Nashville Obsolete''.

The song “Cumberland Gap,” which features on the album, was nominated for the 2018 [[Grammy Award for Best American Roots Song]].

People would flat-out ask me, 'Don't you have any happy love songs?' Well, as a matter of fact, I don't. I've got songs about orphans and morphine addicts.\"<ref name=\"times_london_2003\" /> To reflect these themes, Welch and Rawlings often employ a slow pace to their songs. Their tempo is compared to a \"slow heartbeat\", and Cowperthwait of ''Rolling Stone'' observed that their songs \"can lull you into near-hypnosis and then make your jaw drop with one final revelation\".<ref name=\"new_yorker\" /><ref name=\"rs_1998\" />\n\n===Reception===\n[[File:Gillian welch.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.66|alt=Welch in a green tanktop sings into a microphone while playing guitar.|Welch performing at the 2009 [[Newport&nbsp;Folk&nbsp;Festival]]]]\n[[Geoffrey Himes]] of ''The Washington Post'' described Welch as \"one of the most interesting singer-songwriters of her generation\".<ref name=\"wash_post_2001\" /> In 2003, Tom Kielty of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' observed that she was \"quietly establishing one of the most impressive catalogs in contemporary roots music\", and a 2007 piece in ''The Guardian'' by John Harris called Welch \"one of the decade's greatest talents\".<ref name=\"guardian_2007\" /><ref name=\"boston_2003\" /> Critic [[Robert Hilburn]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote, \"At every turn, she demonstrates a spark and commitment that should endear her to anyone from country and folk to pop and rock fans who appreciate imagination and heart.\"<ref name=\"latimes_1996\" />\n\nWhen Welch's first two albums came out, critics questioned the authenticity of her music, as she was raised in [[Southern California]], but performed [[Appalachia]]n themed songs.<ref name=\"theage_bevhillybilly\" /><ref name=\"wsj_1998\" /><ref name=\"boston_globe_1998\" /> For ''Revival'', Welch was criticized for \"manufacturing emotion\", and a review of ''Hell Among the Yearlings'' by Chris Herrington of ''City Pages'' stated, \"Welch is someone who discovered old-time music in college and decided that her own sheltered life could never be worth writing about\", and that she is \"completely devoid of individuality\".<ref name=\"rollingstone_revival\" /><ref name=\"minn_city_pages\" /> Other critics rejected the notion that her background affects the authenticity of her music. Music critic [[Mark Kemp]] defended Welch in a ''[[New York Times]]'' piece:\n\n<blockquote>The first-person protagonist of Ms. Welch's song (\"Caleb Meyer\") may be a young girl from a time and place that Ms. Welch will never fully understand, but the feelings the singer expresses about rape, and the respect she displays for her chosen musical genre, are nothing if not poignantly authentic. Likewise, it matters not whether Ms. Welch has ever walked the streets of \"the black dust towns of [[East Tennessee]]\" about which she sings in \"Miner's Refrain\" because the sense of foreboding that she expresses for the men who once labored in coal mines with futile hopes of a better life comes through loud and clear.<ref name=\"nyt_1998\" /> </blockquote>\n\n''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'''s Taylor Holliday echoed this: \"Stingy critics give Ms. Welch a hard time because she's a California city girl, not an Appalachian coal miner's daughter. But as [[Lucinda Williams|Lucinda]] or Emmylou might attest, love of the music is not a birthright, but an earned right. Listen to Ms. Welch yodel, in a tune about that no-good \"gal\" Morphine, and you know she's as mountain as they come.\"<ref name=\"wsj_1998\" />\n\nOn September 16, 2015, the duo was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award for Songwriting by the Americana Music Association.\n\n===Influences and collaborations===\n[[File:Bob Weir & Gillian Welch.jpg|left|thumb|alt=A bearded man who looks to be in his 60s wearing a dark red shirt and Welch, smiling, with her arm around him.

She said that \"by and large I listen to people who are dead. I'm really of the tried-and-true school. I let 50 years go by and see what's really relevant.\"<ref name=\"boston_globe_1998\" /> Welch has acknowledged inspiration from several traditional country artists, including the Stanley Brothers, the [[Carter Family]], the [[Louvin Brothers]], and the [[Blue Sky Boys]].<ref name=\"new_yorker\" /><ref name=\"nyt_feb_2004\" /> She explained her relationship with traditional music by saying, \"I've never tried to be traditional.

However, it was clear I was never going to be able to do exactly that; I'm a songwriter.\"<ref name=\"newzealand_2004\" />\n\nIn addition to the strong country influence, Welch also draws on a repertoire of such rock 'n' roll artists as Bob Dylan, [[Chuck Berry]], [[Neil Young]], the [[Grateful Dead]] and the [[Velvet Underground]].<ref name=\"new_yorker\" /><ref name=\"theage_bevhillybilly\" /><ref name=\"metro_sv\" /> She has noted [[alternative rock]] bands [[Throwing Muses]], [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]] and [[Camper Van Beethoven]] \"don't directly inform my music, but they're in there.\"<ref name=\"boston_globe_1998\" /><ref name=\"metro_sv\" /> Her cover of [[The Bends (album)|Black Star]] by [[Radiohead]] became well-known and was released as a single in 2005.\n\nWelch has recorded songs with a variety of notable artists, including [[Ryan Adams]], [[Ani DiFranco]], [[Emmylou Harris]], Jay Farrar, [[Alison Krauss]], [[Old Crow Medicine Show]], [[Bright Eyes (band)|Bright Eyes]], [[Robyn Hitchcock]], [[Steve Earle]], [[Ralph Stanley]], [[Sara Watkins]], [[The Decemberists]], [[Solomon Burke]] and [[Mark Knopfler]].<ref name=\"boston_globe_2003\" /><ref name=\"theage_bevhillybilly\" /><ref name=\"paste_rawlings_review\" /><ref name=\"rs_hitchcock\" /><ref name=\"popmatters_burke\" /> Welch and Rawlings' contributions on Hitchcock's album ''[[Spooked (album)|Spooked]]'' was described by Christopher Bahn of ''[[The A.V.
