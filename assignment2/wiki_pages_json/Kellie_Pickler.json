During periods when her father, Bo, was incarcerated, she would live with her grandparents outside Albemarle, {{convert|45|mi}} northeast of [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]]. In 1992, Pickler's mother returned to Albemarle, but rarely made contact with her. But in March 1995, with Bo Pickler in prison for armed robbery, her mother was granted custody. Pickler was in the fourth grade. In a February 2006 interview with the ''[[Charlotte Observer]]'', Pickler said: \"She got custody of me for two years... During that time, she was physically and mentally abusive of me.\" In a 1997 court filing, Pickler's grandparents said that her mother had moved to [[Union County, North Carolina|Union County]] with her and treated her harshly. The court restored custody to the grandparents. Her mother vanished again. Her father, whom she describes as an alcoholic and [[drug addict]], served a three-year-nine-month prison sentence at [[Florida State Prison]] for [[aggravated assault]] and [[battery (crime)|battery]] stemming from a 2003 stabbing incident.<ref>[http://www.charlotte.com/mld/charlotte/entertainment/television/13893587.htm 'American Idol's' Pickler: Singer and survivor], [[Charlotte Observer]], February 17, 2006.
