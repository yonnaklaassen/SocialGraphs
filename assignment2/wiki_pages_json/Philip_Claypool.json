His highest-charting single was a cover of [[Bad Company]]'s 1975 hit \"Feel Like Makin' Love.\"\n\n==Biography==\nPhilip Claypool was born and raised in [[Memphis, Tennessee]].<ref name=\"oldies\">{{cite web |url=http://www.oldies.com/artist-biography/Philip-Claypool.html |title=Philip Claypool biography |accessdate=July 31, 2008 |work=oldies.com}}</ref> His mother, a church organist, influenced him to take interest in [[gospel music]].<ref name=\"oldies\"/> By the time he was in high school, Claypool had begun writing songs as well, and by age 21, he had made his first professional performance.<ref name=\"modern\">{{cite journal |last=Rutkoski |first=Rick |date=August 1996 |title=Philip Claypool: Left of Center |journal=Modern Screen's Country Music |volume=90 |issue=6 |pages=46&ndash;47 }}</ref>\n\nBy 1995, Claypool had signed to [[Curb Records]] as a recording artist.<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p169638/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Philip Claypool biography |accessdate=July 31, 2008 |last=Ankeny |first=Jason |work=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> Working with producer [[Jerry Crutchfield]], he released his debut album ''A Circus Leaving Town'' that same year. This album produced four chart singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Hot Country Singles & Tracks charts (now [[Hot Country Songs]]). Among these were the title track (which was later recorded by [[Travis Tritt]] on his 2004 album ''[[My Honky Tonk History]]'') and Claypool's highest-charting hit, a cover of British band [[Bad Company]]'s 1975 single \"Feel Like Makin' Love\".<ref name=\"cst\"/>\n\nClaypool's debut album received a three-star rating from [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] of [[Allmusic]], who called it \"a diverse collection [b]uilding on a solid contemporary base\", with \"intriguing\" production that \"sav[ed] even the weakest tracks\".<ref>{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r229251|pure_url=yes}} |title=A Circus Leaving Town &mdash; Overview |accessdate=July 31, 2008 |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |work=Allmusic}}</ref> Dan Kuchar of ''[[Country Standard Time]]'' noted Claypool's \"leather and velvet\" voice but said that, except for the Bad Company cover and one other song, the material was largely \"tired, cliché-laden… [and] devoid of any hooks\".<ref name=\"cst\">{{cite web |url=http://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/cdreview.asp?xid=3460 |title=A Circus Leaving Town |accessdate=July 31, 2008 |last=Kuchar |first=Dan |work=Country Standard Time}}</ref> Claypool himself described the album as being \"left of center\". In a 1996 interview with ''Modern Screen's Country Music'' magazine, he called it \"more mature\" but \"a little distanced from what is happening radio-wise\".<ref name=\"modern\"/>\n\nClaypool also recorded a song for the soundtrack to the 1998 film ''[[Major League: Back to the Minors]]'' His self-produced second album, ''Perfect World'', was released in 1999,<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> although it contained no chart singles and mostly comprised material from his first album. In late 2012, Claypool recorded his first album in over a decade. Scheduled to be released in 2013, it was produced by Michael Lloyd. The first single from the album, \"I'm Gonna Lie\", was released on March 18, 2013.\n\nClaypool is now the resident musician at Southend Brewery and Smokehouse in Charleston, South Carolina, home of the Big Pig and celebrity chef Orlando Barrera.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://southendbrewery.com/event-space/music-calendar/ | title=Southend Best Restaurant Charleston SC &#124; Dining &#124; Bar &#124; Brewery Downtown }}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:14em;\"| Title\n! style=\"width:18em;\"| Album details\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''A Circus Leaving Town''\n| \n* Release date: November 21, 1995\n* Label: [[Curb Records]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Perfect World''\n| \n* Release date: July 6, 1999\n* Label: Curb Records\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Come On Back Home''\n| \n* Release date: June 19, 2014\n* Label: Heyday Records\n|}\n\n===Singles===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Year\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:20em;\"| Single\n! colspan=\"1\"| Peak positions\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Album\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n! width=\"65\"| [[Hot Country Songs|US Country]]<br /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://mikecurb.com/about/pdf/billboard_charted_singles.pdf |title=Billboard charted singles (page 12) |accessdate=August 6, 2008 |work=Mike Curb.com}}</ref>\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 1995\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Swingin' on My Baby's Chain\"\n| 71\n| align=\"left\" rowspan=\"4\"| ''A Circus Leaving Town''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"[[Feel Like Makin' Love (Bad Company song)|Feel Like Makin' Love]]\"\n| 60\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 1996\n! scope=\"row\"| \"The Strength of a Woman\"\n| 73\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Circus Leaving Town\"\n| 70\n|-\n| 1998\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Looking Up from a Long Way Down\"\n| —\n| align=\"left\"| ''[[Major League: Back to the Minors]]'' <small>(soundtrack)</small>\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 2013\n! scope=\"row\"| \"I'm Gonna Lie\"\n| —\n| align=\"left\" rowspan=\"4\"| ''Come On Back Home''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Strong One\"\n| —\n|-\n| 2014\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Come On Back Home\"\n| —\n|-\n| 2015\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Three More Beers\"\n| —\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" style=\"font-size:8pt\"| \"—\" denotes releases that did not chart\n|-\n|}\n\n===Music videos===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n!
