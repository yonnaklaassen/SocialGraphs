She won a record breaking seven [[Golden Guitar]] awards in the [[Tamworth Country Music Festival]] in January 2004, and as of 2017, she has won 21 in total.<ref name=\"storer by storer\">{{cite web|url=https://www.jbhifi.com.au/products/cd-storer-storer-cd|title=Storer by Storer|website=[[JB Hi-Fi]]|access-date=17 December 2022}}</ref> Three of her six studio albums have reached the top&nbsp;30 on the [[ARIA Charts|ARIA Albums Chart]], ''[[Firefly (Sara Storer album)|Firefly]]'' (July 2005), ''[[Lovegrass (album)|Lovegrass]]'' (August 2013) and ''[[Silos (album)|Silos]]'' (March 2016).

Storer has been a member of a country music trio, [[Songbirds (group)|Songbirds]] (2007–09) alongside [[Beccy Cole]] and [[Gina Jeffries]]. Her older brother, [[Greg Storer]], is also a country music singer-songwriter and the siblings have recorded and performed together.\n\n==Early career==\nSara Bettine Storer was born in October 1973 in [[Wemen, Victoria|Wemen]] where her parents, Lindsay and Fay<!-- maiden name not seen in sources --> Storer, farmed wheat and cattle on a {{convert|5000|acre|ha}} property.<ref name=\"APRA Buffalo\"/><ref name=\"Dawson\"/> Her three brothers, including Doug and [[Greg Storer]], became farmers, she also has two older sisters.<ref name=\"Dawson\"/><ref name=\"Fidler inter\"/> She attended school in nearby, [[Robinvale]].<ref name=\"Thorburn\"/>\n\nStorer later recalled, \"I wasn't much of a farmer's daughter. Three brothers – they did everything and they enjoyed it. I would rather sit at home and help out with mum really. I was scared of cattle. I always got yelled at cos I was in the wrong spot you know, didn't really know what I was doing. I was never very good.\"<ref name=\"Fidler inter\"/> She completed her tertiary studies in Melbourne, becoming a teacher and then headed north in the mid-1990s. Living in [[Camooweal, Queensland|Camooweal]], she met a retired [[domestic buffalo|water buffalo]] shooter, Harry Chandler, whose stories inspired her to write, \"Buffalo Bill\", her first song.<ref name=\"APRA Buffalo\"/><ref name=\"Dawson\"/>\n\nNine months later, Storer moved to [[Katherine, Northern Territory]], where she taught kindergarten level at Casuarina Street Primary School.<ref name=\"ABC Bio\"/> After a year there she taught at [[Kalkarindji]] ({{convert|466|km|mi}} southwest of Katherine), for four years.<ref name=\"ABC Bio\"/><ref name=\"AMO Bio\"/> Later she co-wrote and recorded a track, \"Children of the Gurindji\", with [[Kev Carmody]], for her compilation album, ''[[Calling Me Home – The Best of Sara Storer]]'' (April 2010).\n\nCarmody told [[Rhoda Roberts]] of ''Deadly Vibe'', \"[Storer] came up here about 12 months ago and we did a song about the Gurindji kids together. The whole basis of the song was, when she went to teach at Kalkarindji – she taught there for a number of years – she said that she came away with the kids teaching her more than she taught them, and that was the chorus of the song.\"<ref name=\"Roberts\"/>\n\nWhen not teaching she started playing at parties across the territory. She won a talent quest at [[Adelaide River, Northern Territory|Adelaide River]] which provided a scholarship to the College of Country Music, held two weeks before the [[Tamworth Country Music Festival]], in January 2000. There she met [[Garth Porter]], former keyboard player with [[Sherbet (band)|Sherbet]], and a record producer of fellow singers, [[Lee Kernaghan]] and [[Gina Jeffreys]]. Porter worked with Storer to record six tracks which he showcased to [[ABC Music]]'s owners, who agreed to sign her to their label.\n\n==Recording career==\n===2000–2009===\nSara Storer released her debut studio album, ''[[Chasing Buffalo]]'', in August 2000 via ABC Music/[[Universal Music Australia]] with Porter producing. It peaked in the [[ARIA Charts|ARIA Albums Chart]] top&nbsp;100, No.&nbsp;20 on the Australasian Artists, No.&nbsp;8 on the Hitseekers and No.&nbsp;6 on the Country albums charts.<ref name=\"ARIA Report 626\"/> She won the Best New Talent category at the 2001 [[Country Music Awards of Australia]] for her debut single, \"Buffalo Bill\", in January of that year.<ref name=\"CMAoA 2000s\"/>\n\nHer second album, ''[[Beautiful Circle]]'', was released in November 2002, which was produced by Porter again. In January 2004 at the Country Music Awards of Australia she was nominated for eight Golden Guitars, and won seven of them – a then-record number of trophies at one ceremony:<ref name=\"ARIA Report 804\"/><ref name=\"Morris 1\"/> Vocal Collaboration, Single of the Year and Song of the Year all for \"Raining on the Plains\" (with [[John Williamson (singer)|John Williamson]]); Female Vocalist of the Year and Album of the Year for ''Beautiful Circle'', Songwriter of the Year for \"Raining on the Plains\" (co-written with Porter and Greg Storer); Bush Ballad of the Year for \"Boss Drovers Pride\" and Heritage Song of the Year for \"Drover's Call\".<ref name=\"CMAoA 2000s\"/>\n\nThe album reached No.&nbsp;50 on the ARIA Albums Chart in March 2004.<ref name=\"AUS Charts\"/> It also peaked at No.&nbsp;11 on the Australasian Artists, No.&nbsp;1 on the Hitseekers and No.&nbsp;2 on the Country albums charts.<ref name=\"ARIA Report 732\"/> She promoted it by touring with Australian country singer, [[Troy Cassar-Daley]],<ref name=\"Morris 1\"/> and United Kingdom singer, [[Charlie Landsborough]], including playing to an audience of over 40,000 people at the [[Gympie Muster]], Queensland. On 6 October 2004 she issued her first DVD, ''Stories to Tell'', which included music videos, interview footage, acoustic performances and new tracks.<ref name=\"Morris 1\"/>\n\n''[[Firefly (Sara Storer album)|Firefly]]'', was Storer's third album, was released in July 2005, which peaked at No.&nbsp;24 on the ARIA Albums Chart.<ref name=\"ARIA Report 804\"/><ref name=\"AUS Charts\"/> Porter produced the work and it became her first number-one on the ARIA Country Albums Chart.<ref name=\"ARIA Report 804\"/> She co-wrote and recorded duets on three tracks: with Greg (\"Chiller's Bend\"), [[Josh Cunningham]] (\"Important Things\") and [[Paul Kelly (Australian musician)|Paul Kelly]] (\"Must've Been a Hell of a Party\").\n\nKelly described Storer, \"You know she's paid attention, heard the bush waking up in the morning, listened to the worries thrashed out at the kitchen table, smelt dry summer wheat up close, dreamed of far away places in a bedroom with a window on a big sky, driven miles on dirt and bitumen and fallen in and out of love. She's found her own way to sing the stories that are all around her and then inside her bubbling out. She doesn't copy over-emotive, fake sincere twangy country singers from overseas. She's found her own restraint and steel and lets her songs do their sweet, sly work.\"<ref name=\"ABC Bio\"/>\n\nIn December 2005 [[Deborah Conway]] established the Broad Festival project, \"the idea that I would pull these different women performers together from different genres and call it Broad\".<ref name=\"Elliott\"/> Storer joined Conway, [[Katie Noonan]], [[Ruby Hunter]] and [[Clare Bowditch]] where they performed their own and each other's songs on an Australian tour.<ref name=\"Elliott\"/><ref name=\"Broad2005\"/> Conway observed, \"Sara you're a gorgeous surprise package, quiet and unassuming offstage; onstage, you had us pissing ourselves every night. I love that simple yet deceptive guitar playing and those haunting songs, which have such a piercing truth to them.\"<ref name=\"Broad2005\"/>\n\nIn March 2006 Storer played at the Queens' Lunch during the [[2006 Commonwealth Games|Melbourne Commonwealth Games]]. In February and March 2007 she performed a double-headlining tour with fellow country musician, [[Felicity Urquhart]].<ref name=\"Morris 1\"/> In November of that year she released her fourth studio album, ''[[Silver Skies]]'', which reached the ARIA Albums Chart top&nbsp;100 and No.&nbsp;3 on the Country Albums Chart.<ref name=\"AUS Charts\"/> It was co-produced by Cunningham and Matt Fell for her new label, [[EMI Records]].<ref name=\"AUS Charts\"/><ref name=\"Dawson 3\"/>\n\nIts lead single, \"Land Cries Out\", was released in September 2007, which Andrew Tijs of ''Undercover News'' described, \"an achingly beautiful rumination on the bitterness of being forced to leave the land you love – an all too common scenario during the recent drought. With this heartfelt subject matter, Storer has branched away from traditional country sounds... [she] uses electric guitar and drums to complement the lament.\"<ref name=\"Tijs 2\"/> From late January to early February 2008 she supported a tour by American singer-songwriter, [[Suzanne Vega]].<ref name=\"Tijs\"/>\n\nFrom 2007 to 2009 she joined [[Beccy Cole]] and [[Gina Jeffreys]] to form a country music trio, [[Songbirds (group)|Songbirds]].<ref name=\"Morris 1\"/> The group released a live DVD, ''You've Got a Friend: Live in Concert'', on 1 May 2009, which was accredited by [[Australian Recording Industry Association|ARIA]] as a gold album by the end of that year.<ref name=\"ARIA Acred 09\"/> It was recorded at Tamworth in January 2009.<ref name=\"Dawson 2\"/> It was shown at cinemas from 29 April of that year, Storer opined, \"I'm really proud of the Songbirds: You've Got a Friend live filming but am worried how pregnant I will look shown on a big screen.\"<ref name=\"Cashmere 1\"/>\n\nStorer had encouraged her brother Greg, a cropping farmer from \"Strawin\" {{convert|60|km|mi}} north-west of [[Warren, New South Wales]], to write music, she has performed his work, including duets with him and she is recorded on his debut single, \"When I Was a Boy\" (December 2009).<ref name=\"Land Warren\"/> He recalled, \"Sara started off telling me to write some lyrics and then every now and then she said I should get up and have a sing at one of her shows. It was absolutely terrifying to get up and sing in front of some great artists... [its] a bit addictive. The trick is to never put the guitar away – in between wrestling with the kids or doing something else, I can just pick up the guitar.\"<ref name=\"Land Warren\"/>\n\n===2010–2020===\nIn April 2010, Storer released her first compilation album, ''Calling Me Home – The Best of Sara Storer'', which reached No.&nbsp;28 on the ARIA Albums Chart and No.&nbsp;1 on the Country Albums Chart.<ref name=\"AUS Charts\"/> She had recorded three new tracks, \"Calling Me Home\", \"Children of the Gurundi\" (with Kev Carmody) and \"Tears\". At the [[ARIA Music Awards of 2010]] John Williamson was inducted into their [[ARIA Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] in October, where Storer performed his tune, \"Mallee Boy\", in his honour.<ref name=\"Ferris\"/>\n\nThe singer-songwriter launched her fifth album, ''[[Lovegrass (album)|Lovegrass]]'', at the [[Gympie Music Muster]] in August 2013.<ref name=\"Hamley\"/> She explained her preparation, \"I'm getting there early and we're all going to catch up prior to the Muster for a rehearsal, which is a must especially when I'm releasing a new album and playing the songs with the band for the first time, really. We need a little practice run otherwise we could end up a train smash.\"<ref name=\"Hamley\"/> ''Lovegrass'', which was produced by Matt Fell, peaked at No.&nbsp;25 on the ARIA Albums Chart and No.&nbsp;5 on the Country Albums Chart.<ref name=\"AUS Charts\"/> In 2015 Storer recorded \"Song for Grace\", a duet with Lee Kernaghan for his album, ''[[Spirit of the Anzacs (album)|Spirit of the Anzacs]]'' (March 2015).\n\nIn March 2016 Storer released her sixth studio album, ''[[Silos (album)|Silos]]'', also produced by Fell, which peaked at No.&nbsp;30 on the ARIA Albums Chart and No.&nbsp;3 on the Country Music Albums Chart.<ref name=\"AUS Charts\"/> It earned the musician her sixth nomination for [[ARIA Award for Best Country Album]] and her first win in the category, at [[ARIA Music Awards of 2016|that year's]] ceremony.<ref name=\"ARIA List\"/> At the Country Music Awards of Australia in January 2017 she received her 21st Golden Guitar – the most by any female artist.<ref name=\"CMAoA 2010s\"/><ref name=\"Young\"/>\n\nIn April 2019, Storer released her 7th studio album, ''[[Raindance (Sara Storer album)|Raindance]]''.\n\n===2020–present===\nIn January 2023, Sara will feature on the self-titled album by Storer, alongside her brother Greg and Greg's daughters Bonnie & Pip.<ref name=\"storer by storer\"/>\n\n== Personal life==\nWhen Sara Storer was 18, her parents moved from Wemen, Victoria to a farming property near Warren, New South Wales.<ref name=\"Dawson 2\"/><ref name=\"OSullivan\"/> Storer had lived in Melbourne, moved to Camooweal, North Queensland and then to Katherine and Kalkarindji, Northern Territory in the mid-1990s.
