In 1996, they recorded in the US under the name Siberian Heatwave and were guests on ''Prime Time Country'' on the Nashville Network. The band dissolved in late May 2006, but the  announcement was not made until June 1, 2006. At the time of its dissolution, the band comprised five musicians: Alexander Arzamastsev (drums), Natasha Borzilova (lead vocals, acoustic guitar), Sergei \"Spooky\" Olkhovsky (bass), Alexander \"Sasha\" Ostrovsky (dobro, steel guitar, lap steel), and Lydia Salnikova (lead vocals, keyboards).\n\nIlya Toshinsky played electric guitar, acoustic guitar, and banjo on the band's first album but left the band after recording the second album.
