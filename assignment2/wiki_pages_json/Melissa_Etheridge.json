While on the road promoting the album, she paused in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], to be interviewed for the syndicated radio program ''Pulsebeat—Voice of the Heartland'', explaining the intensity of her music by saying: \"People think I'm really sad—or really angry.

Similar to her prior two albums, ''Never Enough'' didn't reach the top of the charts peaking at #21 but gave Etheridge her first Grammy for [[Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance|Best Rock Vocal Performance, Female]] for her single \"Ain't It Heavy\". ''Never Enough'' was considered a more personal and mature album from Etheridge at that time.
