His soft-spoken singing voice was given the nickname \"Whispering Bill\" by music critics and writers.<ref name=\"Allmusic Bio\"/> As a songwriter, his compositions have been covered by various music artists since the late 1950s, including [[Ray Price (musician)|Ray Price]] and [[George Strait]].\n\nAnderson was raised in [[Decatur, Georgia]], and began composing songs while in high school. While enrolled in college, he wrote the song \"[[City Lights (Ray Price song)|City Lights]]\", which later became a major hit for Ray Price in 1958. His songwriting led to his first recording contract with [[Decca Records]] the same year. Anderson began having major hits shortly thereafter. In 1963, he had released his most successful single in his recording career, \"[[Still (Bill Anderson song)|Still]]\". The song became a major country pop [[crossover music|crossover]] hit and was followed by a series of top ten hits. These songs included \"[[I Love You Drops (song)|I Love You Drops]]\", \"[[I Get the Fever]]\" and  \"[[Wild Week-End]]\". His songs were being notably recorded by other artists. In 1964, [[Connie Smith]] had her first major hit with his composition \"[[Once a Day]]\". In 1971, [[Cal Smith]] had a number one single with Anderson's \"[[The Lord Knows I'm Drinking]]\".\n\nIn the 1970s, Anderson continued having major hits as a recording artist as well. Songs including \"[[Love Is a Sometimes Thing]]\", \"[[All the Lonely Women in the World]]\" and \"[[World of Make Believe]]\" became major hits. As the decade progressed his style moved towards the polished [[countrypolitan]] genre of country music, with songs such as \"[[I Can't Wait Any Longer]]\". He was dropped from his record label in the early 1980s and began a brief career in television which included hosting the game shows ''[[The Better Sex]]'' and ''[[Fandango (game show)|Fandango]].'' Anderson began writing songs again in the early 1990s for the next generation of country performers. Collaborating with other writers, he wrote material that went on to become hits for [[Vince Gill]], [[George Strait]], [[Kenny Chesney]], and [[Steve Wariner]] in the next two decades.\n\nAnderson also continued recording into the 1990s. In 1998, he released his first major label album in over a decade, entitled ''[[Fine Wine (Bill Anderson album)|Fine Wine]].'' He continued releasing music through his own TWI record label. This included projects of gospel and bluegrass material. His most recent studio album was released in 2020. In his career as both a writer and performer, he has received awards from the [[Academy of Country Music]], [[Country Music Association]], [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] and the [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]].\n\n==Early life==\nAnderson was born James William Anderson III to Elizabeth and James William Anderson Jr. in [[Columbia, South Carolina]]. He was the oldest of two children. His sister, Elizabeth Anderson, was born two years after. Anderson's father was an [[insurance broker|insurance agent]] while his mother was a homemaker. He spent his early childhood with his family in Columbia.{{sfn|Anderson, Bill|Cooper, Peter|2016|p=9}} The family moved to his grandparents' home in [[Griffin, Georgia]], while Anderson was in the third grade. Shortly afterward, the family relocated into their own home in [[Decatur, Georgia]], where he spent the remainder of his childhood.{{sfn|Anderson, Bill|Cooper, Peter|2016|pp=15–16}} In Decatur, his father opened his own insurance agency firm, which he continued to own until his retirement. In his 2016 autobiography, Anderson described his childhood as \"average\", recalling that he \"never went to bed hungry\" even though the family did not have many material possessions.{{sfn|Anderson, Bill|Cooper, Peter|2016|pp=16–17}} \n[[File:UGASLC.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Anderson briefly attended the [[University of Georgia]] in the late 1950s, where he studied journalism.]]\n\nIn school, Anderson was active in [[4-H]] organizations and played both baseball and football.{{sfn|Anderson, Bill|Cooper, Peter|2016|p=16}} However, he was most interested in music, having been inspired by his grandparents who played instruments.<ref name=\"PBS\">{{cite web |last1=Burns |first1=Ken |title=Country Music: Bill Anderson Biography |url=https://www.pbs.org/kenburns/country-music/bill-anderson-biography |website=[[PBS]] |access-date=August 6, 2020}}</ref> His interest grew further after watching country musicians perform on a radio station, located directly above his father's insurance company.{{sfn|Anderson, Bill|Cooper, Peter|2016|pp=17–19}} Anderson soon saved enough money to purchase his own guitar. At age ten, he wrote his first song called \"Carry Me Home Texas\".<ref name=\"PBS\"/>\n\nIn high school, Anderson and his friends formed their own band and won a school talent contest. The band began performing around the local area, eventually performing on local radio as \"The Avondale Playboys\".{{sfn|Anderson, Bill|Cooper, Peter|2016|pp=19–22}} Anderson's strong interest in baseball continued through high school as well. He became his high school team's pitcher and was scouted to go to the [[Chicago Cubs]] training camp. However, Anderson declined the offer after realizing that his family would be upset if he did not attend college.{{sfn|Anderson, Bill|Cooper, Peter|2016|pp=22–23}} Upon graduating high school, he enrolled at the [[University of Georgia]] and majored in [[journalism]].<ref name=\"PBS\"/>\n\nAnderson had dabbled with journalism before enrolling in university. While still in high school, he wrote for his school's newspaper and also obtained a job covering sports events for ''[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]].''{{sfn|Anderson, Bill|Cooper, Peter|2016|p=27}} In his freshman year, he pledged the [[Kappa Sigma Fraternity]].{{sfn|Anderson, Bill|Cooper, Peter|2016|p=28}} He and several students formed a country band called the \"Classic City Playboys\" and began playing local events. He also became interested in radio station work after a DJ friend introduced him to some of the controls. \"I thought I was Superman. I knew that night I had to get a job as a disc jockey\", he recalled.{{sfn|Anderson, Bill|Cooper, Peter|2016|p=32}}\n\nAnderson graduated from college in 1959.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bill Anderson papers and records |url=https://sclfind.libs.uga.edu/sclfind/view?docId=ead/ms3941.xml |website=[[University of Georgia]] |access-date=24 April 2022}}</ref> During his first summer out of college, he got a job working as a rock and roll DJ at [[WGAU]] in [[Athens, Georgia]]. However, he was fired after playing country records over the air and was then hired at [[WJJC]] in [[Commerce, Georgia]]. Anderson began songwriting again after obtaining the new position. In Commerce, Anderson wrote the song \"[[City Lights (Ray Price song)|City Lights]]\". The song ultimately brought him to Nashville where both his songwriting and recording career began.<ref name=\"PBS\"/>\n\n==Recording career==\n===1958–1962: Early success===\nAnderson's own recording career began in 1957 after releasing two singles for the independent label, TNT. Both songs (including his own version of \"City Lights\") attracted little attention.{{sfn|Anderson, Bill|Cooper, Peter|2016|pp=46–47}} However, the success brought by Ray Price's version of \"City Lights\" led Anderson to frequent [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. In the city, he brought compositions for artists and producers to record. [[Owen Bradley]] of [[Decca Records]] was impressed by Anderson's writing and decided to sign him as a recording artist to the label. Anderson officially signed with Decca in the summer of 1958.<ref name=\"PBS\"/> His early Decca singles were entirely self-composed.

However, several individual restaurants encountered financial struggles, which resulted in legal fees that Anderson had to pay. In addition, the company was being bought out by the larger [[Krystal (restaurant)|Krystal]] fast-food chain. He was forced to pay back fees he owed towards the company, nearly causing Anderson to declare [[bankruptcy]]. However, with the support of Twitty, Anderson helped pay off the company's financial entanglements. \"Even as it stood, my little foray into the restaurant business wiped out a large chunk of my life's savings\", he later said.{{sfn|Anderson, Bill|Cooper, Peter|2016|pp=217–20}}\n\n==Personal life==\nAnderson has been married twice and has had two documented long-term relationships.

The couple remained married for ten years. Bette gave birth to two daughters during their relationship together.{{sfn|Anderson, Bill|Cooper, Peter|2016|pp=70–71}} Bette also contributed to her husband's writing career when she co-wrote the 1965 song, \"[[I Can't Remember]]\".

She highlighted 2004's \"Whiskey Lullaby\" as an example. In reviewing the song, Konc commented that it was \"packed full of unforgettable images\" related to \"heartbreak, addiction and loss\".
