He is best known for his narrative tales of love, life, and death in America.  In 2003, he was among the winners of the New Folk competition at the [[Kerrville Folk Festival]].  He set a record for CD sales at the festival that year, making more sales than the main stage acts.  His song, \"The Ballad of Larry\" has been listed a \"Top Rated Song\" by Americana-UK.  He primarily performs solo and accompanies himself in a variety of traditional acoustic guitar styles.  His recordings have featured a variety of instrumental ensembles and typically include one or more [[instrumental]] tracks that feature Byrd's skillful [[flatpicking]] technique.  Occasionally he also appears with the [[Athens, Georgia]] based [[world music]] duo, [[Dromedary (band)|Dromedary]].\n\nJonathan Byrd teamed up with Chris Kokesh after meeting her at the Americana Song Academy and the duo released a self-titled album under the name The Barn Birds in 2013.<ref>from an interview on [http://americanamusicshow.com/episode164 episode 164 of the Americana Music Show], released November 4, 2013</ref>\n\nIn 2014, Byrd released You Can't Outrun The Radio, a collection of songs inspired by an impromptu song circle in 2009 at the Green Room in Montreal.<ref>from an interview published on [http://americanamusicshow.com/episode223 episode 223 of the Americana Music Show], released December 8, 2014</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Albums===\n*''[[Wildflowers (Jonathan Byrd album)|Wildflowers]]'' (2001, [[Waterbug Records]])\n*''[[The Waitress]]'' (2002, Waterbug Records)\n*''[[The Sea and The Sky]]'', with [[Dromedary (band)|Dromedary]] (2004, Waterbug Records)\n*''[[This Is The New That]]'' (March 2007, Waterbug Records)\n*''[[Radio Soul]]'', with [[Diana Jones (singer-songwriter)|Diana Jones]] (May 2007)\n*''[[The Law and the Lonesome]]'' (May 2008, Waterbug Records)\n*''[[Cackalack]]'' (November 2010, Waterbug Records)\n*''[[The Barn Birds]]'' (July 2013, Waterbug Records)\n*''[[You Can't Outrun The Radio]]'' (November 2014, Waterbug Records)\n*''[[Mother Tongue (Jonathan Byrd album)|Mother Tongue]]'', with [[The Sentimentals]] (February 2015)\n*''[[Jonathan Byrd & The Pickup Cowboys]]'' (November 2018)\n\n===Other recordings===\n*\"You Better Keep An Eye On Him\", with Dromedary on ''[[Vote in November: Election 2004 Anti-Theft Device]]'' ([[Waterbug Records|Waterbug]] compilation, 2004)\n*\"Breathless\" on ''[[Waterbug Anthology 8: Born into the Whisper]]'' (Waterbug compilation, 2006)\n*''Live at the Saxon Pub'', with [[Greg Klyma]] (download of live show, 2006)\n* \"Cut 'em Down\", a song by Byrd, recorded by Mission Street Project for ''Liberty Tree: Songs from the American Kitchen, Vol. 1'' (2006, Hudson Harding)\n* \"White Cloud\", a song by Byrd recorded by Karen Mal for ''The Space Between'' (2007, Waterbug); Mal and Byrd also co-wrote the album's title track.\n\n==Further reading==\n*Eshleman, Annette C., \"Linen Lites: Jonathan Byrd – Learning the Rules ... and Breaking Them\", ''[[Dirty Linen (magazine)|Dirty Linen]]'', '''119''', August–September 2005, p.&nbsp;12–13\n*Watroba, Matt, [https://web.archive.org/web/20110516170259/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-121536225.html \"Jonathan Byrd & Dromedary: forces of nature\"], ''[[Sing Out!]]'', '''48:3''', Fall 2004, p.&nbsp;20–23 (link requires subscription to highbeam.com)\n*Wood, Arthur, [https://web.archive.org/web/20110717224523/http://www.visnat.com/entertainment/music/folkwax/mp3/bio.cfm?artistnumber=1078 \"Born into the Whisper\" (Jonathan Byrd bio)], ''FolkWax'' (link requires free subscription)\n*Grant, Rick, [http://www.eujacksonville.com/pages/04-08/jonathanbyrd.htm \"Catchy Songs with True Grit\"], ''EU Jacksonville'', March 2008\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.jonathanbyrd.com  Jonathan Byrd], official homepage\n*[http://waterbug.com/catalog/index.php?cPath=25&osCsid=7f76b71a169c734ce2f1c2ec36565357 Jonathan Byrd] at [[Waterbug Records]]\n*[http://www.myspace.com/jonathanbyrd Jonathan Byrd] at [[MySpace]]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/profile?user=jonathanbyrd Jonathan Byrd] at YouTube\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20081204095623/http://www.fishrecords.co.uk/reviews/theseaandthesky.htm Album review] at Fishrecords\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Byrd, Jonathan}}\n[[Category:1970 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:American country singer-songwriters]]\n[[Category:American folk musicians]]\n[[Category:Musicians from Fayetteville, North Carolina]]\n[[Category:People from Carrboro, North Carolina]]\n[[Category:Singer-songwriters from North Carolina]]\n[[Category:21st-century American singer-songwriters]]\n[[Category:Country musicians from North Carolina]]\n[[Category:Waterbug Records artists]]"
