She is the lead vocalist for the country band [[the Chicks]].\n\nIn 1995, after leaving [[Berklee College of Music]], Maines was recruited by the Dixie Chicks to replace their lead singer, Laura Lynch. With Maines as lead vocalist, the band earned 10 [[Country Music Association Awards]] and 13 [[Grammy Award]]s for their work between 1998 and 2007.\n\nIn 2006, with Maines still acting as lead singer, the Dixie Chicks released ''[[Taking the Long Way]]''. The album subsequently won five [[Grammy Awards]] (including [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]]). After dropping the \"Dixie\", the Chicks new album ''[[Gaslighter (album)|Gaslighter]]'' was released on July 17, 2020. As a solo artist, Maines released the album, ''[[Mother (Natalie Maines album)|Mother]]'', on May 7, 2013.\n\n== Early life ==\nMaines was born in [[Lubbock, Texas]], to country musician and producer [[Lloyd Maines]] and Tina May Maines. She attended Nat Williams Elementary School in Lubbock, where her second grade teacher recalls being told by Maines during a math lesson, \"Teacher, I don't need to learn this stuff—I'm gonna be a star.\"<ref name=\"Dickerson\" /> Maines was a cheerleader while attending O.

My parents sent me and my sister to public minority schools so I always felt like a hippie and a rebel. ... As a teenager I always loved not thinking in the way I knew the majority of people thought. I always stood up for minorities. ... I've always stood up for homosexuals. I just always had these really strong convictions about doing so.\"<ref name=\"Heysen\">Heysen, Kristen.

She spent two semesters pursuing an undeclared major at [[West Texas A&M University|West Texas A&M]] where her studies focused heavily on radio, then a year and a half at [[South Plains College]]. One of Maines's instructors at South Plains, and a former member of [[The Maines Brothers Band]], Cary Banks, recalled \"She was mostly into [[rock'n'roll]], [[rhythm and blues]] ... [[alternative rock]].\" When Banks encountered Maines on campus, he said that she usually needed to vent a little steam. \"She would get into a lot of political arguments\" at the predominantly Republican school, and was a fan of Texas Governor [[Ann Richards]]. \"She's always been opinionated and hardheaded like her dad.\"<ref name=\"Dickerson\" />  In December 1994, Maines auditioned for and received a full vocal scholarship to Berklee College of Music. She pursued the diploma program at Berklee but dropped out before the completion of her studies. Even though Maines is from Lubbock, home of [[Texas Tech University]], she attended only one class at the school, a 1995 summer course in \"Introductory Wildlife\".<ref name=\"Dickerson\" />\n\n== Career ==\nMaines's first professional recording was lead vocals on the song \"White Women's Clothes\" on Andy Wilkinson's album \"Charlie Goodnight's Life in Poetry and Song.\" Maines's first commercially released work was [[backing vocalist|background vocals]] on [[Pat Green]]'s debut album, ''Dancehall Dreamer'', produced by her father Lloyd Maines and released in 1995. At the end of 1995, at age 21, Maines joined the all-female [[country music]] band, the then named [[Dixie Chicks]], which had been performing since 1989, but which had been unsuccessful in gaining more than local attention.
