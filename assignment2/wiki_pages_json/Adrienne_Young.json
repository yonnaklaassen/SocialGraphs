She is founder and operator of AddieBelle Music which produces her recordings.\n\n== History ==\nA native of [[Tallahassee, Florida]], in fact a seventh-generation Floridian, she was raised on the land farmed by her family generations earlier.<ref name=\"adrienneyoung.com\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.adrienneyoung.com/roots |title=Roots - Adrienne Young |access-date=2008-02-27 |archive-date=2008-02-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080222193417/http://www.adrienneyoung.com/roots |url-status=dead }}</ref>  Young grew up in a musical family in [[Clearwater, Florida|Clearwater]], where she was a member of the band [[Big White Undies]].\n\nShe was graduated magna cum laude from [[Belmont University]] in Nashville with a music business/Spanish degree. Endless and unfulfilling clerical jobs along [[Music Row]] motivated this triple-threat singer, writer, and multi-instrumentalist to start her own [[record label]], Addiebelle Music.<ref name=\"adrienneyoung.com\"/> She also formed the short-lived band Liters of Pop with [[Eric McConnell]].\n\nShe learned to play clawhammer-style banjo from Ketch Secor of [[Old Crow Medicine Show]], and set about amassing a catalog of [[old-time music|old-time]] tunes.  As she says:\n\n{{blockquote|I got really into [[traditional music]] when I was longing to connect with my family again, and that led to trying to build up a repertoire that my grandfather was familiar with, the classic [[old-time music|old-time]] and [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] tunes.<ref>[http://www.courant.com/ \"Adrienne Young's Activism Keeps Her In Tune\"] by Eric R. Danton, Courant Rock Critic, August 17, 2007 [[Hartford Courant]].</ref>}}\n\nYoung began gaining attention with her 2003 win in the Chris Austin songwriting contest at [[MerleFest]] for \"Sadie's Song\".  Co-written with [[Mark D. Sanders]], the song is a re-telling of the murderous bluegrass standard \"[[Little Sadie]]\" told from the victim's point of view.\n\n== Recordings ==\n\"[[Little Sadie]]\" featured prominently on her first [[CD]], ''[[Plow to the End of the Row]]'', produced with another [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]-based musician, [[Will Kimbrough]], and released on her own [[AddieBelle]] [[record label]].  (The label takes its name from a nickname Young was given while working as a tour guide at Nashville's [[Belle Meade Mansion]].)  The [[CD]], which includes a packet of wildflower seeds along with artwork based on the ''[[Farmers' Almanac]]'', was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] for Best Album Package.\n\nAn early version of ''Plow to the End of the Row'', released in 2003, has become a sought-after collectible.  That version included several tracks with Young backed by [[Old Crow Medicine Show]] and was a top pick for 2003 Debut Artist by the Freeform American Roots DJ Chart.  The nationally-released version, featuring different sequencing, new tracks, and re-recorded versions of several songs, was released on April 13, 2004, one day before an interview with Young aired on [[NPR]]'s ''[[All Things Considered]]''.  The [[Americana Music Association]] included Young and her band in their nominees for Emerging Artist of the Year, and the ''[[Nashville Scene]]'' named \"Home Remedy\" as Best Country Single of the year.  The CD went on to place at or near the top of numerous \"best of\" lists for the year and the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called Young \"the [[Americana (music)|Americana]] music find of the year.\"\n\n[[Image:Adrienne Young Andy Thacker Little Sadie Little Grill Collective Harrisonburg VA June 2008.jpg|left|thumb|250px|With Andy Thacker of Little Sadie<br>[[Little Grill Collective]], June 27, 2008.]]\nYoung and her band Little Sadie (at the time, Tyler Grant on guitar, Clayton Campbell on fiddle and mandolin, Amanda Kowalski on bass, and Steven Sandifer on percussion) toured extensively across the U.S. and in England.  The members of the band left to pursue other projects prior to the recording of Young's second CD, ''[[The Art of Virtue]]''.\n\nThat disc, released on June 28, 2005, took its theme from [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s ''[[Benjamin Franklin#Thirteen Virtues|Thirteen Virtues]]''.  A copy of Franklin's pamphlet is included with the CD.  Will Kimbrough co-produced the CD and co-wrote several tracks.  Alongside original songs and traditional tunes, the disc featured a cover of the [[Grateful Dead]] song \"Brokedown Palace\".  Young's AddieBelle label struck a distribution deal with [[Ryko Records]] which insured that her music got placed in more record stores.  She also continued to receive support from [[public radio]] and was invited to appear on ''[[World Cafe (radio program)|World Cafe]]'', ''[[Mountain Stage]]'', and ''[[A Prairie Home Companion]]''.  With a new incarnation of Little Sadie (fiddler and banjoist Eric Merrill, guitarist Hans Holzen, bassist Kyle Kegerreis, and percussionist Eric Platz), Young toured even more extensively in 2005.\n\n''The Art of Virtue'' placed third in [[Amazon.com]]'s list of the best folk recordings of the year.  Young was invited to sing in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] on January 17, 2006, as part of Benjamin Franklin's 300th birthday celebration.\n\nIn May 2006, Young took her band to [[Levon Helm]]'s studio in [[Woodstock, New York]] to record tracks for a third album, titled ''[[Room to Grow (album)|Room to Grow]],'' which was released May 22, 2007.\n\n== Social and environmental action ==\nYoung's second CD, ''[[The Art of Virtue]]'' released in 2005, took its theme from [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s ''Thirteen Virtues'' and included copy of Franklin's pamphlet inside.  The title track addressed issues that Young found herself pondering after the 2004 re-election of [[George W. Bush]], specifically how the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] had leveraged the theme of [[morality]] as a [[Political campaign|campaign]] tool.  As she said at the time:\n\n{{blockquote|There seems to be a growing passion, collectively and individually, to understand the foundation of our American culture and how we've turned from that. Personally, it steered me back toward a time when our country was rooted in agrarian ideals and words were powerful enough to begin a new world.  Ben Franklin had such a practical approach toward nurturing virtue, the first point being nobody's perfect.}}\n\nSince 2004 Young has been a spokeswoman for the [[FoodRoutes Network]], which aims to aid organizations in rebuilding local, community-based food systems.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://girlcooksworld.com/|title=Girl Cooks World - Global Cuisine, Cooking Tips, Must-haves & Ideas|website=Girlcooksworld.com|access-date=20 April 2023}}</ref>  Young used the release of the [[CD]] ''[[The Art of Virtue]]'' to call attention to her involvement with the FoodRoutes Network, a non-profit organization that promotes [[sustainable agriculture]] and connects consumers with local farmers who are willing to sell direct.  ''[[Room to Grow (album)|Room to Grow]]'' furthers her involvement in this movement with lyrics and songs directly addressing the issue.\n\n<blockquote>This wasn't the first time she mixed her farm action fever with artistic output: ''Plow to the End of the Row'', her 2004 debut CD, came with a packet of seeds enclosed (and was nominated for the packaging design Grammy).</blockquote>\n\nYoung advocates locally-grown and [[sustainable agriculture]]. A portion of each record sold of ''[[Room to Grow (album)|Room to Grow]]'' goes to the Save A Seed fund, which she created with nonprofit organizations the [[FoodRoutes Network]] and the [[American Community Gardening Association]]. The money will provide non-genetically modified seeds to community gardens across North America.\n\nYoung has toured with help from the organization Buy Fresh Buy Local and each of the 49 FoodRoutes chapters. Along with her performances, each tour stop offered [[sustainable living]] workshops with local sponsors in each community. \"Preserving cultural genetics and agricultural heritage is the key to true security and self-reliance\", she says.\n\nYoung says her music has influenced her activism because she feels at peace in nature and wants to communicate those feelings through her music.\n\nAs of 2010, Adrienne Young has hosted and organized the Backyard Revolution, a group of people sharing and demonstrating unique skills of the past and present to help educate people in self sustainability.  The Backyard Revolution was present at Floyd Fest 9 (2010) and the Heritage Harvest Festival at Thomas Jefferson's Monticello. Demonstrations included: Backyard dairy cow (cow included), hide tanning and bow drill fire-making, home fermentation, historic log cabin construction, arrow fletching, soap making, primitive cooking, edible and medicinal wild plants, and more. See www.backyardrevolution.com for more information.\n\n== Sound and style ==\nHer music, created with various incarnations of her band Little Sadie, blends elements of [[bluegrass music|Bluegrass]], [[country music|country]], [[old-time music]], and [[American folk music]] with a pop sensibility.\n\n{{blockquote|Young's bluegrass chops come through clearly and there's more than enough high-spirited music to get you up and dancing or clapping along, and more than enough substance to keep you reflecting on the lyrics long after the music's done, too.<ref>[http://www.dirtylinen.com review of ''Room to Grow''] August/September 2007 [[Dirty Linen (magazine)|Dirty Linen]].</ref>|review of \"Room to Grow\"|''[[Dirty Linen (magazine)|Dirty Linen]]''}}\n\n<blockquote>. . tightly crafted songs that, like the feel of her home and the flow of her conversation, infuse her love for American tradition with high contemporary energy. Young's vocals mirror weariness and hope on 'Natural Bridge,' cross intimate valleys and climb the emotional peaks of 'Room Enough To Grow,' simmer on the stone-country burner \"High Flyin’ Dream\", yearn to go wherever the current takes her on 'River and a Dirt Road.'<ref name=\"adrienneyoung.com\"/></blockquote>\n\n== Awards and distinctions ==\n*''[[Plow to the End of the Row]]'', her 2004 [[CD]], came with a packet of seeds enclosed and was nominated for the packaging design [[Grammy Awards|Grammy]]\n**An early version of the disc, released on a limited basis in 2003, featured several tracks that were ultimately dropped or re-recorded for the national release in 2004.
