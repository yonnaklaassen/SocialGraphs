Her second album, ''[[I'm Alright (Jo Dee Messina album)|I'm Alright]]'', produced five top-10 country hits between 1998 and 1999, and sold over a million copies in America. Since her debut, six of her singles have peaked at number one on the Billboard country singles chart and five of her albums have received a certification by the RIAA or the [[Canadian Recording Industry Association|CRIA]]. She has sold over 5 million records worldwide.\n\n==Early life==\nJo Dee Marie Messina was born on August 25, 1970, in [[Framingham, Massachusetts]], to Vincent and Mary Messina. Her father, of [[Italian American|Italian]] descent, and mother, of [[Irish American|Irish]] descent, raised her in [[Holliston, Massachusetts]], alongside sisters, Terese and Marianne, and a brother, Vincent. At an early age, Messina's love for music blossomed. She drew influence from a variety of country music artists, including [[Patsy Cline]], [[Reba McEntire]], and [[The Judds]]. By age 16, she was playing local clubs, singing while her brother and sister provided backup on drums and guitar.<ref name=allmusic>''Allmusic'' [{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p173934/biography|pure_url=yes}} Jo Dee Messina profile] retrieved 6–26–08</ref>  The group continued performing until Jo Dee graduated from high school.\n\nRealizing that living in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] would limit her chances of achieving country music stardom, Messina moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], at age 19. She worked various temporary jobs, including computer programming and accounting, while entering talent contests around Nashville.\n\nOne win led to a regular gig on the radio show ''Live at Libby's'', which caught the interest of producer [[Byron Gallimore]], who helped her assemble a demonstration tape. Gallimore was also working with the young [[Tim McGraw]] around the same time, and Messina befriended him. Backstage at one of his concerts, McGraw met an executive from his label, [[Curb Records]], and jokingly suggested that they needed a [[red hair|redhead]].<ref name=allmusic/> With the help of fellow Curb producer [[James Stroud]], Messina was soon signed to the record label. Gallimore and McGraw later became co-producers of Messina's studio albums for Curb.\n\n==Music career==\n\n===1996–97: Country success===\n\nMessina released her [[Jo Dee Messina (album)|self-titled debut album]] in 1996. It spawned two top-10 hits, starting with the lead single, \"Heads Carolina, Tails California\", which peaked at number two on the country charts and its follow-up, \"You're Not in Kansas Anymore\" gained similar success.<ref name=allmusic/>\nHowever, the two additional singles released from the album, \"Do You Wanna Make Something of It\" and \"He'd Never Seen Julie Cry\" peaked outside the country top 40 and were minor hits between 1996 and 1997. Following her major success, Messina performed 215 shows in 1996 and became one of the most successful new female vocalists of the 1990s. Her debut album sold over 500,000 copies and was certified gold by the RIAA.\n\nMessina's finances suffered due to a series of poor business decisions and a change of management that led her to nearly declaring [[bankruptcy]]; she nearly lost her home and her car. She spent nearly a year trying to write new songs and material for a new album that could help bring herself out of bankruptcy.<ref name=taylor>Taylor, Chuck (March 13, 1999), \"Curb's Jo Dee Messina Proves She's More Than `Alright' With Hit-Filled Sophomore Set\".

The fourth single, \"[[Lesson in Leavin]]\", was a cover of [[Dottie West]]'s 1980 number-one country hit. The song peaked at number two for seven weeks.  In 1999, she had another top-10 hit from the album, \"[[Because You Love Me]]\", which peaked at number eight on the ''Billboard'' Country Chart.{{citation needed|date=September 2021}}\n\nIn 2000, Messina received the [[Country Music Association]]'s Horizon Award, which is awarded to new country music artists. She also won the ''Billboard'' \"Most Played Female at Country Radio\", and won three major awards from the [[Boston Music Awards]], located in her home state of Massachusetts.\n\nMessina's album became her biggest-selling album to date, selling over two million copies in the US, receiving an RIAA certification of double platinum. She released her third studio album, ''[[Burn (Jo Dee Messina album)|Burn]]'' in 2000, which aimed towards [[country pop]]-styled music.<ref name=allmusic/>  The album's lead single, \"[[That's the Way (Jo Dee Messina song)|That's the Way]]\" peaked at number one on the ''Billboard'' Country Chart and also became her highest-charting single on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, peaking at number 25. Following that success, she had two additional top-10 hits with \"[[Burn (Tina Arena song)|Burn]]\" and \"[[Downtime (Jo Dee Messina song)|Downtime]]\".\n\nMessina had another number-one hit from the album in 2001 with \"[[Bring On the Rain]]\", a duet with Tim McGraw that also became a top-10 hit on the [[Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks|Adult Contemporary Chart]], peaking at number six. In addition to headlining concerts, she also toured with [[Vince Gill]], [[George Strait]], and [[The Judds]]' reunion tour.<ref name=cmt>[https://web.archive.org/web/20040417120438/http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/messina_jo_dee/bio.jhtml Jo Dee Messina profile], cmt.com; accessed September 12, 2021.</ref>\n\nMessina released her first holiday album in 2002 with ''[[A Joyful Noise (Jo Dee Messina album)|A Joyful Noise]]''.
