Between 1951 and 1957, he hosted ''[[The Roy Rogers Show]]'' television series. In many of them, he appeared with his wife, [[Dale Evans]]; his Golden Palomino, [[Trigger (horse)|Trigger]]; and his [[German Shepherd]], Bullet. Rogers is also best remembered for his signature song \"[[Happy Trails (song)|Happy Trails]]\".\n\nHis early roles were uncredited parts in films by fellow singing cowboy [[Gene Autry]].

Alongside [[Bob Hope]], [[Mickey Rooney]], and [[Tony Martin (American singer)|Tony Martin]], he's the recipient of four stars on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]; the latter of which was honored with the band mentioned above.\n\nIn his later years, he lent his name to the franchise chain of [[Roy Rogers Restaurants]].\n\n==Early life==\nRogers was born Leonard Franklin Slye, the son of Mattie (née Womack) and Andrew \"Andy\" Slye in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]].<ref name=\"rr-bio\">{{cite web |last1=Zwisohn |first1=Laurence |title=Happy Trails: The Life of Roy Rogers |url=https://royrogers.com/roy_rogers_bio.html |website=royrogers.com |access-date=11 August 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181205004802/https://royrogers.com/roy_rogers_bio.html |archive-date=December 5, 2018 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The family lived in a tenement on 2nd Street, where [[Riverfront Stadium (Cincinnati)|Riverfront Stadium]] was later constructed. (Rogers later joked that he was born at second base.)<ref name=\"rr-bio\"/> Len had three sisters: Kathleen, Mary, and Cleda. Dissatisfied with his job and city life, Andy and his brother Will built a {{convert|12|x|50|ft|adj=on}} houseboat from salvage lumber, and in July 1912 the Slye family traveled up the [[Ohio River]] towards [[Portsmouth, Ohio|Portsmouth]].<ref name=\"rr-bio\"/> Desiring a more stable existence in Portsmouth, they purchased land on which they planned to build a house, but instead the [[Great Flood of 1913]] enabled them to move the houseboat onto their property and continue living in it on dry land.<ref name=\"rr-bio\"/>\n\n[[File:Roy Rogers Boyhood Home at Duck Run.jpg|thumb|Rogers's boyhood home at Duck Run, near [[Lucasville, Ohio]]]]\nIn 1919, the Slye family purchased a farm in Duck Run, near [[Lucasville, Ohio]], about {{convert|12|mi}} north of Portsmouth, and built a six-room house.<ref name=\"rr-bio\"/> Andy soon realized that the farm alone would not provide sufficient income for his family, so he took a job at a Portsmouth shoe factory, living in Portsmouth during the week and returning home on weekends, bearing gifts following paydays. A notable gift was a horse on which young Len learned the basics of horsemanship.<ref name=\"rr-bio\"/> Living on the farm with no radio, the family made their own entertainment. On Saturday nights, they often invited neighbors over for square dances, during which Len would sing, play mandolin, and call the square dances.<ref name=\"rr-bio\"/> He also learned to [[yodel]] during this time, and with his mother they would use different yodels to communicate with each other across distances on the farm.<ref name=\"rr-bio\"/>\n\nLen attended high school in [[McDermott, Ohio]],<ref name=\"rr-bio\"/> but after he completed his second year there, his family returned to Cincinnati, where his father worked at another shoe factory.<ref name=\"rr-bio\"/> Realizing that his family needed his financial help, Len quit school and joined his father at the factory.<ref name=\"rr-bio\"/> He tried to attend night school, but after being ridiculed for falling asleep in class, he quit school and never returned.\n\nBy 1929, after his older sister Mary and her husband had moved to [[Lawndale, California]], Len and his father quit their factory jobs, packed up their 1923 Dodge, and drove the family to California to visit Mary. They stayed for four months before returning to Ohio.<ref name=\"rr-bio\"/> Soon after returning, Len had the opportunity to travel again to California with Mary's father-in-law, and the rest of the family followed in the spring of 1930. The Slye family rented a small house near Mary, and Len and his father found employment driving gravel trucks for a highway construction project.<ref name=\"rr-bio\"/>\n\nIn spring 1931, after the construction company went bankrupt, Len traveled to [[Tulare, California]], where he found work picking peaches for [[Del Monte Foods|Del Monte]].<ref name=\"rr-bio\"/> During this time, he lived in a labor camp similar to those depicted in John Steinbeck's novel ''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]''.<ref name=\"rr-bio\"/> The economic hardship of the [[Great Depression]] was just as severe in California as it was in Ohio.\n\n==Career==\n===Music career===\nAfter 19-year-old Len's return to Lawndale, his sister Mary suggested that he audition for the ''Midnight Frolic'' radio program, which was broadcast over [[KMCS]] in [[Inglewood, California|Inglewood]]. A few nights later, wearing a Western shirt that Mary had made for him, he overcame his shyness and appeared on the program playing guitar, singing, and yodeling.<ref name=\"rr-bio\"/> A few days later, he was asked to join a local country music group, the Rocky Mountaineers.<ref name=\"rr-bio\"/> He accepted the group's offer and became a member in August 1931.<ref name=\"rr-bio\"/><ref>Green, p. 74.</ref>\n\nBy September 1931, Len hired the Canadian-born [[Bob Nolan]], who answered the group's classified ad in the ''Los Angeles Herald-Examiner'' that read, \"Yodeler for old-time act, to travel.

Throughout that year, Len and Spencer moved through a series of short-lived groups, including the International Cowboys and the O-Bar-O Cowboys. When Spencer left the O-Bar-O Cowboys to take a break from music, Len joined Jack LeFevre and His Texas Outlaws, who were a popular act on a local [[Los Angeles]] radio station.<ref>Green, p. 75.</ref>\n\nIn early 1933, Len, Nolan, and Spencer formed the Pioneers Trio, with Slye on guitar, Nolan on string bass, and Spencer as lead vocalist. They rehearsed for weeks refining their vocal harmonies. During this time, Len continued to work with his radio singing group, while Spencer and Nolan began writing songs for the trio.<ref name=\"cmt\"/> In early 1934, the fiddle player Hugh Farr joined the group, adding a bass voice to their vocal arrangements. Later that year, the Pioneers Trio became the [[Sons of the Pioneers]] when a radio station announcer changed their name because he felt they were too young to be pioneers. The name was received well and fit the group, which was no longer a trio.<ref name=\"cmt\"/>\n\nBy summer 1934, the popularity and fame of the Sons of the Pioneers extended beyond the Los Angeles area and quickly spread across the country through short syndicated radio segments that were later rebroadcast across the United States. The Sons of the Pioneers signed a recording contract with the newly founded [[Decca Records|Decca]] label and made their first commercial recording on August 8, 1934.<ref name=\"cmt\"/> One of the first songs recorded during that first session was \"[[Tumbling Tumbleweeds]]\", written by Bob Nolan. Over the next two years, the Sons of the Pioneers recorded 32 songs for Decca, including the classic \"[[Cool Water (song)|Cool Water]]\".<ref name=\"encyclopedia\">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Sons of the Pioneers |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3430600069.html |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia.com |access-date=August 27, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Film career===\n[[File:Lynne Roberts-Roy Rogers in Billy the Kid Returns.jpg|thumb|Lynne Roberts and Rogers in ''[[Billy the Kid Returns]]'', 1938]]\nFrom his first film appearance in 1935, Len worked steadily in [[Western (genre)|Western]] films, including a large supporting role as a singing cowboy while still billed as Leonard Slye in a Gene Autry movie. In 1938, Autry demanded more money for his work, so there was a competition for a new singing cowboy (that they could pay less). Many singers sought the job, including [[Willie Phelps]] of the Phelps brothers, who appeared in early Western movies. Len ended up winning the contest and was given the stage name Roy Rogers by [[Republic Pictures]], suggesting the western-sounding name Roy and combining it with the surname of the popular western comic entertainer [[Will Rogers]].\n\nHe was assigned the leading role in ''[[Under Western Stars]]''. He became a matinee idol, a competitor with Autry as the nation's favorite [[singing cowboy]]. In addition to his own movies, he played a supporting role in the [[John Wayne]] classic ''[[Dark Command]]'' (1940), which also featured one of his future sidekicks, George \"Gabby\" Hayes. He became a major box-office attraction. Unlike other stars, the vast majority of his leading roles allowed him to play a character with his own name, in the manner of Autry.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001678/|title=Roy Rogers|website=[[IMDb]] }}</ref>\n[[File:Roy Rogers - Hart - 1938.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Publicity photo of Rogers and [[Lynne Roberts|Mary Hart]] for ''[[Shine On, Harvest Moon (1938 film)|Shine On, Harvest Moon]]'', 1938]]\nIn the ''[[Motion Picture Herald]]'' [[Top Ten Money Making Stars Poll#Top Ten Western Stars|Top Ten Money-Making Western Stars]] poll, Rogers was listed for 16 consecutive years, from 1939 to 1954, holding first place from 1943 to 1954 until the poll ceased.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hardy|first=Phil|title=The Encyclopedia of Western Movies|year=1984|publisher=Woodbury Press|location=Minneapolis|isbn=978-0-8300-0405-8}}</ref> He appeared in the similar ''[[BoxOffice (magazine)|BoxOffice]]'' poll from 1938 to 1955, holding first place from 1943 to 1952.

Some of his movies would segue into animal adventures, in which his horse, Trigger, would go off on his own for a while with the camera following him.\n\nWith money from Rogers's films and from his public appearances going to [[Republic Pictures]], he brought a clause into his 1940 contract with the studio where he would have the right to his likeness, voice, and name for merchandising.<ref>Phillips, p. 38.</ref> There were Roy Rogers [[action figure]]s, cowboy adventure novels, and [[playset]]s, as well as a comic strip, a long-lived [[Dell Comics]] comic book series (''Roy Rogers Comics'') written by [[Gaylord Du Bois]], and a variety of marketing successes.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Schelly |first1=William |title=American Comic Book Chronicles: The 1950s |date=2013 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=9781605490540 |page=50}}</ref> Rogers was second only to [[Walt Disney]] in the number of items featuring his name.<ref>Enss and Kazanjian, p. 132.</ref>\n\nThe Sons of the Pioneers continued their popularity and have not stopped performing from the time Rogers started the group, replacing members as they retired or died (all original members are dead).
