She is considered one of the most influential vocalists of the 20th century and was one of the first [[country music]] artists to [[crossover (music)|cross over]] into [[pop music]].<ref>CBS News (February 18, 2009). \n[https://www.cbsnews.com/news/remembering-patsy-cline/ \"Remembering Patsy Cline\"] .

Popular Press. p. 180. {{ISBN|978-0-87972-821-2}}.</ref> Cline had several major hits during her eight-year recording career, including two number-one hits on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs|Hot Country and Western Sides]] chart.\n\nCline's first professional performances began at local radio station [[WINC (AM)|WINC]] when she was fifteen. In the early 1950s, Cline began appearing in a local band led by performer Bill Peer. Various local appearances led to featured performances on [[Connie B. Gay]]'s ''Town and Country'' television broadcasts. She signed her first recording contract with the [[Four Star Records|Four Star]] label in 1954, and had minor success with her earliest Four Star singles including \"[[A Church, a Courtroom, Then Goodbye]]\" (1955) and \"I've Loved and Lost Again\" (1956). In 1957 Cline made her first national television appearance on ''[[Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts]]''. After performing \"[[Walkin' After Midnight]]\", the single became her first major hit on both the country and pop charts.\n\nCline's further singles with Four Star Records were unsuccessful, although she continued performing and recording. After marrying in 1957 and giving birth in 1958, she moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], to further her career. Working with new manager Randy Hughes, Cline became a member of the [[Grand Ole Opry]] and then moved to [[Decca Records]] in 1960. Under the direction of producer [[Owen Bradley]], her musical sound shifted and she achieved consistent success. The 1961 single \"[[I Fall to Pieces]]\" became her first to top the ''Billboard'' country chart. As the song became a hit, Cline was severely injured in an automobile accident, which caused her to spend a month in the hospital. After she recovered, her next single \"[[Crazy (Willie Nelson song)|Crazy]]\" also became a major hit.\n\nDuring 1962 and 1963, Cline had hits with \"[[She's Got You]]\", \"[[When I Get Through with You]]\", \"[[So Wrong]]\" and \"[[Leavin' on Your Mind]]\". She also toured and headlined shows with more frequency. In March 1963, Cline was killed in [[1963 Camden PA-24 crash|a plane crash]] along with country performers [[Cowboy Copas]], [[Hawkshaw Hawkins]], and manager Randy Hughes, during a flight from [[Kansas City, Missouri]], back to Nashville.\n\nSince her death, Cline has been cited as one of the most celebrated, respected, and influential performers of the 20th century. Her music has influenced performers of various styles and genres.<ref name=\"CNN\">{{cite news  | last= Duke | first= Alan| url= http://edition.cnn.com/2012/07/17/showbiz/kitty-wells-legacy |title=Kitty Wells blazed country path for women |work=CNN|date=July 18, 2012 |access-date=March 6, 2013}}</ref> She has also been seen as a forerunner for women in country music, being among the first to sell records and headline concerts. In 1973, she became the first female performer to be inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]]. In the 1980s, Cline's posthumous successes continued in the mass media. She was portrayed twice in major motion pictures, including the 1985 biopic ''[[Sweet Dreams (1985 film)|Sweet Dreams]]'' starring [[Jessica Lange]]. Several documentaries and stage shows about her have been made, including the 1988 musical ''Always...Patsy Cline''. A 1991 box set of her recordings received critical acclaim. Her [[Patsy Cline's Greatest Hits|greatest hits album]] sold over 10 million copies in 2005.

Speaking of the incident in 1957 she said, \"I developed a terrible throat infection and my heart even stopped beating. The doctor put me in an oxygen tent.

Her first radio performances were at [[WINC (AM)|WINC]] in the Winchester area. According to WINC's radio disc jockey Joltin' Jim McCoy, Cline appeared in the station's waiting room one day and asked to audition. McCoy was impressed by her audition performance, reportedly saying, \"Well, if you've got nerve enough to stand before that mic and sing over the air live, I've got nerve enough to let you.\"{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|p=10}} While performing on the radio, Cline also started appearing in talent contests and created a nightclub cabaret act similar to performer [[Helen Morgan (singer)|Helen Morgan's]].<ref name=\"Country Music Hall of Fame\"/>\n\nCline's parents had marital conflicts during her childhood and by 1947 her father had deserted the family. Author Ellis Nassour of the biography ''Honky Tonk Angel: An Intimate Story of Patsy Cline'' reported Cline had a \"beautiful relationship\" with her mother. In his interviews with Hilda Hensley, he quoted Cline's mother as saying they \"were more like sisters\" than parent and child.{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|p=11}} Cline attended the ninth grade at [[John Handley High School]] in Winchester, Virginia.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia\"/> However, the family had trouble sustaining an income after her father's desertion, and Cline dropped out of high school to help support the family. She began working at Gaunt's Drug Store in the Winchester area as a clerk and [[soda jerk]].{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|p=11}}\n\n==Career==\n===1948–1953: Early career===\nAt age 15, Cline wrote a letter to the [[Grand Ole Opry]] asking for an audition. She told local photographer Ralph Grubbs about the letter, \"A friend thinks I'm crazy to send it. What do you think?\" Grubbs encouraged Cline to send it. Several weeks later, she received a return letter from the Opry asking for pictures and recordings.{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|p=12}} At the same time, [[Gospel music|Gospel]] performer [[Wally Fowler]] headlined a concert in her hometown. Cline convinced concert employees to let her backstage where she asked Fowler for an audition.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=216}} Following a successful audition, Cline's family received a call asking for her to audition for the Opry. She traveled with her mother, two siblings, and a family friend on an eight-hour journey to [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. With limited finances, they drove overnight and slept in a Nashville park the following morning. Cline auditioned for Opry performer [[Moon Mullican]] the same day. The audition was well-received and Cline expected to hear from the Opry the same day. However, she never received news and the family returned to Virginia.{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|pp=13–17}}\n\nBy the early 1950s, Cline continued performing around the local area. In 1952, she asked to audition for local country bandleader Bill Peer. Following her audition, she began performing regularly as a member of Bill Peer's Melody Boys and Girls.{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|p=10}}{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=216}} The pair's relationship turned romantic, continuing an affair for several years.

Ultimately, she became professionally known as \"Patsy Cline\".<ref name=\"Country Music Hall of Fame\"/><ref name=\"Encyclopedia\"/>\n\nIn August 1953, Cline was a contestant in a local country music contest. She won 100 dollars and the opportunity to perform as a regular on [[Connie B.

She was not officially added to the program's television shows until October 1955.{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|p=46}} Cline's television performances received critical acclaim. ''[[The Washington Star]]'' magazine praised her stage presence, commenting, \"She creates the moods through movement of her hands and body and by the lilt of her voice, reaching way down deep in her soul to bring forth the melody. Most female country music vocalists stand motionless, sing with monotonous high-pitched nasal twang.
