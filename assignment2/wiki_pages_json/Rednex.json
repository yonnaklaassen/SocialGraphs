The band originally consisted of the lead singer Mary Joe (Annika Ljungberg), alongside Bobby Sue (Kent Olander), Ken Tacky (Arne Arstrand), Billy Ray (Jonas Nilsson) and Mup (Patrick Edenberg). Pat Reiniz (Patrick Edenberg) also served as the band's producer.  The band has gone through multiple lineup changes throughout its existence, with none of the members having an uninterrupted tenure.\n\nThe group enjoyed success throughout the 1990s with [[Novelty song|novelty hits]] such as \"[[Cotton Eye Joe (Rednex song)|Cotton Eye Joe]]\", \"[[Old Pop in an Oak]]\", \"[[The Spirit of the Hawk]]\" and \"[[Wish You Were Here (Rednex song)|Wish You Were Here]]\", which often topped the charts in several European countries.\n\n==Band history==\n\n===1994–1995: Formation and ''Sex & Violins''===\nRednex was initially the brainchild of Swedish producers Janne Ericsson, Örjan \"Öban\" Öberg, and Patrick Edenberg,<ref name=\"Billboard\">Billboard.biz (2007-05-14). [http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003584990 ''Rednex On Sale For $1.5 Million'']. Retrieved on 2007-06-16.</ref> who decided to try mixing [[United States|American]] [[country music|country]] and [[folk music|folk]] with modern [[dance music|dance]] and [[pop music]]. The name \"Rednex\" was chosen as a deliberate misspelling of the word \"[[Redneck (stereotype)|redneck]]s\". The band originally consisted of the lead singer Mary Joe (Annika Ljungberg), alongside Bobby Sue (Kent Olander), Ken Tacky (Arne Arstrand), Billy Ray (Jonas Nilsson) and Mup (Patrick Edenberg).\n\nIn 1994, Rednex reworked the traditional [[folk music|folk song]] \"[[Cotton-Eyed Joe]]\", retitled \"[[Cotton Eye Joe (Rednex song)|Cotton Eye Joe]]\", as a [[Eurodance]] track, which became an international hit single. Edenberg was soon replaced by BB Stiff (Urban Landgren) after the \"Cotton Eye Joe\" release. The group's debut studio album titled ''[[Sex & Violins]]'' followed, spawning several more hit singles including \"[[Old Pop in an Oak]]\" and the ballad \"[[Wish You Were Here (Rednex Song)|Wish You Were Here]]\". However, \"Cotton Eye Joe\" remains the group's only [[United States|U.S.]] hit as of 2022 (#25 on the [[Billboard charts]] in March 1995). Two more tracks of the album, \"[[Wild 'N Free]]\" and \"[[Rolling Home (song)|Rolling Home]]\", have been released and became moderate hits. A promotional one-off single, the [[Nicole (German singer)|Nicole]] cover version \"[[Ein bißchen Frieden|Ein Bisschen Frieden]]\", has been released and labeled as \"Collo Rossi\" for the release.\n\n===1996–1997: Departure of Ljungberg and ''Riding Alone''===\nIn 1996, Rednex were featured on the charity single \"Children\", as part of the supergroup \"Hand in Hand for Children\". Later female lead singer Ljungberg was fired, partly due to disagreements with the other band members,<ref name=\"sacking\">[http://www.rednexmusic.com/ongoing-conflicts \"Ongoing Conflicts\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180312143913/http://www.rednexmusic.com/ongoing-conflicts |date=2018-03-12 }}, ''RedNex Music'', 25 July 2014.</ref> and went on to pursue a solo career.<ref name=\"Mary Joe Solo\">[http://www.eurokdj.com/search/eurodb.php?name=Ljungberg_Annika \"Annika 'Mary Joe' Ljungberg Solo Career\"], ''KDJ Eurodance'', 25 July 2014.</ref> The rest of the band took a break from live performance and started working on new material.<ref name=\"novell\">[http://magasinetnovell.se/2009/06/04/for-en-handfull-dollar/ \"Historien om Rednex\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090626180400/http://magasinetnovell.se/2009/06/04/for-en-handfull-dollar/ |date=2009-06-26 }}, ''Magasinet Novell'', 4 June 2009.</ref> In 1997, the remaining four men released one more single, \"Riding Alone\", out of ''Sex & Violins'', two years after the previous release \"Rolling Home\". Arstrand started a side project that same year called Explode, a progressive power metal band, and released the debut studio album ''Live Forever'' in Sweden.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Explode-Live-Forever/release/1406229|title=Explode - Live Forever|website=Discogs.com|access-date=17 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n===1998–2000: ''Farm Out'' and controversial lineup changes===\nIn autumn 1998, Whippy (Mia Löfgren) became the new female vocalist. They released their first single \"[[The Way I Mate]]\" in 1999. Soon after that release, Arstrand left the band, reducing the quintet to a quartet. The second studio album entitled ''[[Farm Out]]'' followed in 2000 and found some success in Europe, with the most successful single from the album, the second release \"[[The Spirit of the Hawk]]\", peaking #1 in the German Singles Chart. The album spawned a third and final single, the ballad \"[[Hold Me for a While]]\", which became a moderate success. In 2000, in the wake of [[Napster]]'s rising presence in the music industry, co-founder Edenberg outlined a new strategy for Rednex. The group would become an entertainment group rather than just a band, so not to be solely dependent on record sales. As he presented this idea to the performers during the video shoot for \"Hold Me For A While\" in Kenya, he was met by great scepticism. Nilsson replied: \"We will not become a goddamn circus act!\". The aftermath of this conflict resulted in the whole band, all four members, Löfgren, Olander, Nilsson and Landgren, being replaced for the first time.<ref name=\"novell\"/>\n\n===2001–2004: ''The Best of the West'' and more lineup changes===\nAs of January 2001, the group now consisted of the female lead singer Scarlet (Julie-Anne Tulley, formerly known as Jules Tulley from [[Dreamhouse (band)|Dreamhouse]]) from England, alongside the three male members Dagger ([[Anders Sandberg (singer)|Anders Sandberg]]) from Sweden, Joe Cagg (Roy van der Haagen) and Jay Lee (Jean-Paul Engeln) from the Netherlands. It was the first time the band were not all Swedish. In 2001, the single \"[[The Chase (Rednex song)|The Chase]]\", the first single out of their 2002 first compilation album ''[[The Best of the West]]'', has been released and charted in Germany and Switzerland. In 2002, the second and final single out of the album, a reworked 2002 remix of \"Cotton Eye Joe\", was released and made the Top 30 in Austria. In 2003, the two Dutchmen van der Haagen and Engeln were replaced by Ace Ratclaw (Tor Penten) from Sweden and Boneduster Crock (Björn Scheffler) from Germany. In October 2004, Tulley resigned from the group due to exhaustion.\n\n===2005–2006: Return of Ljungberg and Comeback===\n[[File:Rednex Live.jpg|thumb|right|2007-2008 Rednex lineup of (left to right) Anders Lundström, Annika Ljungberg and Jens Sylsjö.]]\nIn 2006, original female vocalist Ljungberg returned as Tulley's replacement in the group, she was assigned exclusive rights to license the Rednex trademark until January 1, 2009. During this period the group's focus shifted towards Scandinavia.<ref name=\"novell\"/> In January 2005, Ljungberg fired Scheffler, replacing him with her husband Snake (Jens Sylsjö). In 2006, Sandberg was also fired and replaced by Maverick ([[Anders Lundström]]). Four former members, Scheffler and Sandberg, alongside Tulley and van der Haagen, and later in April 2007 joined by Penten, also a former Rednex member, began to tour under the name \"Rednex Tribute\".<ref name=\"Rednex stämmer falska kopiorna\">{{cite web|url=http://www.expressen.se/noje/rednex-stammer-falska-kopiorna/ |title=Rednex stämmer falska kopiorna |website=Expressen.se |date=2007-07-26 |access-date=2012-12-03}}</ref>\n\nFocusing on live performance in Scandinavia, Rednex appeared at the [[2005 World Championships in Athletics|2005]] [[IAAF World Championships in Athletics]], in [[Helsinki]]. On March 11, 2006, Rednex entered the song \"[[Mama, Take Me Home (Rednex song)|Mama, Take Me Home]]\" in Semifinal 4 of the Swedish [[Melodifestivalen]] in [[Gothenburg]]. They qualified for the final via the Second Chance Round, finishing an overall sixth in the final. \"Mama, Take Me Home\" was subsequently released as the first single in a few European countries. The band's Scandinavian comeback continued as they released the second single \"[[Fe Fi (The Old Man Died)]]\" in November 2006, after having performed it at the [[Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards]]. The single was surprisingly successful, peaking #4 in the Swedish Single chart.\n\n===2009–2011: Second departure of Ljungberg and Singles===\nOn January 1, 2009, after the end of Ljungberg's management licence, control of the Rednex brand returned to the band's founders. The remaining Rednex personnel Ljungberg, Lundström and Sylsjö were fired by the returning management following a dispute, and were replaced by members of the \"Rednex Tribute\" (Tulley, Sandberg, Penten and van der Haagen), all themselves former official Rednex.

Their dance tracks also features eurodance sounds, which were very famous and popular in Europe, Oceania and South America at that time. Rednex are best known for their dance country songs \"Cotton Eye Joe\", \"Old Pop in an Oak\", \"The Way I Mate\" or \"Racing\". The style of eurodance was dance music with a female singer for the refrain and a male rapper for the verses to follow a traditional verse-chorus structure. However Rednex reversed it, with the female singer singing the verses and the male vocalist singing the bridge and the refrain. Although there are also tracks from other genres featured, such as pop ballads like \"Wish You Were Here\", \"Hold Me for a While\", \"Rolling Home\" or \"[[Anyway You Want Me (Rednex song)|Anyway You Want Me]]\" or classical country driven songs such as \"Riding Alone\", \"Ranger Jack\" or \"Nowhere In Idaho\" with less dance sounds. These tracks are not considered to be europop.\n\nWhile their debut studio album ''Sex & Violins'' has the same amount on dance/country, classic country songs and ballads, their second album ''Farm Out'' is full of their dance/country style songs, except one ballad \"Hold Me for a While\" and one country song \"Ranger Jack\". Since 2006, Rednex returned with a more mature country pop sound such in \"Mama, Take Me Home\", \"Fe Fi (The Old Man Died)\" or \"Football Is Our Religion\". The lyrics are of tongue-in-cheek, innuendo and sexual topics.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n===Public image===\nRednex usually perform as personas that parody the \"[[redneck (stereotype)|redneck]]\" stereotype. For events and promotions, but also for music videos and cover arts, the group is styled in the American redneck stereotypes. In live performances and interviews, the members usually appear in a rough, unrefined character. Each member has an individual redneck nickname (see \"Members\" area to see the nicknames).

Rednex claimed that this idea was \"totally unproven and unheard of in the music industry\".<ref name=\"Rednexmusic.com\"/> In November 2012, Rednex began a franchise operation in [[Australia]] & [[New Zealand]].
