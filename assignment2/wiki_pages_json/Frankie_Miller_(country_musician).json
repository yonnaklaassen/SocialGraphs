In 1954 he signed with [[Columbia Records]], releasing several singles, none of which sold well. Through the latter portion of the decade, Miller performed and recorded locally, sporadically releasing singles.\n\nHe recorded his biggest hit \"Blackland Farmer\" for Starday in 1956. In 1959 he signed with [[Starday Records]] and released several singles which became hits on the country charts, including \"Blackland Farmer\", the 1956 recording, \"Family Man\", \"Baby Rocked Her Dolly\", and \"A Little South of Memphis\". He performed on the ''[[Louisiana Hayride]]'' and the ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'', and was featured in ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]]'' magazine.\n\nHis last charting hit came in 1964, and he recorded with [[United Artists]] in 1965, but quit the music business soon after. He worked as a car salesman in [[Arlington, Texas]] later in life. In the 1980s, [[Bear Family Records]] reissued his LPs.\n\n==Singles==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Year\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Single\n! colspan=\"2\"| Chart Positions\n|-\n! width=\"50\"| <small>[[Hot Country Songs|US Country]]</small>\n! width=\"50\"| <small>[[Billboard Hot 100|US]]</small>\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 1959\n| \"Black Land Farmer\"\n| align=\"center\"| 5\n| align=\"center\"| 窶能n|-\n| \"Family Man\"\n| align=\"center\"| 7\n| align=\"center\"| 窶能n|-\n| 1960\n| \"Baby Rocked Her Dolly\"\n| align=\"center\"| 15\n| align=\"center\"| 窶能n|-\n| 1961\n| \"Black Land Farmer\" <small>(re-release)</small>\n| align=\"center\"| 16\n| align=\"center\"| 82\n|-\n| 1964\n| \"A Little South of Memphis\"\n| align=\"center\"| 34\n| align=\"center\"| 窶能n|}\n\n==External links==\n*John Bush, [{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p4916|pure_url=yes}} Frankie Miller] at [[Allmusic]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Miller, Frankie}}\n[[Category:1931 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:American country singer-songwriters]]\n[[Category:Singer-songwriters from Texas]]\n[[Category:Country musicians from Texas]]\n[[Category:Place of birth missing (living people)]]"
