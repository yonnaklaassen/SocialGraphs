In 1931, Jones joined the Pine Ridge String Band, which provided the musical accompaniment for the ''[[Lum and Abner]]'' show. By 1935 his pursuit of a musical career took him to [[WBZ (AM)|WBZ]] radio in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], where he met musician/songwriter [[Bradley Kincaid]], who gave him the nickname \"Grandpa Jones\" when he was 22 years old, because of his off-stage grumpiness at early-morning radio shows. Jones liked the name and decided to create a stage persona based around it. Later in life, he lived in [[Mountain View, Arkansas]]. In the 1940s he met rising country radio star [[Cousin Emmy]], from whom he learned to play the [[banjo]].\n\n==Career==\nPerforming as Grandpa Jones, he played the guitar or [[banjo]], [[yodeling|yodeled]], and sang mostly old-time [[ballad]]s. By 1937, Jones had made his way to West Virginia, where [[Cousin Emmy]] taught Jones the art of the [[clawhammer]] style of [[banjo]] playing, which gave a rough backwoods flavor to his performances.<ref name=\"Wadey\">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/obituary-grandpa-jones-1147179.html|title=Obituary: Grandpa Jones|last1=Wadey|first1=Paul|date=27 February 1998|access-date=9 January 2018|publisher=Independent}}</ref>  First experience playing music in public came at the age of 11 or thereabouts The music of the WLS Barn Dance in Chicago was a major influence on Louis, as were the [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]] records his sister brought home. <!--He won a contest which is featured as singer and host in 1929, \"I won fifty dollars in ten dollar gold pieces, and of course I went right out and brought a better guitar!\" Wonder Hall, “The Red Headed Music Maker” (famous for “It Ain’t gonna Rain No More” The winning songs were “Going Back To Texas” and “ My Dear Old Southern Home.” ???? This bit is evidently mangled and makes little sense. Comment back in once it has been clarified.--> In 1942, Jones joined [[WLW]] in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]]. It was there that he met fellow Kentuckian [[Merle Travis]]. In 1943, they made their recording debuts together for [[Syd Nathan]]'s upstart [[King Records (United States)|King Records]].<ref name=\"Encyclopedia\" /> Jones was making records under his own name for King by 1944 and had his first hit with \"It's Raining Here This Morning.\"\n\nHis recording career was put on hold when he enlisted in the United States Army during [[World War II]]. Discharged in 1946, he recorded again for King. Through 1946–1949, when he and several Opry cast members ([[Clyde Moody]] and [[Chubby Wise]] among them) were invited to become a part of the burgeoning world of television by Washington D.C. entrepreneur Connie B Gay, he became a cast member at the Old Dominion Barn Dance, broadcast over WRVA in Richmond, Virginia.<ref name=\"Bluegrass\"/> In March 1946, he moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], and started performing on the [[Grand Ole Opry]]. He married Ramona Riggins on October 14, 1946. As an accomplished performer herself, she would take part in his performances. Jones' vaudeville humor was a bridge to television. His more famous songs include \"T For Texas,\" \"Are You From Dixie,\" \"Night Train To Memphis,\" \"[[Good Old Mountain Dew|Mountain Dew]],\" and \"Eight More Miles To Louisville.\"\n\nIn the fall of 1968,<ref name=\"Bluegrass\"/> Jones became a charter cast member on the long-running television show ''[[Hee Haw]]'', often responding to the show's skits with his trademark phrase \"Outrageous.\" He also played banjo, by himself or with banjo player [[David \"Stringbean\" Akeman]]. A musical segment featured in the early years had Jones and \"his lovely wife Ramona\" singing while ringing bells held in their hands and strapped to their ankles. A favorite skit had off-camera cast members ask, \"Hey Grandpa, what's for supper?\" in which he would describe a delicious, country-style meal, often in a rhyming, [[talking blues]] style. Sometimes he would describe something not so good; i.e. \"Because you were bad, thawed out [[TV dinner]]s!\"\n\n==Testimony==\nA resident of rural [[Ridgetop, Tennessee]], outside Nashville, he was a neighbor and friend of fellow musician [[David \"Stringbean\" Akeman]]. On the morning of November 11, 1973, Jones discovered the bodies of Akeman and his wife, Estelle, who had been murdered during the night by robbers.<ref>Cooper, Peter (15 October 2014). \"1973 killings brought fear to Nashville\".
