A five-time [[Grammy]] award-winner, she was a member of the [[Carter Family]] and the second wife of singer [[Johnny Cash]]. Prior to her marriage to Cash, she was known as '''June Carter''' and continued to be credited as such even after her marriage (as well as on songwriting credits predating it). She played guitar, [[banjo]], harmonica, and [[autoharp]], and acted in several films and television shows. Carter Cash was inducted into the Christian Music Hall of Fame in 2009.<ref>{{cite web| year = 2009 | title = Awards|url= http://hallmuseum.com/9awards.htm | publisher= Christian Music Hall of Fame and Museum | access-date = April 15, 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120515174455/http://hallmuseum.com/9awards.htm|archive-date = May 15, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nJune Carter Cash was born Valerie June Carter in [[Maces Spring, Virginia]], to [[Maybelle Carter|Maybelle]] (née Addington) and [[Ezra Carter]]. Her mother was a country music performer with June's aunt Sara and uncle [[A. P. Carter]] and she performed with the Carter Family from the age of 10, in 1939. In March 1943, when the Carter Family trio stopped recording together at the end of the [[WBT (AM)|WBT]] contract, Maybelle Carter, with encouragement from her husband Ezra, formed \"The Carter Sisters and Mother Maybelle\" with her daughters, Helen on accordion, Anita Carter on bass fiddle and June on autoharp and as front person and comedian. The new group first aired on radio station [[WRNL]] in [[Richmond, Virginia]], on June 1. Doc (Addington) and Carl (McConnell)—Maybelle's brother and cousin, respectively, known as \"The Virginia Boys\", joined them in late 1945. June, then 16, was a co-announcer with Ken Allyn and did the commercials on the radio shows for Red Star Flour, Martha White, and [[Thalhimers|Thalhimers Department Store]], just to name a few.<ref name=\"JUNE CARTER CASH BIOGRAPHY\">{{Citation | url = http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/cash_june_carter/bio.jhtml | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20040106040953/http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/cash_june_carter/bio.jhtml | url-status = dead | archive-date = January 6, 2004 | title = Artists | contribution = June Carter Cash | type = biography | publisher = CMT}}</ref> For the next year {1946}, the Carters and Doc and Carl did show dates within driving range of Richmond, through [[Virginia]], [[Maryland]], [[Delaware]], and [[Pennsylvania]].

With her thin and lanky frame, June Carter often played a comedic foil during the group's performances alongside other Opry stars [[Faron Young]] and [[Webb Pierce]]. Carl McConnell wrote in his memoirs that June was \"a natural-born clown, if there ever was one\". Decades later, Carter revived Aunt Polly for the 1976 TV series ''Johnny Cash & Friends''.\n\nAfter Doc and Carl dropped out of the music business in late 1946, Maybelle and her daughters moved to [[Sunshine Sue|Sunshine Sue Workman's]] \"Old Dominion Barn Dance\" on the [[WRVA (AM)|WRVA]] Richmond station. After a while there, they moved to [[WNOX]] in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], where they met [[Chet Atkins]] with Homer and Jethro.\n\nIn 1949, the Carter Sisters and Mother Maybelle, with their lead guitarist, Atkins, were living in [[Springfield, Missouri]], and performing regularly at [[KWTO (AM)|KWTO]]. Ezra \"Eck\" Carter, Maybelle's husband and manager of the group, declined numerous offers from the [[Grand Ole Opry]] to move the act to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], because the Opry would not permit Atkins to accompany the group onstage. Atkins' reputation as a guitar player had begun to spread, and studio musicians were fearful that he would displace them as a 'first-call' player if he came to Nashville. Finally, in 1950, Opry management relented and the group, along with Atkins, became part of the Opry company. Here the family befriended [[Hank Williams]] and [[Elvis Presley]] (to whom they were distantly related), and June met Johnny Cash.\n\nCarter and her sisters, with their mother Maybelle and aunt Sara joining in from time to time, reclaimed the name \"The Carter Family\" for their act during the 1960s and 1970s.\n\n==Career highlights==\n[[File:President Richard Nixon, Pat Nixon, June Carter Cash, and Johnny Cash.jpg|thumb|Cash with husband [[Johnny Cash|Johnny]], President [[Richard Nixon]] and First Lady [[Pat Nixon]] on April 17, 1970.]]\nWhile Carter may be best known for singing and songwriting, she was also an author, dancer, actress, comedian, philanthropist, and humanitarian.<ref>{{Citation|url=http://johnnycash.com/june/june2.html |contribution=June |title=Johnny Cash.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080813152000/http://www.johnnycash.com/june/june2.html |archive-date=August 13, 2008 }}</ref> Director [[Elia Kazan]] saw her perform at the Grand Ole Opry in 1955 and encouraged her to study acting.

She was notable as [[Mayhayley Lancaster]] playing alongside husband Cash in the [[1983 in film|1983]] [[television movie]] ''[[Murder in Coweta County]]''.

As a solo artist, she became somewhat successful with upbeat country tunes of the 1950s, such as \"Jukebox Blues\" and the comedic hit \"No Swallerin' Place\" by Frank Loesser. Carter also recorded \"The Heel\" in the 1960s along with many other songs.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Carter wrote the song \"[[Ring of Fire (song)|Ring of Fire]]\", which later went on to be a hit for her future husband, Johnny Cash. She co-wrote the song with fellow songwriter [[Merle Kilgore]]. Carter wrote the lyrics about her relationship with Cash and she offered the song to her sister, [[Anita Carter]], who was the first singer to record the song. In 1963, Cash recorded the song with the Carter Family singing backup and added mariachi horns. The song became a number-one hit and went on to become one of the most recognizable songs in the world of country music.\nIn her autobiography, ''I Walked the Line'', Cash's first wife [[Vivian Cash]] disputes the myth that Carter co-wrote the song \"[[Ring of Fire (song)|Ring of Fire]]\". Vivian relates the story that Cash told her in 1963: he wrote the song with Kilgore and Curly Lewis while fishing and he was going to give Carter half credit because \"She needs the money. And I feel sorry for her.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cash, with Ann Sharpsteen |first1=Vivian |title=I Walked the Line: My Life with Johnny |date=2007 |publisher=Scribner |page=338}}</ref>\n\nCarter's first notable studio performance with Johnny Cash occurred in 1964 when she duetted with Cash on \"[[It Ain't Me Babe]]\", a [[Bob Dylan]] composition, that was released as a single and on Cash's album ''[[Orange Blossom Special (album)|Orange Blossom Special]]''. In 1967, the two found more substantial success with their recording of \"[[Jackson (Johnny Cash and June Carter song)|Jackson]]\", which was followed by a collaboration album, ''[[Carryin' On with Johnny Cash and June Carter]]''. All these releases predated her marriage to Cash, after which she changed her professional name to June Carter Cash. She continued to work with Cash on recordings and on stage for the rest of her life, recording a number of duets with Cash for his various albums and being a regular on ''[[The Johnny Cash Show]]'' from 1969 to 1971 and on Cash's annual Christmas specials. After ''Carryin' On'', Carter recorded one more direct collaboration album, ''[[Johnny Cash and His Woman]]'', released in 1973, and, along with her daughters, was a featured vocalist on Cash's 1974 album ''[[The Junkie and the Juicehead Minus Me]]''. She also shared sleeve credit with her husband on a 2000 small-label gospel release, ''[[Return to the Promised Land]].''\n\nAlthough she provided vocals on many recordings and shared the billing with Cash on several album releases, June Carter Cash only recorded three solo albums during her lifetime: the first, ''[[Appalachian Pride]]'', released in 1975, ''[[Press On (June Carter Cash album)|Press On]]'' (1999), and ''[[Wildwood Flower (album)|Wildwood Flower]]'', released posthumously in 2003 and produced by her son, [[John Carter Cash]]. ''Appalachian Pride'' is the only one of the three on which Johnny Cash does not perform, while ''Press On'' is notable for featuring Carter singing her original arrangement of \"Ring of Fire\".\n\nOne of her final appearances was a non-speaking/non-singing appearance in the music video for her husband's 2003 single, \"[[Hurt (Nine Inch Nails song)|Hurt]]\", filmed a few months before her death. One of her last known public appearances was on April 7, 2003, just over a month before her death, when she appeared on the [[CMT (U.S. TV channel)|CMT Flameworthy]] awards program to accept an achievement award on behalf of her husband, who was too ill to attend.\n\nShe won a Grammy award in 1999 for, ''Press On''. Her last album, ''Wildwood Flower'', won two additional Grammys. It contains bonus video enhancements showing extracts from the film of the recording sessions, which took place at the Carter Family estate in [[Hiltons, Virginia]], on September 18–20, 2002. The songs on the album include \"Big Yellow Peaches\", \"Sinking in the Lonesome Sea\", \"Temptation\", and the trademark staple \"[[Wildwood Flower]]\". Due to her involvement in providing backing vocals on many of her husband's recordings, a further posthumous release occurred in 2014, when ''[[Out Among the Stars]]'' was released under Johnny Cash's name. The album consists of previously unreleased recordings from the early 1980s, including two on which June Carter Cash provides duet vocals.\n\nHer autobiography was published in 1979, and she wrote a memoir, ''From the Heart'', almost 10 years later.<ref name = \"mtv\" />\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:JohnnyCashJuneCarterCash1969.jpg|thumb|Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash in 1969]]\nCarter was married three times and had one child with each husband.
