Parks arranged Cooder's \"One Meatball\" according to Parks' 1984 interview with Bob Claster.\n\nCooder was a [[session musician]] on various recording sessions with [[the Rolling Stones]] in 1968 and 1969, and his contributions appear on the albums ''[[Let It Bleed]]'' ([[Yank Rachell|Yank Rachell-style]] [[mandolin]] on \"[[Love in Vain]]\"), and ''[[Sticky Fingers]]'', on which he contributed the slide guitar on \"[[Sister Morphine]]\". During this period, Cooder joined with [[Mick Jagger]], [[Charlie Watts]], [[Bill Wyman]], and longtime Rolling Stones [[sideman]] [[Nicky Hopkins]] to record ''[[Jamming with Edward!]]''. Cooder also played slide guitar for the 1970 film soundtrack ''[[Performance (soundtrack)|Performance]]'', which contained Jagger's first solo single, \"[[Memo from Turner]]\". The 1975 [[compilation album]] ''[[Metamorphosis (Rolling Stones album)|Metamorphosis]]'' features an uncredited Cooder contribution to Bill Wyman's \"Downtown Suzie\".\n\nCooder also collaborated with [[Lowell George]] of [[Little Feat]], playing [[slide guitar|bottleneck guitar]] on the original version of \"[[Willin' (Little Feat song)|Willin']]\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/little-feat-mw0000653350/credits|title=Little Feat – Little Feat &#124; Credits|website=AllMusic |access-date=February 5, 2010}}</ref> He also played bottleneck guitar and mandolin on two tracks on the Gordon Lightfoot album ''[[Sit Down Young Stranger]]'' (later re-titled ''If You Could Read My Mind''), recorded in late 1969 and released in early 1970.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rylanders.free-online.co.uk/RySite/RyPages/SitDownStranger.html |title=Gordon Lightfoot Sit Down Young Stranger |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=Rylanders: Ry Cooder Discography|access-date=September 18, 2022}}</ref>\n\n===1970s===\nThroughout the 1970s, Cooder released a series of [[Warner Bros. Records]] albums that showcased his guitar work, initially on the [[Reprise Records]] label, before being reassigned to the main Warners label along with many of Reprise's artists when the company retired the imprint. Cooder explored bygone musical [[genres]] and found old-time recordings which he then personalized and updated. Thus, on his breakthrough album, ''[[Into the Purple Valley]]'', he chose unusual instrumentations and arrangements of blues, gospel, [[calypso music|calypso]], and country songs (giving a tempo change to the cowboy ballad \"Billy the Kid\"). The album opened with the song \"How Can You Keep on Moving (Unless You Migrate Too)\" by [[Agnes \"Sis\" Cunningham]] about the [[Okie]]s who were not welcomed when they migrated west to escape the [[Dust Bowl]] in the 1930s – to which Cooder gave a rousing-yet-satirical march accompaniment. In 1970 he collaborated with Ron Nagle and performed on his ''Bad Rice'' album released on Warner Brothers. His later 1970s albums (with the exception of ''[[Jazz (Ry Cooder album)|Jazz]]'', which explored ragtime/vaudeville) do not fall under a single genre description, but his self-titled first album could be described as blues; ''Into the Purple Valley'', ''[[Boomer's Story]]'', and ''[[Paradise and Lunch]]'' as [[folk music|folk]] and blues; ''[[Chicken Skin Music]]'' and ''Showtime'' as a mix of [[Tejano music|Tex-Mex]] and [[Hawaiian music|Hawaiian]]; ''[[Bop Till You Drop]]'' as 1950s [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]]; and ''[[Borderline (Ry Cooder album)|Borderline]]'' and ''Get Rhythm'' as rock-based. His 1979 album ''Bop Till You Drop'' was the first [[popular music]] album released that was [[digital recording|recorded digitally]], using the early 3M digital mastering recorder.<ref name=\"Mixonline 2007\">{{cite web | title=1978 3M Digital Audio Mastering System | website=Mixonline | date=2007-09-01 | url=https://www.mixonline.com/technology/1978-3m-digital-audio-mastering-system-377974 | access-date=2023-03-18}}</ref> It yielded his biggest [[chart-topper|hit]], an R&B [[cover version]] of [[Elvis Presley]]'s 1960s recording \"[[Little Sister (Elvis Presley song)|Little Sister]]\".\n\nCooder is credited on [[Van Morrison]]'s 1979 album ''[[Into the Music]]'', for slide guitar on the song \"[[Full Force Gale]]\". He also played guitar on [[Judy Collins]]' 1970 concert tour, and is featured on ''[[Living (Judy Collins album)|Living]]'', the 1971 live album recorded during that tour. He also learned from and performed with [[Gabby Pahinui]] and [[Leland Isaacs, Sr.|\"Atta\" Isaacs]] in Hawaii during the [[Hawaiian Renaissance]] of the early 1970s. He is also credited for guitars on several 1971 recordings by [[Nancy Sinatra]] that were produced by Andy Wickman and Lenny Waronker – \"Is Anybody Goin' To San Antone\", \"Hook & Ladder\", and \"Glory Road\". Cooder is credited as a mandolin player on Gordon Lightfoot's ''[[Don Quixote (album)|Don Quixote]]'' album in 1972.\n\n===1980s===\nCooder has worked as a studio musician and has also scored many [[film soundtrack]]s including the [[Wim Wenders]] film ''[[Paris, Texas (film)|Paris, Texas]]'' (1984).

Cooder, along with [[Arlen Roth]], dubbed all slide and regular blues guitar parts in the 1986 film ''[[Crossroads (1986 film)|Crossroads]]'', a take on blues legend [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]]. In 1988, Cooder played slide guitar on and produced ''Live and Let Live'', the album by his longtime backing vocalists [[Bobby King]] and [[Terry Evans (musician)|Terry Evans]] on [[Rounder Records]]. He also played extensively on their 1990 self-produced Rounder release ''Rhythm, Blues, Soul & Grooves''. Cooder's music also appeared on two episodes of the television program ''Tales From the Crypt'': \"The Man Who Was Death\" and \"The Thing From the Grave\".<ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/album/original-music-from-tales-from-the-crypt-w93724 Review of ''Tales From the Crypt''] by Steven McDonald, ''AllMusic.com''</ref>\n\nIn 1984, Cooder played on two songs on the debut album by Carla Olson & the Textones, ''Midnight Mission'' – \"Carla's Number One is to Survive\" and the previously unreleased [[Bob Dylan]] song \"Clean Cut Kid\". Shortly thereafter he was writing and recording the music for the film ''Blue City'' and asked the band to appear in the film performing. (He took them to the studio and produced \"You Can Run\" which he also played on.)\n\nIn 1985, Cooder was a guest artist on the song \"Rough Edges\" from [[Kim Carnes]]' album ''[[Barking at Airplanes]]''. Kim named her son Ry as a tribute to Ry Cooder.\n\nAlso in 1988, Cooder produced and featured in the [[Les Blank]]-directed concert documentary film ''Ry Cooder & The Moula Banda Rhythm Aces: Let's Have a Ball'' where he plays in collaboration with a selection of musicians famous in their various musical fields.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0170532/|title=Ry Cooder & The Moula Banda Rhythm Aces: Let's Have a Ball (1988)|author=RondoHatton|date=August 31, 1991|work=IMDb|access-date=January 7, 2015}}</ref> The following year, he played a janitor in the [[Jim Henson]] series ''[[The Ghost of Faffner Hall]]'', in the episode \"Music Is More Than Technique\".<ref>Archived at [https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211211/JvLkt_0dPP8 Ghostarchive]{{cbignore}} and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20130709013916/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvLkt_0dPP8 Wayback Machine]{{cbignore}}: {{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvLkt_0dPP8 |title=The Jim Henson Company YouTube Channel |publisher=[[YouTube]]|date=January 12, 2012 |access-date=June 10, 2012}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\n===1990s===\nIn the early 1990s, Cooder collaborated on two [[world music]] \"crossover\" albums, which blended the traditional American musical genres that Cooder has championed throughout his career with the contemporary improvised music of India and Africa. For ''[[A Meeting by the River]]'' (1993), which also featured his son [[Joachim Cooder]] on percussion, he teamed with [[Hindustani classical music|Hindustani]] classical musician [[Vishwa Mohan Bhatt|V.M. Bhatt]], a virtuoso of the [[Mohan Veena]] (a modified 20-string [[archtop guitar]] of Bhatt's own invention) and Sukhvinder Singh Namdhari also known as Pinky Tabla Player.\n\nIn 1993 he teamed up with [[Mali]] a multi-instrumentalist [[Ali Farka Toure]] to record the album ''[[Talking Timbuktu]]'', which he also produced. The album, released in 1994, also featured longtime Cooder collaborator [[Jim Keltner]] on drums, veteran blues guitarist [[Clarence \"Gatemouth\" Brown]], jazz bassist [[John Patitucci]] and African percussionists and musicians including [[Hamma Sankare]] and Oumar Toure. Both albums won the [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Global Music Album|Best World Music Album]] in 1994 and 1995 respectively. Cooder also worked with [[Tuvans|Tuvan]] [[Overtone singing|throat singers]] for the score to the 1993 film ''[[Geronimo: An American Legend]]''.\n\nIn 1995 he performed in ''[[The Wizard of Oz in Concert: Dreams Come True]]'', a musical performance of the popular story at the [[Lincoln Center]] in New York to benefit the [[Children's Defense Fund]]. The performance was originally broadcast on both TBS and TNT. It was issued on CD and video in 1996.\n\nIn the late 1990s Cooder played a significant role in the increased appreciation of traditional [[Cuba]]n music, due to his collaboration as producer of the ''[[Buena Vista Social Club (album)|Buena Vista Social Club]]'' (1997) recording, which became a worldwide hit and revived the careers of some of the greatest surviving exponents of 20th century Cuban music. [[Wim Wenders]], who had previously directed 1984's ''[[Paris, Texas (film)|Paris, Texas]]'', directed a documentary film of the musicians involved, ''[[Buena Vista Social Club (film)|Buena Vista Social Club]]'' (1999), which was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] in 2000.<ref name=\"NY Times\">{{cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/176586/Buena-Vista-Social-Club/details |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071208064255/http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/176586/Buena-Vista-Social-Club/details |url-status=dead |archive-date=December 8, 2007 |department=Movies & TV Dept. |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2007 |title=NY Times: Buena Vista Social Club |access-date=November 22, 2008}}</ref> The enterprise cost him a $25,000 fine for violating the [[United States embargo against Cuba]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/mar/04/jazz.popandrock|work=[[The Guardian]]|title=Interview – From the Dust|date=March 3, 2007|access-date=May 27, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2001-feb-06-ca-21581-story.html|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|title=With Help From Up High, Cooder's Back in Cuba|author= Hancock, Jay|date=February 6, 2001|access-date=December 1, 2022}}</ref>\n\n===2000s===\nCooder's 2005 album ''[[Chávez Ravine (album)|Chávez Ravine]]'' was touted by his [[record label]] as being \"a post-World War II-era American narrative of 'cool cats', radios, UFO sightings, J.

Cooder says, \"Here is some music for a place you don't know, up a road you don't go. Chávez Ravine, where the sidewalk ends.\"<ref name=Nonesuch/> Drawing from the various musical strains of Los Angeles, including [[conjunto]], R&B, Latin pop, and jazz, Cooder and friends conjure the ghosts of Chávez Ravine and Los Angeles at mid-century. On this fifteen-track album, sung in Spanish and English, Cooder is joined by [[East Los Angeles, California|East L.A.]] legends like Chicano music patriarch [[Lalo Guerrero]], [[Pachuco]] boogie king [[Don Tosti]], [[Thee Midniters]] front man Little Willie G, and Ersi Arvizu, of The Sisters and [[El Chicano]].\n\nCooder's next record was released in 2007. Entitled ''[[My Name Is Buddy]]'', it tells the story of Buddy Red Cat, who travels and sees the world in the company of his like-minded friends, Lefty Mouse and Rev. Tom Toad.

It is the completion of his California trilogy. Based on the [[drag racing]] culture of the early 1960s, the album is set on the desert salt flats in southern California. The disc was also released as a deluxe edition with stories written by Cooder to accompany the music.\n\nIn late 2009, Cooder toured Japan, New Zealand, and Australia with [[Nick Lowe]], performing some of Lowe's songs and a selection of Cooder's own material, mainly from the 1970s. Joaquim Cooder (Ry's son) provided percussion, and [[Juliette Commagere]] and [[Alex Lilly]] contributed backing vocals.\n\nThe song \"Diaraby\", which Cooder recorded with [[Ali Farka Touré]], is used as the theme to ''[[The World (radio program)|The World]]'s'' Geo Quiz. ''The World'' is a radio show distributed by [[Public Radio International]].\n\nIn 2009, Cooder performed in ''[[The People Speak (film)|The People Speak]]'', a documentary feature film that uses dramatic and musical performances of the letters, diaries, and speeches of everyday Americans, based on historian [[Howard Zinn]]'s ''[[A People's History of the United States]]''.
