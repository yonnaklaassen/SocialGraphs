The band consists of [[Cody Canada]] (lead guitar/vocals), Grady Cross (guitar), [[Randy Ragsdale]] (drums), and Jeremy Plato (bass guitar). The group released five studio albums and three live albums from 1994 until 2010. The band was at the forefront of the rise of the red dirt music scene in Oklahoma and the Texas Music scene. After almost 15 years together, the group disbanded in 2010. In September 2024, the band announced their reunion after teasing it for weeks on their social media.<ref>https://savingcountrymusic.com/cross-canadian-ragweed-to-reunite-play-show-in-oklahoma/#comments</ref><ref>https://savingcountrymusic.com/on-this-cross-canadian-ragweed-tease/</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Formation===\nCross Canadian Ragweed started when Randy Ragsdale met Cody Canada, Matt Weidemann, and Grady Cross, who had also been playing together. The four had known each other since grade school and started playing together in Ragsdale's home seven nights a week under the tutelage of Ragsdale's father, Johnny, who had worked with musical artists in the area. After playing together, the band officially formed by combining a part of every band member's last name, coming up with the name Cross Canadian Ragweed. Matt Weidemann left the band, and Jeremy Plato joined the band, playing the bass guitar. After finishing high school, the band moved to the [[College Town]] of [[Stillwater, Oklahoma]], where acts like Mike McClure's [[The Great Divide (band)|The Great Divide]] and singer-songwriter [[Jimmy LaFave]] had established enough of a local scene to earn Stillwater the nickname North Austin.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/north_austin_stillwater_ok_nickname/|title=Barry Popik|website=Barrypopik.com|access-date=April 24, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===''Carney'' and ''Live And Loud at the Wormy Dog Saloon''===\nThe group had already received significant [[college radio]] [[airplay (song)|airplay]] before it released its first album, ''Carney'' in 1998 on their own independent label. Initially, selling the band in the market it was based in, was considered by music observers to be far-fetched; however, the fan base's passion and loyalty to the band allowed them to find success in releasing that first album. Carney was well received, then the band released ''Live and Loud at the Wormy Dog Saloon'' in 1999, which was also well received, especially in the local scene.\n\n===''Highway 377''===\nRagweed released its second studio album Highway 377 in 2001, though it was recorded in 1999. It propelled them into wider audience and into [[Texas]], where Canada was born and also where the band had been touring heavily. Though not a released single, the song \"Long Way Home\" was featured on several [[Dodge]] Truck Commercials in both Texas and Oklahoma which added to the popularity of the band. The band paid tribute to drummer Randy Ragsdale's father Johnny, who has passed away from cancer in 1997 with the track \"Johnny's Song.\"\n\n===''Live and Loud at Billy Bob's Texas''===\nIn 2002 Ragweed recorded the popular live album ''Live and Loud at Billy Bob's Texas'' in [[Fort Worth, Texas]]. The songs were mainly live versions of songs off ''Carney'' and ''Highway 377'', with a handful of cover songs.\n\n===''Cross Canadian Ragweed (Purple Album)''===\nIn 2002, the group then signed with [[Show Dog Nashville|Universal South]] Records and released a self-titled album also alternately known as 'The Purple Album'.  It was a tribute to the band's \"little sister\" Mandi Ragsdale, the younger sister of the band's drummer Randy Ragsdale, who had died in an auto accident near [[College Station, Texas]]<ref>https://www.oklahoman.com/story/news/2001/09/18/yukon-girl-9-dies-in-texas-collision/62130485007/</ref>, and whose favorite color was purple. The album produced charted singles \"17\" and the ballad \"Constantly\", and released a music video for the hard rock track \"Don't Need You.\"\n\n===''Soul Gravy''===\nRagweed's 2004 album, ''[[Soul Gravy]]'', debuted at No.&nbsp;4 on the Billboard charts. [[Lee Ann Womack]] provided background vocals on the popular single \"Sick and Tired\". The project also saw the re-release of the song \"Alabama\" (off of 2001's Highway 377) with a heavier electric sound, which appeared on the [[Billboard charts|Billboard Charts]] as well.\n\n===''Garage''===\nIn October 2005 the band released ''Garage'', described by both the band and raters at [[AllMusic]] as the group's \"grungiest album ever.\" Two songs, \"Fighting' For\" and \"This Time Around\" both became hits off the album. The album charted higher than any studio album the band ever released and for the first time, the band broke into rock radio airplay across the United States due to the song \"Dimebag\", a tribute to former [[Damageplan]] and [[Pantera]] guitarist \"Dimebag\" [[Darrell Abbott]], who had been killed months earlier during a concert, in addition to a heavier rock sound overall.\n\n===''Back To Tulsa: Live And Loud At Cain's Ballroom''===\nIn late 2006, Ragweed released their third and final live album, ''Live and Loud At Cain's Ballroom'' in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]]. The band's 24 song project was well received and featured songs from their previous projects The Purple Album, Soul Gravy, and Garage. It also featured a handful of covers as well such as [[Neil Young]]'s [[The Needle and the Damage Done]] and [[Robert Earl Keen]]'s \"Lonely Feeling.\"\n\n===''Mission California''===\nCross Canadian Ragweed recorded ''[[Mission California]]'', their fourth studio album, at the end of March 2007. The namesake of the album was due to the recording taking place in [[San Diego]], California. The band spent 25 days in the studio; the first 5 cutting 15 tracks, the next 20 polishing each. [[Lee Ann Womack]] once again laid down background vocals on 4 of the tracks to include the [[Chris Knight (musician)|Chris Knight]] cover \"Cry Lonely.\" ''[[Mission California]]'' was released on October 2, 2007. AllMusic reviewed the Album and found that the project was \"name appropriately, the band sounds much more a progressive West Coast sound in many of the tracks and less rural rock.\"\n\n===''Happiness and All the Other Things''===\nThe band's tenth and final album, ''[[Happiness and All the Other Things]]'' was released on August 31, 2009, commemorating the band's 15th Anniversary. It featured 12 new studio tracks and three live tracks. Recorded in California, this album includes a track entitled \"51 Pieces\", which Canada penned with Micky Braun. The song was based on an incident where Ohio State police ransacked the band's bus after a stop in Cleveland at the [[House of Blues]]. It also featured \"Blue Bonnets\" which is dedicated to Cody's oldest son Dierks. ''[[Happiness and All the Other Things]]'' was officially dedicated to the late Randall Locke ([[Willie Nelson]]'s long-time stage manager) who suddenly died on May 6, 2009. Other popular tracks were \"To Find My Love\", \"Burn Like The Sun\", and \"Kick In The Head.\"\n\n=== Hiatus and band break-up ===\nIn May 2010, Cross Canadian Ragweed announced a hiatus from touring.  In a band press release, Ragsdale explained, \"Right now, I need to be at home for my family, particularly my son JC, who has autism. He's 10 years old now and still struggling in his development. I feel the only way I can help him is to be more hands on and close to home.\" Despite Ragsdale wanting to \"get another drummer and press on,\" Canada stated \"We’ve always said from the start, we’re Ragweed as the four of us, or not Ragweed at all.\"<ref>{{cite news  |title=Cross Canadian Ragweed cancels Oklahoma City Family Jam  |url=http://blog.newsok.com/bamsblog/2010/05/28/cross-canadian-ragweed-cancels-oklahoma-city-family-jam-still-playing-sundays-music-and-mayhem-in-eufaula/  |url-status=dead  |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120701165713/http://blog.newsok.com/bamsblog/2010/05/28/cross-canadian-ragweed-cancels-oklahoma-city-family-jam-still-playing-sundays-music-and-mayhem-in-eufaula/  |archive-date=July 1, 2012  }}</ref> In September 2010, Canada officially announced the band was calling it quits by announcing their  \"Last Call Show\" in October 2010 at Joe's Bar in Chicago, IL, stating \"as far as that’s concerned, Oct 24 is the last one, the last gig.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.caller.com/news/2010/sep/16/cross-canadian-ragweed-frontmans-career-evolves/|title=Cross Canadian Ragweed frontman's career evolves|website=Caller.com|access-date=April 24, 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Post break-up ===\nSince Cross Canadian Ragweed, Canada and Plato formed [[The Departed (band)|The Departed]] with fellow [[Yukon, Oklahoma|Yukon]]-native Dave Bowen (drums), Seth James (guitar), and Steve Littleton (keyboards), releasing their debut album \"This Is Indian Land\" in June 2011.<ref>{{cite news  |title=Cody Canada & The Departed digging into red dirt roots with debut album, \"This Is Indian Land\"  |url=http://blog.newsok.com/bamsblog/2011/06/17/cody-canada-the-departed-digging-into-red-dirt-roots-with-debut-album-this-is-indian-land/  |url-status=dead  |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120707211521/http://blog.newsok.com/bamsblog/2011/06/17/cody-canada-the-departed-digging-into-red-dirt-roots-with-debut-album-this-is-indian-land/  |archive-date=July 7, 2012  }}</ref>\nRagsdale and Cross both returned to Yukon.

The show will take place on April 12, 2025 at [[Boone Pickens Stadium]].<ref>https://savingcountrymusic.com/cross-canadian-ragweed-to-reunite-play-show-in-oklahoma/#comments</ref>\n\n\n==Influences and sound==\nThe band was influenced by [[grunge]], [[alternative rock]] of the 1990s along with early [[southern rock]] acts as well as [[outlaw country]]. Canada said that rock bands such as [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Pearl Jam]], [[Stone Temple Pilots]], [[AC/DC]], and [[Soundgarden]] all were a part of the influence on the band's sound as well as country music influences [[Merle Haggard]], [[Willie Nelson]], and [[Robert Earl Keen]], in addition to southern rockers [[Marshall Tucker Band]], and [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]], among others. Due to their unique sound, the band often had a hard time getting radio airplay on either mainstream rock or country stations.\n\n==Notable appearances==\nThe band frequently played with other stars of the [[Red Dirt (music)|Red Dirt]] and Texas Music scene including [[Stoney Larue]], [[Jason Boland & The Stragglers]], [[Micky & The Motorcars]], [[Reckless Kelly (band)|Reckless Kelly]], (Canada's brother-in-law) [[Wade Bowen]], [[No Justice]], Johnny Cooper, Seth James, and [[Brandon Rhyder]].\n\nThe band played with country music star [[Dierks Bentley]] numerous times. Bentley referenced the band in his song \"[[Free and Easy (Down the Road I Go)]]\", singing that \"Ragweed's rockin' on the radio\".\n\n[[Minnesota Twins]] [[catcher]] [[Ryan Doumit]] comes to bat to their song \"Alabama\".\n\n\"Cry Lonely\" is a playable track in ''[[Rock Band Country Track Pack]]''.\n\nThe song \"Boys from Oklahoma\" plays as the credits roll in the movie [[Leaves of Grass (film)|Leaves of Grass]] starring [[Edward Norton]] and [[Susan Sarandon]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1151359/soundtrack|title=Leaves of Grass (2009) |website=IMDb.com|access-date=April 24, 2020}}</ref> The film is a Stoner Comedy set in Oklahoma.\n\n\"Anywhere But Here\" is played during the Season 2 Episode 6 of the [[NBC]] television series ''[[Grimm (TV series)|Grimm]]''.\n\n==Band members==\n<!--Do not change the order of the members, as they are in order of length of tenure-->\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n'''Current members'''\n* [[Cody Canada]] – lead and occasional backing vocals, lead guitar, harmonica {{small|(1994–2010, 2024–present)}}\n* Grady Cross – rhythm guitar, backing vocals {{small|(1994–2010, 2024–present)}}\n* Randy Ragsdale – drums, percussion {{small|(1994–2010, 2024–present)}}\n* Jeremy Plato – bass, backing and occasional lead vocals {{small|(1998–2010, 2024–present)}}\n\n{{col-2}}\n\n'''Former members'''\n* Matt Weidemann – bass, backing vocals {{small|(1994–1998)}}\n\n{{col-end}}\n\n'''Timeline'''\n{{#tag:timeline|\nImageSize = width:900 height:auto barincrement:20\nPlotArea = left:100 bottom:120 top:0 right:10\nAlignbars = justify\nDateFormat = mm/dd/yyyy\nPeriod = from:01/01/1994 till:{{#time:m/d/Y}}\nTimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy\nLegend = position:bottom columns:3\nScaleMajor = increment:2 start:1994\nScaleMinor = increment:1 start:1995\n\nColors =\n id:lvocals value:red         legend:Lead_vocals\n id:bvocals value:pink        legend:Backing_vocals\n id:lguitar value:teal        legend:Lead_guitar,_harmonica\n id:rguitar value:green       legend:Rhythm_guitar\n id:bass    value:blue        legend:Bass\n id:drums   value:orange      legend:Drums,_percussion\n id:album   value:black       legend:Studio_album\n\nLineData =\n color:album layer:back\n at:01/01/1998 \n at:01/02/2001\n at:09/10/2002\n at:03/09/2004\n at:10/04/2005\n at:10/02/2007\n at:08/31/2009\n\nBarData =\n bar:Canada     text:Cody Canada\n bar:Cross      text:Grady Cross\n bar:Weidemann  text:Matt Weidemann\n bar:Plato      text:Jeremy Plato\n bar:Ragsdale   text:Randy Ragsdale\n\n\nPlotData =\n width:11\n bar:Canada     from:start      till:10/24/2010 color:lvocals \n bar:Canada     from:start      till:10/24/2010 color:lguitar width:3\n bar:Canada     from:10/01/2024 till:end        color:lvocals \n bar:Canada     from:10/01/2024 till:end        color:lguitar width:3\n bar:Cross      from:start      till:10/24/2010 color:rguitar\n bar:Cross      from:start      till:10/24/2010 color:bvocals width:3\n bar:Cross      from:10/01/2024 till:end        color:rguitar\n bar:Cross      from:10/01/2024 till:end        color:bvocals width:3\n bar:Weidemann  from:start      till:01/01/1998 color:bass\n bar:Weidemann  from:start      till:01/01/1998 color:bvocals width:3\n bar:Plato      from:01/01/1998 till:10/24/2010 color:bass\n bar:Plato      from:01/01/1998 till:10/24/2010 color:lvocals width:3\n bar:Plato      from:10/01/2024 till:end        color:bass\n bar:Plato      from:10/01/2024 till:end        color:lvocals width:3\n bar:Ragsdale   from:start      till:10/24/2010 color:drums\n bar:Ragsdale   from:10/01/2024 till:end        color:drums\n}}\n\n==Discography==\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!
