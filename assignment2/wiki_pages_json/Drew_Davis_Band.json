Eventually, they were transferred to 903 Music, a short-lived record label founded by [[Neal McCoy]]; upon the label's closure in 2007, the band was transferred to [[Lofton Creek Records]]. Both Mike Drake and Jay Hawks have since left the group. The band's debut single, \"Back There All the Time\", entered the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts. It was included on both their self-titled EP and on their 2008 album ''Crossroads''. Roger Malinowski left the band in 2009 to be David Spade's stuntman.\n\nThe Drew Davis Band was featured on an episode of ''[[Gene Simmons Family Jewels]]'' on August 9, 2009.  The episode also featured a guest appearance by [[Trace Adkins]]. They also performed the theme song for the [[Disney Channel]] series ''[[Phil of the Future]]'' and ''[[The Suite Life of Zack & Cody]]''.\n\n==Discography==\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:12em;\"| Title\n! style=\"width:18em;\"| Album details\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Crossroads''\n| \n* Release date: July 8, 2008\n* Label: DELM Records\n|}\n\n===Extended plays===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:12em;\"| Title\n! style=\"width:18em;\"| Album details\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Drew Davis Band'' EP\n| \n* Release date: October 4, 2005\n* Label: Windswept Records\n|}\n\n===Singles===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Year\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:18em;\"| Single\n! colspan=\"1\"| Peak positions\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Album\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n! width=\"60\"| [[Hot Country Songs|US Country]]\n|-\n| 2005\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Back There All the Time\"\n| —\n| align=\"left\"| ''Drew Davis Band'' EP\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 2008\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Back There All the Time\" <small>(re-release)</small>\n| 58\n| align=\"left\" rowspan=\"2\"| ''Crossroads''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"How Do I\"\n| —\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" style=\"font-size:8pt\"| \"—\" denotes releases that did not chart\n|-\n|}\n\n===Music videos===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n!
