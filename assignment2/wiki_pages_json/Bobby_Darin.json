He performed [[jazz]], [[Pop music|pop]], [[rock and roll]], [[Folk music|folk]], [[Swing music|swing]], and [[country music]].\n\nDarin started his career as a songwriter for [[Connie Francis]]. In 1958, Darin co-wrote and recorded his first million-selling single, \"[[Splish Splash (song)|Splish Splash]]\", which was followed by Darin's own song \"[[Dream Lover]]\", then his covers of \"[[Mack the Knife#Popular song|Mack the Knife]]\" and \"[[Beyond the Sea (song)|Beyond the Sea]]\", which brought him worldwide fame. In 1962, Darin won a [[Golden Globe Award]] for his first film, ''[[Come September]]'', co-starring his first wife, actress [[Sandra Dee]].\n\nDuring the 1960s, Darin became more politically active and worked on [[Robert F. Kennedy]]'s Democratic presidential campaign. He was present at the [[Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles)|Ambassador Hotel]] in Los Angeles at the time of [[Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy|Robert Kennedy's assassination]] in June 1968. That same year, Darin discovered the woman who had raised him was his grandmother, not his mother as he thought, and learned that the woman he thought was his sister was actually his mother. Those events deeply affected Darin and sent him into a long period of seclusion.<ref name = \"Starr\">{{cite book|page=167|title=Bobby Darin: A Life|first=Michael Seth|last=Starr|year=2011|publisher=Taylor Trade Publishing|isbn=9781589795983}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Darin made a successful comeback (in television) in the early 1970s, his health was beginning to fail due to a weak heart. The knowledge of Darin's vulnerability had always spurred him on to use his musical talent while still young.

In 1968–69, he wrote and recorded two albums that covered issues such as [[Civil rights movement|civil rights]], poverty, the [[Vietnam War]] and the death of RFK – ''[[Bobby Darin Born Walden Robert Cassotto]]'' (1968) and ''[[Commitment (Bobby Darin album)|Commitment]]'' (1969).<ref>{{Cite web |title=About |url=https://www.bobbydarin.com/about |access-date=2024-05-13 |website=Bobby Darin |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n=== Direction Records ===\nReturning to Los Angeles in 1969, Darin started his own record label which was titled Direction Records, putting out folk and protest music. Darin wrote \"Simple Song of Freedom\" in 1969, which, in an interesting turn of events, was first recorded by Tim Hardin and the song became Hardin's best-selling record. It reached #48 on the ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' Top 100 Singles list in [[Canada]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/028020/f2/nlc008388.6023.pdf| title=RPM Top 100 Singles - August 30, 1969}}</ref> Also in Canada, a version by ''Buckwheat'' reached #52.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/028020/f2/nlc008388.7700.pdf| title=RPM Top 100 Singles - May 6, 1972}}</ref> Darin himself sang the song \"live\" on several television variety shows.\n\nOf his first Direction album, Darin told the press, \"The purpose of Direction Records is to seek out statement-makers....The album is solely {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} compositions designed to reflect my thoughts on the turbulent aspects of modern society.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=DiOrio |first1=Al |title=Borrowed Time: The 37 years of Bobby Darin |date=1981 |publisher=Running Press |location=Philadelphia |isbn=0894711113 |page=181}}</ref>[[File:1972 Bobby Darin show.JPG|thumb|''Dean Martin Presents: The Bobby Darin Amusement Company'', L-R: [[Dick Smothers]], [[Tom Smothers]], and Bobby Darin as the [[Marx Brothers]] (1972) ]]Darin was struggling with his finances as his music career was dwindling. Darin's venture into protest music was not received favorably and generated little or no profits. In late 1969, Darin sold his songs, his record label (Direction Records), and publishing company (TM Music), losing the copyright to his own music and eventually, their worth. The company Darin sold them to went bankrupt. It was believed that during his final days, Darin was still trying to gain back the rights to his music.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== 1970s ===\nIn 1970, Darin proposed a self-directed and written film ''The Vendors'' (1970), about the life of a folk singer.<ref>{{Citation |last=Darin |first=Bobby |title=The Vendors |type=Drama |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0464846/ |access-date=2024-05-13 |others=Mariette Hartley, Donnelly Rhodes, Gary Wood}}</ref> However, the production left him broke and was not released, which led Darin to return to music. In spite of his declining health, Darin's last venture was spent performing live, while undergoing heart surgery and receiving post-treatment medication.<ref name=\":0\" /> He released his last album, self-titled (1972) on [[Motown]].\n\n=== NBC Variety shows ===\nBeginning on July 27, 1972, Darin starred in his own television variety show on NBC, ''Dean Martin Presents: The Bobby Darin Amusement Company'', which ran for seven episodes ending on September 7. Beginning on January 19, 1973, Darin starred in a similar show on NBC called ''The Bobby Darin Show''. That show ran for 13 episodes, ending on April 27. Darin subsequently made television guest appearances and remained a top draw.<ref name=\"Las Vegas\">{{cite web | url=http://www.bobbydarin.net/bdlasvegas.html | title=Bobby in Las Vegas 1960's and 1970's | access-date=October 13, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Sandra Dee\">{{cite news|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20114698,00.html|date=March 18, 1991|access-date=August 16, 2012|volume=35|number=10|first=Sandra|last=Dee|title=Learning to Live Again: A Former Teen Queen Shakes Free of Her Humiliating Past to End Years of Self-Hate and Loneliness|journal=People Magazine|archive-date=September 19, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180919051139/https://people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20114698,00.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== Style and influence ==\nDarin was on par with [[Dean Martin]] and [[Frank Sinatra]].

On occasion, Presley would sneak into Darin's concerts and watch him perform.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn his short life, Darin explored all genres of music, such as pop, jazz, country, and folk music. In a 1988 Rolling Stone interview, [[Neil Young]] confessed: \"I used to be pissed off at Bobby Darin because he changed styles so much.

They were soon in what Darin's friends described as, \"an intense romance\". However, Francis's parents did not approve of Darin and one night after returning from a date, Francis found her bags packed and waiting for her on the front step. Darin proposed almost immediately. When her father found out about the engagement, he stormed into the rehearsals of ''[[The Jackie Gleason Show]]'' with a gun and threatened to shoot Darin, who managed to escape out of a window. Darin and Francis talked briefly after the show, but parted ways.<ref name=\":2\" /> Over a four-month period in 1956, the two maintained a secret correspondence involving love letters. Darin kept the letters until his death, and the letters were auctioned. They were returned to Francis later in life.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Nolasco |first=Stephanie |date=2018-02-08 |title=Connie Francis reflects on her romance with Bobby Darin before his untimely death |url=https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/connie-francis-reflects-on-her-romance-with-bobby-darin-before-his-untimely-death |access-date=2024-05-14 |website=Fox News |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nIn the following years, they saw each other several times while appearing on the same television shows but were never romantically involved again. In 1960, Francis heard on the radio that Darin had married Sandra Dee &mdash; just as she and her father were driving through the [[Lincoln Tunnel]]. Francis later wrote: \"I wished that somehow God would cause the Hudson River to come gushing in and entrap us in that tunnel.\" Francis has said that not marrying Darin was the biggest mistake of her life.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Marriages ===\nDarin married actress [[Sandra Dee]] on December 1, 1960.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=December 2, 1960 |title=Darin, Sandra Dee Married, Fly Here |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/161225834/ |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |page=2 – Part I |access-date=December 28, 2016 |via=Newspapers.com |url-access=subscription}}</ref> They met in [[Rome]], [[Italy]], while filming ''Come September'' (which was released in 1961).<ref>{{cite news |last=Wilson |first=Earl |author-link=Earl Wilson (columnist) |date=December 6, 1960 |title=Never Thought We'd See a Humble Bobby Darin |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/118369054/ |newspaper=The Arizona Republic |page=33 |location=Phoenix, Arizona |access-date=December 28, 2016 |via=Newspapers.com |url-access=subscription}}</ref> It was Dee's mother, Mary Douvon, who convinced the actress to go on a date with Darin.

Darin was frail as an infant and, beginning at age eight, had recurring bouts of [[rheumatic fever]] that left him with a seriously weakened heart.<ref name=\"Sandra Dee\"/> Darin was well aware that he might not live long, and lived his life accordingly.\n\nDuring his first [[heart surgery]] in January 1971, Darin had two [[artificial heart valve|artificial valves]] implanted, then spent most of that year recovering from the surgery.{{citation needed|date=June 2022}} In the last few years of his life, Darin was often administered oxygen during and after his performances on stage and screen.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Death==\nIn 1973, after failing to take antibiotics to protect his heart before a dental visit, Darin developed [[sepsis]], an overwhelming systemic infection, which further weakened his body and affected one of his heart valves. On December 11 of that year, Darin checked himself into [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center|Cedars of Lebanon Hospital]] in Los Angeles for another round of open-heart surgery to repair the two artificial heart valves he had received in January 1971.<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> On the evening of December 19, a four-person surgical team worked for over six hours to repair Darin's damaged heart.

He was only 37 years old.<ref name=ergmtkf/><ref name=\"NYT-Obit\" />\n\nDarin's last wish in his will was that his body be donated to science for [[medical research]], and Darin's remains were transferred to the [[Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center|UCLA Medical Center]] shortly after his death.<ref name=\"NYT-Obit\" />\n\n==Legacy==\nIn 1990, Darin was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], with singer and close friend [[Paul Anka]] announcing the honor.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/bobby-darin/ |title=Bobby Darin: inducted in 1990 &#124; The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum | publisher=Rockhall.com |access-date=August 17, 2015}}</ref> In 1999, Darin was voted into the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]].\n\nSongwriter [[Alan O'Day]] alluded to Darin and his recording of \"Mack the Knife\" in the song \"[[Rock and Roll Heaven]]\" (made a hit by [[the Righteous Brothers]]), a tribute to dead musicians, which O'Day wrote shortly after Darin's death.\n\nOn May 14, 2007, Darin was awarded a star on the [[Las Vegas Walk of Stars]] to honor his contribution to making Las Vegas the \"Entertainment Capital of the World\" and named him one of the twentieth century's greatest entertainers. Fans paid for the star. Darin also has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].\n\nOn December 13, 2009, at its 2010 [[Grammy Awards]] ceremony, the Recording Academy awarded Darin a posthumous Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\n===Biopic===\n{{Main|Beyond the Sea (2004 film)}}\nIn 1986, director [[Barry Levinson]] intended to direct a film based on Darin's life and had begun [[preproduction]] on the project by early 1997. He abandoned the project, the rights to which were subsequently bought by actor [[Kevin Spacey]], along with Darin's son, Dodd. The resultant biopic, ''[[Beyond the Sea (2004 film)|Beyond the Sea]]'', starred Spacey as Darin, with the actor using his own singing voice for the musical numbers. The film covers much of Darin's life and career, including his marriage to [[Sandra Dee]], portrayed by [[Kate Bosworth]].\n\n''Beyond the Sea'' opened at the 2004 [[Toronto International Film Festival]]. Although Dodd Darin, Sandra Dee, and Blauner responded enthusiastically to Spacey's work and the film was strongly promoted by the studio, ''Beyond the Sea'' received mixed-to-poor reviews upon wide release, and box office results were disappointing. Spacey, however, was nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award]] for Best Actor—Motion Picture Musical or Comedy, but the award that year went to [[Jamie Foxx]] for his portrayal of Darin's musical contemporary [[Ray Charles]].\n\n===Musical===\nIn September 2016, ''[[Dream Lover: The Bobby Darin Musical]]'' had its world premiere at [[Sydney Lyric]] Theatre, Australia.
