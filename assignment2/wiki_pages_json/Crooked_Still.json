Former member [[Rushad Eggleston]], who was studying cello at [[Berklee College of Music]], and Liszt, a graduate student at [[MIT]], were playing music together around the same time, and when the four met that summer, they formed a band that became Crooked Still. While its members finished school, the group played various Boston venues, growing in popularity and collecting favorable reviews from the local press.\n\nCrooked Still went on to appear at concert halls, festivals, coffeehouses, and nightclubs in 23 states and several countries. On August 22, 2006, the group released their second album, ''Shaken by a Low Sound''.\n\n=== From 2008 ===\nCellist Rushad Eggleston performed his last show with the band on November 18, 2007, at the [[Iron Horse Music Hall|Iron Horse]] in [[Northampton, Massachusetts]]. He parted ways with Crooked Still to pursue his own music with band [[Tornado Rider (band)|Tornado Rider]].  In January 2008 two new members joined the band: cellist Tristan Clarridge and fiddler Brittany Haas, both of whom have toured in [[Darol Anger]]'s [[Republic of Strings]]. The Darol Anger connection goes further: Rushad Eggleston was in Fiddlers 4 in 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://compassrecords.com/artist/fiddlers-four/|title=Fiddlers 4 - Compass Records}}</ref>  The band released its first album with the new lineup, ''[[Still Crooked]]'' in 2008, a live album in 2009, and ''Some Strange Country'' in 2010.\n\n===2011 and beyond===\nIn honor of their tenth anniversary together as a band, Crooked Still embarked on a major tour of the Northeast and the Pacific Northwest, and released a 7-song EP called ''Friends of Fall'' in October 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://coverlaydown.com/2011/09/a-decade-of-crooked-still/ |title=A Decade of Crooked Still: With an EXCLUSIVE Beatles cover from their upcoming EP |publisher=Cover Lay Down |accessdate=2011-09-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001202518/http://coverlaydown.com/2011/09/a-decade-of-crooked-still/ |archivedate=October 1, 2011 }}</ref> After the final show of their 2011 tour, Crooked Still took a three-year touring and recording hiatus (originally planned to be one year) for its members to pursue other musical projects.\n\nCrooked Still performed at the FreshGrass festival in North Adams, Massachusetts, in September 2017.\n\nIn June 2018, Crooked Still songs \"[[Little Sadie]]\" and \"Ecstasy\" were featured in the gameplay trailer for ''[[The Last of Us Part II]]'' presented at [[E3 2018]].
