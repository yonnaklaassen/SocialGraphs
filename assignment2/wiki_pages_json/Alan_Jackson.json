Originally intended to be a [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] album, ''Like Red on a Rose'' had a different producer and sound. [[Keith Stegall]] was notably absent from this album and, instead, [[Alison Krauss]] took over the producing reins. Unlike Jackson's previous albums, the album abandoned Jackson's typical neotraditional country style and instead, went for a [[soft rock]]/[[adult contemporary]] sound. This move proved controversial for his fans, who accused him of abandoning his signature style in order to go for a more commercial pop route. Although critically acclaimed, the album was considered a commercial disappointment for the singer. For his next album, he went back to his country roots. ''[[Good Time (Alan Jackson album)|Good Time]]'' was released on March 4, 2008. The album's first single, \"[[Small Town Southern Man]]\", was released to radio on November 19, 2007. \"[[Country Boy (Alan Jackson song)|Country Boy]]\", \"[[Good Time (Alan Jackson song)|Good Time]]\", \"[[Sissy's Song]]\" and \"[[I Still Like Bologna]]\", were also released as singles. \"Sissy's Song\" is dedicated to a longtime friend of the Jackson family (Leslie \"Sissy\" Fitzgerald) who worked in their house every day.
