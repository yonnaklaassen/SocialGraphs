Tweedy, originally from [[Belleville, Illinois]], began his music career in high school with his band The Plebes along with [[Jay Farrar]], also in the band. It became the [[alternative country]] band [[Uncle Tupelo]]. \n\nAfter Uncle Tupelo broke up Tweedy formed Wilco which found critical and commercial success, most notably with ''[[Yankee Hotel Foxtrot]]'' and ''[[A Ghost Is Born]]''. The latter received a [[Grammy Awards|Grammy]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album|Best Alternative Album]] in 2005.\n\nDuring his career Tweedy has released 20 studio albums including [[Uncle Tupelo#Discography|four with Uncle Tupelo]], [[Wilco discography#Studio albums|twelve with Wilco]], [[Sukierae|one with his son Spencer]], [[Together at Last|a solo acoustic album]], three solo studio albums, along with numerous collaborations with other musicians, most notably ''[[Mermaid Avenue]]'' with [[Billy Bragg]].<ref name=\"Kot-LHTD-2004\">{{cite book|last1=Kot|first1=Greg|title=Wilco : Learning How To Die|url=https://archive.org/details/wilcolearninghowt00kotg|url-access=registration|date=2004|publisher=Broadway Books|location=New York, N.Y.|isbn=978-0-767-91558-8|edition=1.}}</ref><ref name=\"NYTimes-RockStar-2009\">{{cite news|last1=Carr|first1=David|title=Torture-Free but Still a Rock Star|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/05/arts/music/05carr.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0|access-date=August 20, 2014|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 1, 2009|archive-date=August 21, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140821090505/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/05/arts/music/05carr.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Early life ==\nTweedy was born in [[Belleville, Illinois|Belleville]] on August 25, 1967,<ref name=FamilySearch>{{cite web|title=Jeff S Tweedy: United States Public Records, 1970–2009|url=https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/KL3T-1W8|website=[[FamilySearch]]|access-date=August 20, 2014}}</ref> the fourth child of Bob and JoAnn Tweedy (née Werkmeister).<ref name=SunTimes-GregTweedy-obit-2013>{{cite news|last1=O'Donnell|first1=Maureen|title=Greg Tweedy, 55, railroad man, brother of Wilco founder, dies|url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/obituaries/22315588-418/greg-tweedy-55-railroad-man-brother-of-wilco-founder.html#.U_RUX7xdXXE|access-date=August 20, 2014|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|date=September 2, 2013}}</ref> Bob Tweedy (died August 4, 2017<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/belleville/obituary.aspx?n=robert-l-tweedy&pid=186298161&fhid=4962|title=Robert L.

Tweedy was enraged that Farrar decided to break up the band without notifying him, and this led to a series of harsh verbal exchanges. Farrar and Tweedy agreed to a final Uncle Tupelo tour, but the concerts were marred by the two not participating in each other's songs. The band decided to play Tweedy's \"The Long Cut\" on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'', which further distanced Farrar and Tweedy.<ref name=Kot-LHTD-2004 />{{rp|80–84}} Farrar began to assemble a new band named [[Son Volt]] with Mike Heidorn, bassist Jim Boquist, and his brother Dave Boquist.

Tweedy was indifferent to the idea of working with Bragg, but Jay Bennett's enthusiasm about the idea convinced Tweedy to get the band involved in the project. As a result of Tweedy's feelings on the political nature of some of the lyrics, Bragg recorded mostly political songs while Wilco recorded more neutral songs. Almost all of the songs that appeared on ''[[Mermaid Avenue]]'' and ''[[Mermaid Avenue Vol. II]]'' were recorded over a six-day period in December 1997.<ref name=Kot-LHTD-2004 />{{rp|142–145}} The first ''Mermaid Avenue'' album and a second Golden Smog album (''[[Weird Tales (album)|Weird Tales]]'') were released in 1998, ''Summerteeth'' was released in early 1999, and ''Mermaid Avenue Vol. II'' was released in 2000.

Tweedy chose [[Jim O'Rourke (musician)|Jim O'Rourke]] based on his fascination with O'Rourke's ''[[Bad Timing (Jim O'Rourke album)|Bad Timing]]'' album. O'Rourke offered to bring drummer [[Glenn Kotche]] to the festival, and the trio formed a side project named [[Loose Fur]]. The other band members of Wilco had written a number of songs for ''[[Yankee Hotel Foxtrot]]'', but Tweedy was unsatisfied with them because he believed that the songs did not sound like the ones he played with Loose Fur. Tweedy became such a fan of Kotche's playing style that he decided to dismiss Ken Coomer from the band in favor of Kotche.<ref name=Kot-LHTD-2004 />{{rp|176–183,188}} Tweedy had strong feelings about how songs should be sequenced, which clashed with Jay Bennett's focus on the songs themselves. Because Bennett was mixing the album, this led to a series of arguments between songs about how the album should sound. Tweedy asked O'Rourke to remix several songs on the album that had been mixed by Bennett, which caused tensions within the band to escalate.
