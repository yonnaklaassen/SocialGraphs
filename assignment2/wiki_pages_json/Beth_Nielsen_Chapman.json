Her biggest Canadian hit was \"The Moment You Were Mine\", which reached #23 in 1993.\n\n== Recent recordings ==\nChapman's album ''[[Back to Love (Beth Nielsen Chapman album)|Back to Love]]'' was released in the [[United Kingdom]] on January 25, 2010, and in the United States on May 25, 2010. The album contained 11 new compositions. The single \"Even as It All Goes By\" was [[BBC Radio 2]]'s \"Record of the Week\" for the last week of 2009; it was the only new single added to the \"A list\" of BBC Radio 2's playlist at the end of 2009. \n\nAdditionally, ''Back to Love'' was BBC Radio 2's \"Album of the Week\" beginning on January 18, 2010. The album ''Liv On'' was released on October 7, 2016, for digital download and on CD the next week. It has [[Olivia Newton-John]] and Amy Sky songs about loss and moving on from grief. Chapman, Newton-John, and Sky toured Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, and [[Ireland]] in 2017 in support of the album, performing mainly in smaller, more intimate venues. Her most recent album, ''Hearts of Glass'', was released in 2018 and is available on CD and as a digital download.\n\n== Personal life ==\nChapman has been widowed twice. Her first husband, Ernest Chapman, died of cancer in 1994. The song \"Sand and Water\" was written after Ernest's death; [[Elton John]] performed it during his 1997 world tour.
