In the late 1970s and early 1980s, she had a series of hits on the North American country charts with songs like \"[[Let Me Down Easy (Lobo song)|Let Me Down Easy]]\", \"[[I Just Can't Stay Married to You]]\" and the number one hit \"[[One Day at a Time (song)|One Day at a Time]]\". The latter recording inspired a book of the same name, which was sold on cable television and brought renewed interest to Lane's career.\n\nLane was raised in Peoria, Illinois, and married Lee Stoller at age 19. She raised three children while Stoller worked a sales job in the Peoria area. One day, Stoller overheard his wife singing at home and got the idea that she could become a successful country music vocalist. Stoller soon became her full-time manager and by 1966 she released her first single on a small independent record label. Lane recorded for a series of small labels during the decade with no success. In 1969, Lane and Stoller traveled the far east where she performed over 100 shows for American soldiers fighting in the [[Vietnam War]]. Traumatized by the experience, Lane considered  ending her career but ultimately decided to continue.\n\nThe family moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], in the early 1970s to restart Lane's country singing career. Facing rejection from every major record company, Stoller decided to form his own label, which he named [[LS Records]]. The company began releasing Cristy Lane singles in the mid 1970s. In 1977, she had her first major hit with \"Let Me Down Easy\". It was followed by a series of top ten hits over the next several years. In 1979, Lane signed with [[United Artists Records]], where she would record \"One Day at a Time\". The single would become her biggest hit in her career and prompted Lane to record a series of albums tailored to the Christian market in the 1980s. This included LPs such as ''[[One Day at a Time (Cristy Lane album)|One Day at a Time]]'' (1981) and ''[[Footprints in the Sand (album)|Footprints in the Sand]]'' (1983).\n\nIn 1982, Stoller went to prison on federal bribery charges. The criminal conviction halted Lane's career, but when he was released, he published her biography also titled ''One Day at a Time'' (1983). Marketing the book on cable television in combination with her record albums, ''One Day at a Time'' sold over a million copies. Over the next several decades, Lane's biography and recordings were sold over television commercials, the worldwide web and through other major distributors. In the 1990s, the couple opened a theater in [[Branson, Missouri]], which ran shows for several years.\n\n==Early life==\nLane was born Eleanor Johnston in [[Peoria, Illinois]], to Andrew and Pansy Johnston, one of 12 children.{{sfn|Chaney|Stoller|1983}}<ref name=\"Allmusic\"/> The Johnston family lived in a two-bedroom home located in the nearby town of [[East Peoria, Illinois]]. She was given the nickname, \"Ellie\", by her father at an early age and was called it throughout her early years. During her childhood, Ellie developed an interest with the family's kitchen radio, which often played [[soap opera]]s and popular songs of the era.{{sfn|Chaney|Stoller|1983|p=16}} During her school-aged years, she took a specialized course for a [[Lisp|speech impediment]] that she had developed as a young child.<ref name=\"East Peoria\">{{cite web |last1=Kendall |first1=Jeanette |title=Country/gospel star has roots in East Peoria |url=https://www.eastpeoriatimescourier.com/article/20130515/NEWS/130519778 |website=East Peoria Times Courier |access-date=24 May 2021}}</ref> Ellie was often [[Bullying|bullied]] in school for her lisp and her small stature.{{sfn|Chaney|Stoller|1983|p=24-25}} She eventually graduated from [[East Peoria High School]] in the late 1950s.<ref name=\"East Peoria\"/>\n\nShe was introduced to country music by her husband, Lee Stoller, whom she met in her late teens. Her first country music artists of interest were [[Eddy Arnold]], [[Jim Reeves]] and [[Marty Robbins]].{{sfn|Chaney|Stoller|1983|p=42}} After marrying, the Stollers moved into an apartment in East Peoria before buying a converted garage in the same area with a 50-dollar per month mortgage.{{sfn|Chaney|Stoller|1983|p=42}} The couple soon had three children by 1964.{{sfn|Bufwack|Oermann|2003|p=298}} Now known as Ellie Stoller, she took employment at a printing company in East Peoria, while her husband was employed as a salesman with [[Pepperidge Farms]].{{sfn|Chaney|Stoller|1983|p=50-51}}{{sfn|Bufwack|Oermann|2003|p=298}} In 1965, Stoller overheard his wife singing [[Patti Page]]'s \"[[Tennessee Waltz]]\" and was impressed by her voice. From then on, it was Stoller's idea that she could become a country music singing star{{sfn|Bufwack|Oermann|2003|p=298}} and began encouraging her to perform in front of people.<ref name=\"Allmusic\"/>\n\n==Career==\n===1966–1972: Career launch and touring overseas===\nA first attempt to launch her singing career began when Lee Stoller arranged for a tape to be made of his wife's vocals. The recording was made in the Stollers' living room, with Ellie standing in front of a microphone taped to a chair. Stoller then arranged for a local nightclub owner to visit and hear Ellie sing.{{sfn|Chaney|Stoller|1983|p=66-67}} Ellie's husband believed that she had the talent to become a professional performer, but she suffered from shyness.<ref name=\"Allmusic\"/> After the nightclub organized Ellie's first public performance, she was reluctant to get up on stage. \"What am I doing up here?\" she recalled saying to herself. However, once the band started playing the song [[Paper Roses]],\" she was able to get through the tune. Following her performance, the audience applauded and she performed several more selections that evening.{{sfn|Chaney|Stoller|1983|p=70-71}}\n\nDuring this time, Lee changed her name from Ellie Stoller to Cristy Lane, and had her dye her hair.{{sfn|Bufwack|Oermann|2003|p=298}} However, the pressures of performing publicly caused continued fear and anxiety for Lane. Stoller had her read several self-help books and see a psychiatrist, who gave her tranquilizers.<ref name=\"Allmusic\"/>{{sfn|Bufwack|Oermann|2003|p=298}} Nonetheless, the couple continued her singing career. She continued finding more nightclub work, sometimes changing out of her nightgown to perform last-minute dates.{{sfn|Chaney|Stoller|1983|p=77-78}} She also was given a slot to perform on Chicago's local country music television program titled ''[[National Barn Dance]]''.{{sfn|Bufwack|Oermann|2003|p=298}} The Stollers also opened a pair of nightclubs in the late 1960s where Lane could perform on a regular basis. The first nightclub titled Cristy's Inc. was bought out by a nursing home company. Their second nightclub, The Flame, opened up shortly afterward.{{sfn|Chaney|Stoller|1983|p=115}}\n\nIn 1966, the Stollers took a trip to Nashville where Lane recorded several selections supervised by businessman Cliff Parnum. In her first recording sessions, Lane cut [[Jeanne Pruett]]'s \"Janie Took My Place\". She also cut \"I'm Saving My Kisses\", \"Stop Fooling with Me\" and \"Heart in the Sand\".{{sfn|Chaney|Stoller|1983|p=95}} Yet Lane's songs were rejected by every major country record label. Although Stoller met with major-label producers [[Owen Bradley]] and [[Chet Atkins]], the companies had no interest in his wife. The independent K-Ark Records took interest and signed Lane to a recording contract.{{sfn|Chaney|Stoller|1983|p=95-98}} In 1966, K-Ark issued \"Janie Took My Place\" as her debut single.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lane |first1=Cristy |title=\"Janie Took My Place\"/\"Stop Foolin' with Me\" (7\" vinyl single) |journal=K-ark Records |date=May 1966 |id=686}}</ref> Stoller paid one thousand dollars to manufacture her record and he promoted 500 single records by himself.{{sfn|Chaney|Stoller|1983|p=95}}\n\nLane's early material was described by music writer Greg Adams as a style that \"pointed towards the country-pop sound with which she would eventually find success.{{sfn|Adams|2005|p=1}} Stoller billed her as \"the female [[Jim Reeves]]\" and the \"Sweetest Voice This Side of Heaven\".{{sfn|Bufwack|Oermann|2003|p=298}} Despite his early efforts, Lane's country career did not yield any commercial success.<ref name=\"Allmusic\"/> She recorded several more singles for K-Ark in the mid-1960s and cut material for the Spar and Extremely Brave record labels through 1972. Yet, further material proved unsuccessful.{{sfn|Adams|2005|p=1}}\n\nIn 1969, Lane and her husband traveled to [[Vietnam]] to perform for the American troops stationed there for the [[Vietnam War|war]].<ref name=\"Allmusic\"/> The engagement was planned in a span of two weeks and was nearly cancelled due to the hired band backing out last minute.{{sfn|Chaney|Stoller|1983|p=95}} The 120-concert tour took Lane to the front lines of American combat.{{sfn|Bufwack|Oermann|2003|p=298}} At times, Lane performed despite hearing bombs and fighter jets less than a mile away.{{sfn|Chaney|Stoller|1983|p=125-27}} During other performances, Lane had to shelter in place to avoid being killed.{{sfn|Chaney|Stoller|1983|p=127}} In a car headed to [[Ho Chi Minh City|Saigon]], Lane witnessed the soldier sitting beside her get shot and killed. \"Bullets were ripping through his body, their impact jerking him back. He slumped over the gun he had been strapped to. He was dead,\" Lane's biography book recalled in 1983.{{sfn|Chaney|Stoller|1983|p=129}} Because several shows had to be cancelled, the Stollers lost an estimated twelve thousand dollars during their trip.{{sfn|Bufwack|Oermann|2003|p=298}} Following her return to the United States, Lane recorded her first album titled ''[[Cristy Lane Salutes G.I.'s of Viet Nam]]''. The project was released in 1969 and was dedicated to the soldiers fighting overseas.<ref name=\"Liner Notes\">{{cite journal |last1=Lane |first1=Cristy |title=Cristy Lane Salutes G.I.'s of Viet Nam |journal=Lane Records |date=1969 |id=L-101}}</ref>{{sfn|Adams|2005|p=1}}\n\nLane became increasingly unhappy following her return home from Vietnam. She continued regularly performing at \"The Flame\", but found her schedule too busy and unfulfilling. She was also reliving the experiences of watching warfare day after day.{{sfn|Chaney|Stoller|1983|p=159-64}} In 1970, Lane [[Drug overdose|overdosed]]{{sfn|Bufwack|Oermann|2003|p=298}} on [[Diazepam|Valium]] medication.{{sfn|Chaney|Stoller|1983|p=160}} Following the experience Lane considered the idea of giving up a career in music. However, after contemplating it for several days, she reconsidered. \"I’m not going to let every little thing build up inside me. I’ve got to quit carrying everyone else’s problems—especially my own  family’s—around on my shoulders. I want to go back to singing,\" she said.{{sfn|Chaney|Stoller|1983|p=159-64}} In 1972, the Stollers moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]] in a second attempt to launch Lane's country music career.<ref name=\"Allmusic\"/>{{sfn|Adams|2005|p=1}}\n\n===1972–1981: Breakthrough in country music and \"One Day at a Time\"===\nFollowing their Nashville move, Lee Stoller began learning more about the country music industry to help further Lane's career.{{sfn|Adams|2005|p=1}}{{sfn|Chaney|Stoller|1983|p=169}} He arranged several recording sessions for his wife, paying a reported three thousand dollars per session.{{sfn|Chaney|Stoller|1983|p=169}} He also made regular trips to Nashville where he shopped Lane's material.{{sfn|Adams|2005|p=1}} However, her recordings were rejected by all the major record labels. Ultimately, Stoller decided to form his own record company.<ref name=\"Allmusic\"/> To fund the project, he collaborated in a business venture joining law enforcement on fundraising projects.{{sfn|Chaney|Stoller|1983|p=169-170}} Stoller then established his newly-formed [[LS Records]] in a small office located in [[Madison, Tennessee]]. He also arranged for a photography business to operate from the office.{{sfn|Chaney|Stoller|1983|p=171}} LS began releasing singles by Lane in 1976, starting with a cover of [[Melissa Manchester]]'s \"[[Midnight Blue (Melissa Manchester song)|Midnight Blue]]\".<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lane |first1=Cristy |title=\"Midnight Blue\"/\"The Feeling of Love\" (7\" vinyl single) |journal=[[LS Records]] |date=June 1976 |id=IRDA-068}}</ref> Her next two singles were Lane's first to make the American country charts: \"Tryin' to Forget About You\" and \"Sweet Deceiver\".<ref name=\"Allmusic\"/>\n\nIn 1977, Lane recorded her next single release titled \"[[Let Me Down Easy (Lobo song)|Let Me Down Easy]]\".<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lane |first1=Cristy |title=\"Let Me Down Easy\"/\"This Is The First Time I Saw The Last Time In Your Eyes\" (7\" vinyl single) |journal=[[LS Records]] |date=August 1977 |id=LS-131}}</ref> The song was produced by [[Charlie Black]], a Nashville songwriter, who had also been working as an independent producer.
