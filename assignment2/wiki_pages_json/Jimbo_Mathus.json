Mathis Jr.''' (born August 1967), known as '''Jimbo Mathus''', is an American singer-songwriter, guitarist, and member of the [[gypsy jazz|hot jazz]] band [[Squirrel Nut Zippers]].\n\n==Early life and career==\nHe was born in [[Oxford, Mississippi]] to Jimmy Mathis and Jeanella (Malvezzi) Mathis.  His genealogy is of Scottish and Italian origin.  His early life was filled with music, as his father and relatives were instrumentalists and singers.  He began joining the family musical circle at an early age and by age eight was played mandolin.  By 15, Mathus had been taught the rudiments of guitar, piano and harmony singing.  The family's repertoire consisted of folk, bluegrass, country blues and pre-recorded songs passed down through the Mathus and Byrd families.  His father was an outdoorsman, traveler and also raised hunting dogs and horses.  Thus, Mathus' early life consisted of hunting and fishing in the [[Corinth, Mississippi]], area.{{Citation needed|date=August 2022}}\n\nMathus was involved in [[rock and roll]] in Corinth High School and was recorded first in 1983 at [[Sam Phillips]] Memphis Recording Service in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], in a group called The End.  He also helped found Johnny Vomit & The Dry Heaves, which was one of the first punk rock/experimental noise bands in the state of Mississippi.{{Citation needed|date=August 2022}}\n\nHe left home at age 17 to study philosophy at [[Mississippi State University]] and began writing songs and performing in the Starkville, Mississippi, area.  He was recorded and records released in the mid-1980s under the name Cafe des Moines.  In 1987, Mathus joined the [[United States Merchant Marine|Merchant Marines]] working as a deckhand and tankerman for the Canal Barge Company on the Mississippi, Illinois and Tennessee Rivers.  He used his shore leave to travel the country, usually alone, camping and sleeping in his pickup truck.  Upon a chance trip to North Carolina, he decided to move to the Chapel Hill area.{{Citation needed|date=August 2022}}\n\nEducating himself in the libraries of the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], Mathus learned Latin, studied theater, poetry, First Peoples culture, literature and medieval alchemy, as well as music. It was during this time that he changed the spelling of his last name from \"Mathis\" to \"Mathus,\" to reflect his respect for his and his mother's Latin studies.  He first performed in this area as a drummer, with his group – Metal Flake Mother.{{Citation needed|date=August 2022}}\n\n==Squirrel Nut Zippers==\nIn 1993, Mathus met and married Katharine Whalen. Together they formed [[Squirrel Nut Zippers]].  This group used Mathus' knowledge of theater, early American music and leadership along with Whalen's fashion and vocal style. The group toured throughout the 1990s, appearing at ''[[A Prairie Home Companion]]'', the [[second inauguration of Bill Clinton]], and the [[1996 Summer Olympics]] in [[Atlanta]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Menconi |first=David |title=A Squirrel Nut Zippers opera |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-145748695/squirrel-nut-zippers-opera.html |work=The News & Observer |accessdate=May 14, 2006 |date=May 14, 2006}}</ref> They also performed on television programs ''[[The Tonight Show]]'', ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'', ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' and ''[[Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve]]'' in 1998.

Mathus & His Knockdown Society) Play Songs for Rosetta''.  This was a benefit project to aid Mathus' childhood nanny, Rosetta Patton, daughter of [[Charlie Patton|Charley Patton]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Hal Horowitz|first=Mike Jordan &|title=Charley's Daughter|url=http://charleypatton.4t.com/photo3.html}}</ref> This rekindled Mathus' interest in Mississippi music and set him on a new path.  During this time, Mathus also began recording and producing on his own.\n\nThe Squirrel Nut Zippers disbanded in 2000.  Mathus and Whalen divorced in 2003, at which time Mathus returned to his home state of Mississippi.\n\nSimultaneously, Mathus was gaining recognition for his [[blues]] guitar knowledge through his work with [[Buddy Guy]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Mark Gresser and Big Joe V|title=Interview: James \"Jimbo\" Mathus|url=http://www.mmreview.com/Intviews/2002/JMathus.htm|accessdate=April 26, 2012}}</ref> Mathus toured with Guy off and on from 2001 to 2003. He also recorded with Guy on his album ''Sweet Tea'', and the [[Grammy Award]]-winning album ''Blues Singer''.\n\nMathus started his first studio in his mother's hometown of [[Clarksdale, Mississippi]],<ref>{{cite web |last=Stolle|first=Roger|title=Guide to Today's Delta Blues Musicians |url=http://www.cathead.biz/deltabluestoday.html/ |accessdate=April 26, 2012}}</ref> in 2003. Using antique ribbon microphones and tube pre-amp, Mathus set up Delta Recording Service in the abandoned Alcazar Hotel in downtown Clarksdale and recorded artists there, including [[Elvis Costello]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2022}} In 2007, Mathus relocated the studio to [[Como, Mississippi]].\n\nThrough the mid- to late 2000s, Mathus performed shows in the deep South, mostly in Mississippi.  He became a regular performer at [[Morgan Freeman]]'s [[Ground Zero (blues club)|Ground Zero Blues Club]] in Clarksdale, Mississippi, and acted as bandleader for the [[National Public Radio]] broadcast of \"Toast of the Nation\" on New Year's Eve in 2004.{{Citation needed|date=August 2022}}\n\nIn 2010, Mathus wrote and produced a historical musical revue entitled ''Mosquitoville'', and led the 11-person cast in performances for communities across the state of Mississippi.  He also helped form the South Memphis String Band with longtime collaborators [[Luther Dickinson]] and [[Alvin Youngblood Hart]] and once again signing with a label – Memphis International Records.  In this same year, Mathus married Jennifer White Pierce, an Arkansas actress and writer whose brother – guitarist for Mathus' Tri-State Coalition – had introduced the two.{{Citation needed|date=August 2022}}\n\nMathus and his band, The Tri-State Coalition, released their album ''Confederate Buddha'' on Memphis International Records in May 2011.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hlavaty|first=Craig|title=Jimbo Mathus|url=http://www.houstonpress.com/2012-01-19/music/jimbo-mathus/|accessdate=April 26, 2012}}</ref> In 2012, alongside musician/producer Eric \"Roscoe\" Ambel, Mathus and Tri-State recorded the album ''White Buffalo'' at Delta Recording Services in February 2012.  Mathus later dismantled and closed the studio in March.\n\nMathus released a six-song solo vinyl EP entitled ''Blue Light'' in July 2012 on Big Legal Mess Records.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.honesttune.com/jimbo-mathis-to-release-blue-light-vinyl-ep-this-july/ |publisher=HonestTune.com |title=Jimbo Mathus to release ''Blue Light'' vinyl EP this July |date=May 2, 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303212235/http://www.honesttune.com/jimbo-mathis-to-release-blue-light-vinyl-ep-this-july/ |archivedate=March 3, 2016 |accessdate=June 17, 2012 }}</ref> Mathus and Tri-State's ''White Buffalo'' was released on Fat Possum Records on January 22, 2013.\n\nIn 2014 Mathus released ''Dark Night of the Soul'', a [[southern rock]] album which he described as \"less sepia tone, more ultrachrome.\"<ref>from an interview on [http://americanamusicshow.com/episode188 episode 188 of the Americana Music Show], released April 21, 2014.</ref> He also toured the UK with blues musician [[Ian Siegal]],<ref>{{Cite web|last=bluesdoodle|date=2014-11-29|title=Ian Siegal & Jimbo Mathus @ The Flowerpot, Derby|url=https://bluesdoodles.wordpress.com/2014/11/29/ian-siegal-jimbo-mathus-the-flowerpot-derby/|access-date=2020-07-29|website=bluesdoodles|language=en}}</ref> which led to other collaborations including the ''Wayward Sons'' album and guesting on Siegal's ''Picnic Sessions'' album. He also produced and guested on Siegal's album ''All The Rage'' as well as co-writing some of the songs<ref>{{Cite web|title=Ian Siegal - All The Rage|url=https://www.discogs.com/Ian-Siegal-All-The-Rage/release/11759947|access-date=2020-07-29|website=Discogs|language=en}}</ref>''.''

Mathus attributes the harder sound partly to his new drummer, Bronson Tew, as well as lead guitar appearances from Eric Ambel.<ref>from an interview on [http://americanamusicshow.com/episode249 Americana Music Show #249], published June 2, 2015.</ref>\n\nIn 2021 Mathus released ''[[These 13 (album)|These 13]]'', a collaboration with [[indie rock]] multi-instrumentalist and whistling aficionado [[Andrew Bird]].
