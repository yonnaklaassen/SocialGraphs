Vocalist [[Exene Cervenka]],  singer/bassist [[John Doe (musician)|John Doe]] and drummer [[DJ Bonebrake]] were three of the four members of the [[Punk rock|punk]] band [[X (American band)|X]]; guitarist [[Dave Alvin]] was a member of [[roots rock]] band [[The Blasters]] as well as [[The Flesh Eaters]]; and stand-up bassist [[Jonny Ray Bartel]] was a member of [[blues-rock]] band [[The Red Devils (blues band)|The Red Devils]].<ref name=\"warpedrealitymagazine.com\"/>\n\nThe Knitters' debut album ''[[Poor Little Critter on the Road]]'' was released in 1985. It included mainly traditional and cover songs, together with some X songs performed in an acoustic style. The album drew on blues, folk, country and rockabilly influences.  In 1999, the label [[Bloodshot Records]] released a track-by-track tribute to the album entitled ''Poor Little Knitter on the Road''.<ref> {{cite web|url=http://www.rhino.com/rzine/StoryKeeper.lasso?StoryID=482 |access-date=2007-06-09 | work = Rhino  | title = Rhino Recommends – Rzine No.&nbsp;482 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609223259/http://www.rhino.com/rzine/StoryKeeper.lasso?StoryID=482 |archive-date=2007-06-09 }}</ref>\n\nAfter the debut album's release, all the group members continued to work with their primary bands. Dave Alvin also later pursued a solo career.<ref>{{cite magazine| url = http://harpmagazine.com/reviews/cd_reviews/detail.cfm?article_id=3409 | title =  The Knitters, The Modern Sounds of the Knitters |magazine=[[Harp (magazine)|Harp]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070926231059/http://harpmagazine.com/reviews/cd_reviews/detail.cfm?article_id=3409 |access-date=2007-09-26 | archive-date = 2007-09-26 }}</ref>\n\nTwenty years later, in 2005, the group released their second and ironically-titled album, ''[[The Modern Sounds of the Knitters]]''.
