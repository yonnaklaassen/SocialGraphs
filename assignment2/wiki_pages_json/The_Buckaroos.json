In 2005, [[Country Music Television|CMT]] named the Buckaroos No. 2 on its list of the 20 Greatest Country Music Bands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/shows/dyn/greatest_series/90579/episode_countdown.jhtml |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120724144840/http://www.cmt.com/shows/dyn/greatest_series/90579/episode_countdown.jhtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 24, 2012 |title=TV Shows : Watch Full Episodes Online : Featured Shows, Schedules and Top 20 Video Countdown |website=Cmt.com |accessdate=2017-01-10}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[Don Rich]], [[Doyle Holly]], [[Tom Brumley]] and [[Willie Cantu]] were the original members of the Buckaroos during the 1960s. The 1970s version included Don Rich, Jerry Wiggins, [[Jerry Brightman]], Doyle Curtsinger, and Jim Shaw. Various [[Sideman|sidemen]] throughout the years included [[JayDee Maness]]<!--not \"Jay Dee\"-->, Wayne \"Moose\" Stone, Jay McDonald, Ken Presley, and very early on, [[Merle Haggard]]. Haggard, who worked a short time with Owens in 1962, suggested the group's name.<ref>\"Merle Haggard: The Real Deal\". ''Biography''. A&E TV. November 15, 2000.</ref> Fiddle player [[Jana Jae]] became the group's first female member after being invited onstage with Buck Owens to play \"[[Orange Blossom Special (song)|Orange Blossom Special]]\". Vocalist Victoria Hallman (a.k.a. Jesse Rose McQueen) toured with the Buckaroos, sang with them on Hee Haw and recorded one Buck Owens record \"Let Jesse Rob the Train\" with the group.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} Drummer/singer Rick Taylor replaced Jerry Wiggins in 1978, when he left the band to manage his wife, Susan Raye. Rick performed his first appearance at the Golden Nugget in Las Vegas \"winging it\" as there was no time for rehearsals before the sold-out performances. Rick had seen Buck and the original Buckaroos live in Omaha when he was 13 years old and dreamed of performing with Buck on Hee Haw. At age 19 he made his way to Nashville and 5 years later, he was performing in a rock cover group at a Nashville night club when Buck himself came to watch him at the urging of Hee Haw music director, Charlie McCoy, and Hee Haw staff band players, [[Leon Rhodes]], and Tommy Williams. Buck hired Rick on the spot and invited him to the Hee Haw set the next day where his dream became a reality. Rick's first taping was the Hee Haw 10th Anniversary Show taped at the Grand Ole Opry House in Nashville, Tn in October 1978. He was with the Buckaroos until leaving in 1981, following the band's nomination and win as \"Touring Band of the Year\" at the ACM Awards, to join the Epic Records vocal group Nightstreets, voted Billboard Magazine's Vocal Group of the Year 1981 for the single, \"Love In The Meantime\". Nightstreets featured female vocalist, Joyce Hawthorne, met Rick while recording as a background singer with the Buckaroos in the 1970s. Nightstreets toured with George Jones and Tammy Wynette from 1981 through 1982. Rick retired from the music industry in 1986.\n\nKnown for their signature red, white and blue colored guitars and fiddles, the Buckaroos in 1966 became only the second country music band to appear at [[Carnegie Hall]] in [[New York City]]. The recording of this performance, released as ''[[Carnegie Hall Concert (Buck Owens album)|Carnegie Hall Concert]]'', is considered one of the greatest live country music albums. They also recorded and released live albums from appearances in [[London]], [[Norway]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], and [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]].  The Buckaroos also appeared on the Buck Owens Show.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.buckaroo.xyz/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304025259/https://www.buckaroo.xyz/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=2016-03-04 |title=Home |date= |accessdate=2020-04-12}}</ref>\n\nThe Buckaroos recorded eight albums from 1967 to 1970, all of which were top sellers. They also earned numerous awards, including [[Grammy]]s. They were nominated as \"Band Of The Year\" by the [[Academy of Country Music]] in eight consecutive years, winning the award four times, 1965–1968. The Buckaroos were also nominated as \"Instrumental Group of the Year\" in the Country Music Awards for five consecutive years, 1967–1971, winning the honor in 1967 and 1968.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmaawards.com/2007/database/ArtistDetail.aspx?artistId=764 |title=Homepage - 2016 CMA Awards |website=Cmaawards.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-10}}</ref>\n\nIn 1970, [[Doyle Holly]] received \"Bass Player of the Year\" award from the [[Academy of Country Music]] as a member of the Buckaroos. He left the group the next year to pursue a solo career, in which he released two Top 20 hit albums. He is honored in the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]] and received a block in the walkway of stars at the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] in 1980.
