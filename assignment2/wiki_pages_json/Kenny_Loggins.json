'La Familia,' as my Italian mama used to say.}}{{cbignore}}</ref> They lived in [[Detroit]] and [[Seattle]] before settling in [[Alhambra, California]]. Loggins attended [[San Gabriel Mission High School]], graduating in 1966. He formed a band, The Second Helping, that released three singles during 1968 and 1969 on [[Viva Records (U.S.)|Viva Records]]. [[Greg Shaw]] described the efforts as \"excellent [[punk rock|punky]] [[folk music|folk-pop]] records\" that were written by Loggins who was likely to be the bandleader and singer as well; Shaw included \"Let Me In\" on both ''[[Highs in the Mid-Sixties, Volume 2]]'' and the ''[[Pebbles, Volume 9 (CD)|Pebbles, Volume 9]]'' CD.<ref>Liner notes, Highs in the Mid-Sixties, Volume 2. Ref. August 21, 2008.</ref>\n\nLoggins had a short gig playing guitar for [[The Electric Prunes#The \"New Improved\" Electric Prunes|the New Improved Electric Prunes]] in 1969 before writing four songs for the [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]] that were included on their album ''[[Uncle Charlie & His Dog Teddy]]''.<ref name=POEM>[http://www.poemhunter.com/lyrics/kenny-loggins/biography/ \"Biography: Kenny Loggins\"] Poem Hunter.com</ref> During his early 20s, he was in the band Gator Creek with [[Mike Deasy]]. The first recorded version of \"[[Danny's Song]]\" (later recorded by Loggins and Messina and a No. 7 Hot 100 hit for [[Anne Murray]] in 1973) was included on their only album, released on [[Mercury Records]].\n\n== Loggins and Messina ==\n[[Jim Messina (musician)|Jim Messina]], formerly of [[Poco (band)|Poco]] and [[Buffalo Springfield]], was working as an independent record producer for [[Columbia Records]] in 1970 when he was introduced to Loggins, then a little-known singer-songwriter who was signed to [[ABC Records|ABC-Dunhill]].\n\nThe two recorded a number of Loggins's compositions in Messina's home living room. When Columbia signed Loggins (with Messina's help) to a six-album contract, recording began in earnest for Loggins's debut album, with Messina as producer. He assembled The Kenny Loggins Band by summoning his old friends bassist Larry Sims and drummer Merel Bregante (both formerly of [[the Sunshine Company]], a disbanded 1960s group from Los Angeles), violinist/multireedist Al Garth and multireedist Jon Clarke. Keyboardist [[Michael Omartian]] also played on the album and despite dropping out at the start of the touring, continued to play keyboards on the next two albums. Los Angeles–based session percussionist [[Milt Holland]], described by Messina as an [[ethnomusicology|ethnomusicologist]], also contributed.<ref>{{cite web|last=Flans |first=Robyn |url=http://www.mixonline.com/news/profiles/classic-tracks-loggins-messinas-vahevala/375146 |title=Classic Tracks: Loggins & Messina's \"Vahevala\" |publisher=Mixonline |date=January 9, 2004 |access-date=November 1, 2015}}</ref>\n\nMessina originally intended to lend his name to the Loggins project only to help introduce the unknown Loggins to Messina's well-established Buffalo Springfield and Poco audiences. But by the time the album was completed, Messina had contributed so much to the album in terms of songwriting, arrangement, instrumentation and vocals that an \"accidental\" duo was born. Thus the full name of their first album was ''[[Sittin' In (Loggins and Messina album)|Kenny Loggins with Jim Messina Sittin' In]]''. The album's first single release, the Caribbean-flavored \"Vahevala\", found top 3 success on [[WCFL (AM)|WCFL]] on May 18, 1972.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldiesloon.com/ilc/wcfl051872.htm|title=WCFL – all hit music in the Midwest|date=May 18, 1972|access-date=January 5, 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Kenny Loggins.jpg|thumb|A publicity photo, {{circa|1980}}]]\nAlthough the album went unnoticed by radio upon release, it eventually found success by fall 1972, particularly on college campuses where the pair toured heavily. Loggins and Messina's vocal harmonies meshed so well that what was begun as a one-off album became an entity in itself. Audiences regarded the pair as a genuine duo rather than as a solo act with a well-known producer. Instead of continuing to produce Loggins as a sole performer, they decided to record as a duo, Loggins & Messina.\n\n''\"When our first album, 'Sittin' In', came out, we started receiving a lot of excitement about the music and good sales\"'', Messina recalled in 2005.\n{{Blockquote|text=We had a choice. It was either I now go on and continue to produce him and we do the solo career or we stay together and let this work. For me, I did not desire to go back out on the road. I had had enough of that and I wanted to produce records. But [[Clive Davis]] (then president of the record company) intervened and said, \"You know, I think you'd be making a mistake if you guys didn't take this opportunity. Things like this only happen once in a lifetime. It may merit you sleeping on it overnight and making a decision that will be in your best interest.\" He was absolutely correct. Kenny made the decision as well. It delayed his solo career, but it gave him an opportunity, I think, to have one.<ref name=\"Thibodeaux\">\"Together again: Kenny Loggins and [[Jim Messina (musician)|Jim Messina]] bring their hits to Biloxi\", by Ron Thibodeaux, The Times-Picayune (New Orleans), July 29, 2005.</ref> }}\n\nBoth members of the duo were guitarists: Loggins played rhythm guitar with both acoustic and electric guitar and harmonica and Messina played lead guitar with both acoustic and electric guitar, mandolin and Dobro. Over the next four years they produced five more albums of original material in the studio, plus one album of [[Cover version|covers]] of other artists' material and two live albums. They sold 16 million records and were the most successful duo of the early 1970s, surpassed later in the decade only by [[Daryl Hall & John Oates]].<ref name=\"Thibodeaux\" /> Their work also included [[Lynn Anderson]]'s \"[[Listen to a Country Song (song)|Listen to a Country Song]]\", which was released in 1972 and reached No.&nbsp;4 on the U.S. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Singles]] chart, and \"[[Danny's Song]]\" and \"[[A Love Song (Loggins and Messina song)|A Love Song]]\" for [[Anne Murray]], which reached No.&nbsp;7 and No.&nbsp;12 on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot 100]] pop chart in 1973 and 1974 respectively.  The latter two songs also hit No.&nbsp;1 on the Canadian ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' Top Singles chart. Later studio albums often found Loggins and Messina more as two solo artists sharing the same record than as a genuine partnership. As they both noted in 2005, their collaboration eventually became more a competition. Following their January 1976 release of ''[[Native Sons (Loggins and Messina album)|Native Sons]]'' and a final concert in [[Honolulu]], Hawaii, on September 25, 1976, the pair amicably and quietly parted to pursue solo careers. A greatest-hits album, ''[[The Best of Friends (album)|The Best of Friends]]'', was released in November 1976. Two months later, a live album, ''[[Finale (album)|Finale]]'' was released, more by record company decision than one intended by the artists, one year after the duo had come to an end.{{citation needed|date=March 2024}}\n\n== Solo career ==\n[[File:Kenny Loggins 1977.jpg|thumb|Loggins performing in 1977]]\nIn 1977, Loggins produced his first solo album, ''[[Celebrate Me Home]]'', which included the successful song \"[[I Believe in Love (Kenny Loggins song)|I Believe in Love]]\", originally sung by [[Barbra Streisand]] in ''[[A Star Is Born (1976 film)|A Star Is Born]]''. ''[[Nightwatch (album)|Nightwatch]]'', a popular album released in 1978, included the hit song \"Whenever I Call You Friend\", a duet with [[Stevie Nicks]] of [[Fleetwood Mac]], co-written with [[Melissa Manchester]]. Loggins followed that in 1979 with ''[[Keep the Fire]]'' and in 1982 with ''[[High Adventure]]''. The latter contained his rock duet with [[Journey (band)|Journey]] frontman [[Steve Perry (musician)|Steve Perry]], \"[[Don't Fight It (Kenny Loggins & Steve Perry song)|Don't Fight It]]\", which rose to No.&nbsp;17 on the U.S. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot 100]] chart. Loggins abandoned the harmonica in his solo career but continued to play guitar, just as he had done with Loggins & Messina.\n\n=== With Michael McDonald ===\n{{BLP sources section|date=June 2023}}\nLoggins also co-wrote the song \"[[What a Fool Believes]]\" with [[Michael McDonald (singer)|Michael McDonald]]. Each recorded his own version of it, with McDonald recording as a member of [[the Doobie Brothers]]. Loggins' version was released first, but the Doobie Brothers' version achieved greater success, reaching No.&nbsp;1 on the Hot 100 and earning Loggins and McDonald the 1980 [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] for [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]].\n\nIn 1979, Loggins and McDonald wrote \"[[This Is It (Kenny Loggins song)|This Is It]]\". The song was a love song and ultimatum to a woman having an affair and stringing her lover along, while refusing to make a final decision.  The song earned Loggins the [[Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance]]. [[NBC]] used the song as theme music for its coverage of the [[NCAA men's basketball tournament]] in 1980 and 1981.\n\n=== Soundtracks ===\nDuring the next decade, Loggins recorded so many successful songs for film soundtracks that he became known as the King of the Movie Soundtrack.<ref>[http://www.answers.com/topic/kenny-loggins \"Kenny Loggins\"] Gale Music Profiles</ref><ref>Franko, Vanessa: [http://www.pe.com/localnews/temecula/stories/PE_News_Local_D_loggins04.326bf83.html \"Temecula film fest to honor Kenny Loggins\"] ''Temecula Press-Enterprise'', August 3, 2010</ref> It began with \"[[I'm Alright (Kenny Loggins song)|I'm Alright]]\" from ''[[Caddyshack]]''. Hits followed with \"[[Footloose (song)|Footloose]]\" (his only solo No.&nbsp;1) and \"[[I'm Free (Heaven Helps the Man)]]\" from ''[[Footloose (1984 soundtrack)|Footloose]]''; \"[[Meet Me Half Way]]\" from ''[[Over the Top (1987 film)|Over the Top]]''; and \"[[Danger Zone (song)|Danger Zone]]\" and \"[[Playing with the Boys]]\" from ''[[Top Gun]]''. Loggins also performed [[Nobody's Fool (Kenny Loggins song)|\"Nobody's Fool\"]] for the film ''[[Caddyshack II]]''. He performed as a member of [[USA for Africa]] on the famine-relief fundraising single \"[[We Are the World]]\", which led to an appearance performing \"Footloose\" at the Philadelphia leg of the July 13, 1985, [[Live Aid]] famine-relief dual-venue charity concert and global television broadcast.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://liveaid.free.fr/ |title=The definitive LIVE AID site : all you wanted to know about the greatest concert on Earth |publisher=Liveaid.free.fr |access-date=June 25, 2014}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1990s, Loggins continued his album career, including the popular 1994 children's album ''[[Return to Pooh Corner]]'', which included the title single, a reworking of \"[[House at Pooh Corner (song)|House at Pooh Corner]]\", written for his newborn son Luke.\n\nIn 1991, Loggins recorded and produced ''[[Leap of Faith (Kenny Loggins album)|Leap of Faith]]'', which included the single \"[[Conviction of the Heart]]\". Vice President [[Al Gore]] called this song \"the unofficial anthem of the [[environmental movement]]\". On [[Earth Day]] 1995, Loggins performed at [[The National Mall]] in Washington, D.C., before a live audience of 500,000.\n\nIn 1997, Loggins released the album ''[[The Unimaginable Life]]'', based on a book he co-wrote with his then-wife Julia. Tracks include \"Now That I Know Love\", \"The Art of Letting Go\" and \"One Chance at a Time\". The album was produced by Loggins and [[Randy Jackson]] with background vocals by [[Skyler Jett]], Lamont VanHook and Howard Smith.\n\nIn 1998, Loggins recorded a version of the ''[[Sesame Street]]'' song \"One Small Voice\" for the ABC television special ''[[Elmopalooza]]'', which was included as a track on the Grammy Award-winning [[Elmopalooza! (soundtrack)|soundtrack album]].\n\n=== Other work ===\n[[File:Kenny Loggins-and Boston Pops 2.jpg|thumb|right|Loggins with [[Boston Pops Orchestra]] and conductor [[Keith Lockhart]], June 22, 2011]]\nLoggins scored a No. 1 single on the ''Billboard'' [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|adult contemporary chart]] in 1997 with \"For the First Time\" (his [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-nominated song from ''One Fine Day''). In 2000, he performed the theme song for Disney's ''[[The Tigger Movie]]'', \"[[Your Heart Will Lead You Home]]\", which he co-wrote with [[Richard and Robert Sherman]].\n\nIn 1999, he appeared as himself on the television show ''[[Dharma & Greg]]'' in the episode \"[[List of Dharma & Greg episodes#Season 3: 1999–2000|Tye-Dying the Knot]]\", performing at Abby and Larry's wedding.\nIn 2004, Loggins appeared as himself in episode three, \"Well Well Well,\" of Fox TV's ''[[Method & Red]]''. In 2005, Loggins and Messina gave a nationwide tour that resulted in the CD and DVD ''Loggins and Messina Sittin' In Again''. The tour's concerts were three hours long with an intermission and included an acoustic set in the middle. Complete with a set change that turned the stage into an old gas station setting, the show had a large IMAG video screen that showed old footage of the band, as well as tribute footage of recently deceased former L&M bandmate Jon Clarke. In 2007, Loggins joined the new recording company 180 Music for the release of his album ''[[How About Now]]''. That year he was also inducted into Hollywood's Sunset Boulevard RockWalk.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}\n\nIn 2009, he recorded a new children's album, ''[[All Join In]]'', but it was not released due to complications with his record company. In 2009 Loggins and Messina toured the United States and Canada, reviving their \"Sittin' In Again tour\". In 2011, he performed a short tour in South East Asia including Manila, Philippines and Singapore. On June 3, 2011, he performed at the Arcada Theater in St. Charles, Illinois. He stopped by the Eddie and Jobo Show in Chicago to talk about his music, his personal life and what kind of show you can expect from him.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://khitschicago.radio.com/2011/06/02/hell-be-in-st-charles-tomorrow-but-today-kenny-loggins-is-with-eddie-jobo/ |title=Kenny Loggins Chats With Eddie & Jobo |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819104421/http://khitschicago.radio.com/2011/06/02/hell-be-in-st-charles-tomorrow-but-today-kenny-loggins-is-with-eddie-jobo/ |archive-date=August 19, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThe 2016 parody film ''[[Donald Trump's The Art of the Deal: The Movie]]'' features an original song by Loggins, ''The Art of the Deal'', written specifically for the film.
