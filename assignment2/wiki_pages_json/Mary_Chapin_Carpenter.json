Carpenter spent several years singing in [[Washington, D.C.]]-area clubs before signing in the late 1980s with [[Columbia Records]]. Carpenter's first album, 1987's ''[[Hometown Girl (album)|Hometown Girl]]'', did not produce any charting singles. She broke through with 1989's ''[[State of the Heart (Mary Chapin Carpenter album)|State of the Heart]]'' and 1990's ''[[Shooting Straight in the Dark]]''.\n\nCarpenter's most successful album is 1992's ''[[Come On Come On]]'', which accounted for seven singles and was certified [[Music recording sales certification|quadruple platinum]] in the United States for shipments of four million copies. Her follow up album, ''[[Stones in the Road]]'', appeared two years later and won Carpenter the [[Grammy Award for Best Country Album]], while going double platinum for shipments of two million copies. After a number of commercially unsuccessful albums throughout the first decade of the 21st century, she exited Columbia for [[Zoë Records]]. Her first album for this label was 2007's ''[[The Calling (Mary Chapin Carpenter album)|The Calling]]''. She recorded several albums for Zoë until launching her own Lambent Light label in 2015.\n\nCarpenter has won five [[Grammy Awards]], from 18 nominations, including four consecutive wins in the category of [[Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance|Best Female Country Vocal Performance]] between 1992 and 1995. She has charted 27 times on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Hot Country Songs charts, with her 1994 single \"[[Shut Up and Kiss Me (Mary Chapin Carpenter song)|Shut Up and Kiss Me]]\" representing her only number-one single there.  Her musical style takes influence from contemporary country and folk, with many of her songs including [[feminism|feminist]] themes. While largely composed of songs she wrote herself or with longtime producer [[John Jennings (musician)|John Jennings]], her discography includes covers of [[Gene Vincent]], [[Lucinda Williams]], and [[Dire Straits]], among others.\n\n==Early life==\nMary Chapin Carpenter was born February 21, 1958, in [[Princeton, New Jersey]].<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/mary-chapin-carpenter-mn0000858375/biography | title=Mary Chapin Carpenter biography | work=[[AllMusic]] | accessdate=October 14, 2022 |author=[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] }}</ref> Her father, Chapin Carpenter Jr., was an executive for ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/208015501 | title=Mutual admiration, sisterhood | work=[[The Santa Fe New Mexican]] | date=May 4, 2012 | accessdate=October 14, 2022 | author=Jennifer Levin | pages=38, 39}}</ref> When she was 12 years old, the family moved to [[Tokyo]], Japan, and lived there for about two years, as her father was looking to begin an Asian edition of ''Life''.<ref name=\"price\">{{cite web | url=https://americansongwriter.com/mary-chapin-carpenter-her-songs-are-her-voice/ | title=Mary Chapin Carpenter: Her Songs Are Her Voice | publisher=[[American Songwriter]] | accessdate=October 20, 2022 | author=Deborah Evans Price| date=May 1991 }}</ref> Her mother, Mary Bowie Robertson,<ref name=\"boot\">{{cite web | url=https://theboot.com/mary-chapin-carpenter-mom-dead-dies/ | title=Mary Chapin Carpenter's Mother Dies | publisher=The Boot | date=May 4, 2016 | accessdate=October 14, 2022}}</ref> was a [[folk music]] singer and guitarist.

Erlewine wrote that Carpenter \"found favor on country radio in the 1980s and '90s by taking her emotionally intelligent songs to a mass audience.\"<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> Of her 1980s albums, he stated that \"Country radio was hesitant to play her soft, folky, [[feminism|feminist]] material, but she received good reviews and airplay on more progressive country stations, as well as college radio\".<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> In the ''Virgin Encyclopedia of Country Music'', Colin Larkin noted the use of electric guitar in her more upbeat material such as \"Passionate Kisses\" and \"The Hard Way\", while also referring to \"House of Cards\" as \"thought-provoking\".<ref name=\"virgin\"/> He also stated, \"she, together with the likes of Trisha Yearwood, [[Suzy Bogguss]], and Kathy Mattea, has brought fresh melody to an old and sometimes predictable genre.\"<ref name=\"virgin\"/> Larry Katz of the ''[[Red Deer Advocate]]'' contrasted her with Yearwood and Wynonna Judd, noting that unlike those artists, Carpenter usually wrote her songs herself instead of relying on Nashville-based songwriters.<ref name=\"red deer\"/> Alanna Nash of ''Entertainment Weekly'' thought that by being a graduate of an [[Ivy League]] college, Carpenter \"seemed the least likely female to go the distance on the country charts\".<ref name=\"women\"/> Similarly, Katz thought that her upbringing was atypical of country music, which is more commonly associated with demographics pertaining to the rural [[Southern United States]].<ref name=\"red deer\"/>\n\nNash also noted the difference between \"decidedly noncountry themes like [[Halley’s Comet]] and the spiritual life of old shirts\" in contrast to her more up-tempo material such as \"Down at the Twist and Shout\".<ref name=\"women\"/> In a review of ''Stones in the Road'' for the same publication, Browne contrasted that album with ''Come On Come On'', saying of the latter that \"her square-jawed voice, leaner lyrics, and the sturdy-as-a-wooden-fence folk rock combined to make a deserved[...]breakthrough.\"<ref name=\"stones browne\"/> He also said of her writing style that Carpenter \"sounds like someone who sits down and thinks about it — a lot — before committing it to song. Not since the heyday of [[Gordon Lightfoot]] has a singer-songwriter been so damn reasonable.\"<ref name=\"stones browne\">{{cite magazine | url=https://ew.com/article/1994/10/07/album-review-stones-road/ | title=''Stones in the Road'' review | magazine=Entertainment Weekly | date=October 7, 1994 | accessdate=October 20, 2022 | author=David Browne}}</ref> Mike DeGagne of AllMusic said of Carpenter's lyrics that she \"portray[s] maturely the perils of romance and heartbreak from a female perspective\".<ref name=\"degagne\"/> Writing for ''[[American Songwriter]]'', Deborah Evans Price noted themes of feminism due to many of her songs being about single women attempting to overcome setbacks in her life; of this, Carpenter stated that \"I've just been kind of writing for me.\"<ref name=\"price\"/> Similarly, Nash stated that many of the songs on ''Shooting Straight in the Dark'' featured women protagonists who \"take matters into their own hands\".<ref>{{cite magazine | url=https://ew.com/article/2001/01/25/shooting-straight-dark/ | title=Shooting Straight in the Dark | magazine=Entertainment Weekly | accessdate=October 20, 2022}}</ref> Eli Messinger of Country Standard Time described her singing voice as having \"empathic clarity and force\", particularly on \"Passionate Kisses\" and \"He Thinks He'll Keep Her\". He also stated that the former song had a theme of \"desire\", and the latter a \"call to self-fulfillment\".<ref name=\"eli\"/> Keefe found influences of folk and [[country pop]] in her 1990s albums, but thought that much of her work in the 21st century was \"mixed\" due to a lack of uptempo material and lyrical themes which he considered too similar to each other. He described the stronger tracks on these albums as appealing to [[adult album alternative]] formats.<ref name=\"keefe miracles\"/>\n\n==Personal life==\nCarpenter was unmarried for most of her recording career. In a 1994 profile, Dana Kennedy of ''Entertainment Weekly'' referred to Carpenter as \"a spokes-singer for the thirtysomething single woman\".<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Kennedy |first=Dana |url=https://ew.com/article/1994/11/11/mary-chapin-carpenter-not-so-happy-last/ |title=Mary Chapin Carpenter: Not So Happy At Last |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=November 11, 1994 |access-date=March 28, 2007}}</ref> On June 1, 2002, she married Timmy Smith, a [[general contractor]] then working in [[Batesville, Virginia]].
