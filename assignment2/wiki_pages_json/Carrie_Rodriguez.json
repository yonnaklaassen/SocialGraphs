Her teacher, Bill Dick, remained her principal violin teacher until she left Austin at age 17 to begin music conservatory. When asked why she chose to learn Violin at such a young age, she admits \"I was really bad at nap-time. I would talk through the whole thing. And I already had a parent/teacher conference about it. I remember getting up to go to the bathroom and walking down the hall during nap-time and hearing the little squawky beginner violin playing 'Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star.' And I just remember thinking, 'Oh, man, this is what I should be doing. Not laying in there bored.'\"<ref name=\"huffingtonpost1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-bialas/string-fever-carrie-rodri_b_2524032.html |title=String Fever: Carrie Rodriguez Adds Fuel to the Fiery Fiddle &#124; Michael Bialas |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date=January 22, 2013 |access-date=June 12, 2015}}</ref>\n\nShe was awarded a scholarship to [[Oberlin Conservatory]] and studied under Roland and Almita Vamos for one year (1996).
