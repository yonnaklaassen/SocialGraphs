The quartet was formed in 1955 performing locally, and from 1964 to 1972, they sang as opening act and backup singers for [[Johnny Cash]].<ref>Mike Morsch, ''The Vinyl Dialogues: Stories Behind Memorable Albums of the 1970s as Told by the Artists'' (Biblio, 2014), pp. 73–76. {{ISBN|9781622492077}}</ref>\n\nOriginally performing [[Southern gospel]] music at local churches, the group billed themselves as The Four Star Quartet, and later The Kingsmen.<ref name=\"AmGosp\">{{cite encyclopedia\n | editor = W.

Despite the name, only two members of the group (Don and Harold Reid) were actual brothers and no member had the surname of Statler. The group actually named themselves after a brand of [[facial tissue]] they had noticed in a hotel room (they later quipped that they could just as easily have named themselves \"the [[Kleenex]] Brothers\").<ref name=\"Stamler\">{{cite encyclopedia\n | editor = Irwin Stamler & Grelund Landon\n | encyclopedia = Country Music: The Encyclopedia\n | title = The Statler Brothers\n | year = 1997\n | publisher = Macmillan\n | location = New York\n | isbn = 0-312-26487-9\n | pages = 459\n}}</ref> Don Reid sang [[lead singer|lead]]; Harold Reid, Don's older brother, sang [[Bass (voice type)|bass]]; Phil Balsley sang [[baritone]]; and [[Lew DeWitt]] sang [[tenor]] and was the [[guitarist]] before being replaced due to ill health by [[Jimmy Fortune]] in 1981.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://countrymusichalloffame.org/artist/the-statler-brothers/ |title=The Statler Brothers |publisher=[[Country Music Hall of Fame]]}}</ref>\n\nThe band's style was closely linked to their gospel roots. \"We took gospel harmonies,\" said Harold Reid, \"and put them over in country music.\"<ref name=\"AmGosp\" /> Most of their albums contain at least one gospel song, and they produced several containing only gospel. They also recorded a tribute song to [[The Blackwood Brothers]], who influenced their music. The song \"We Got Paid by Cash\" was written by the Statler Brothers as a tribute to Johnny Cash, who discovered and mentored them.<ref name=\"AmGosp\" />\n\n== Career ==\nEarly in the group's history, before the group named themselves The Statler Brothers, Joe McDorman was their lead singer.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/1985/11/17/lew-dewitt-after-illness-and-despair-a-statler-brother-makes/|title=Lew Dewitt: After Illness And Despair, A Statler Brother Makes|date=November 17, 1985 |url-status=live|archive-url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20140109112845/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1985-11-17/entertainment/8503190341_1_jimmy-fortune-phil-balsley-harold-reid|archive-date=January 9, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe Statlers began their career at a performance at Lyndhurst Methodist Church near their hometown of Staunton, Virginia, under the name The Four Star Quartet.<ref name=\"AmGosp\" /> In 1964, they started an eight-year run as Johnny Cash's opening act and backing vocalists.<ref name=\"Stamler\" /> This period of their career was memorialized in their song \"We Got Paid by Cash.\" They were featured regularly on ''[[The Johnny Cash Show]]'', his [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] hit show that ran from 1969 to 1971. Due to their expanding career, the Statlers left Cash's entourage around the mid-1970s to concentrate on their own career, a departure that took place on good terms.\n\nTwo of the Statlers' best-known songs are \"[[Flowers on the Wall]],\" their first major hit that was composed and written by Lew DeWitt, and the socially conscious \"[[Bed of Rose's]]\". In the 1980s, the Statlers were a mainstay on [[Spike TV|The Nashville Network (TNN)]], where their videos were shown regularly. Also on TNN, between 1991 and 1998, they hosted ''[[The Statler Brothers Show]]'', a weekly [[variety show]], which was the network's top-rated program for its entire 7-year run.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gmacanada.ca/go/site/news/2007/09/ |title=Biography |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214092844/http://www.gmacanada.ca/go/site/news/2007/09/ |archive-date=December 14, 2007 |website=Rex Allen, Jr.'s official website |access-date=April 18, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1995-01-07-9501070171-story.html |title=Statler Bros.'

They recorded two comedy albums under the [[pseudonym]] Lester \"Roadhog\" Moran and the Cadillac Cowboys, and one-half of one side of the album ''Country Music Then and Now'' was devoted to satirizing small-town radio stations' Saturday-morning shows.\n\nThe Statlers earned the number-one spot on the [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' chart]] four times, for \"[[Do You Know You Are My Sunshine]]?\" in 1978, \"[[Elizabeth (The Statler Brothers song)|Elizabeth]]\" in 1984, and in 1985, \"[[My Only Love (song)|My Only Love]]\" and \"[[Too Much on My Heart]].\"<ref name=\"CMT\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/statler_brothers/bio.jhtml |title=Artist Biography: The Statler Brothers |access-date=April 17, 2008 |work=[[Country Music Television]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080325074504/http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/statler_brothers/bio.jhtml |archive-date=March 25, 2008}}</ref> Since forming, the Statlers have released over 40 albums.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://thestatlerbrothers.com/discography/ |title=Discography |website=The Statler Brothers' Official website |access-date=June 1, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://statlerbrothers.com/ |title=The Statlers |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509155220/http://statlerbrothers.com/ |archive-date=May 9, 2008 |access-date=April 10, 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn 1980, the Statler Brothers purchased and renovated their former elementary school, Beverly Manor, in Staunton, occupying the complex for several years. The complex consisted of offices for the group, a small museum and auditorium, and an adjacent building that served as office space for unrelated businesses. A garage was built to store the two tour buses that the group had used for many years. The group has since sold the complex, which Grace Christian Church in Staunton converted back into an academic campus.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gcswarriors.org/contact-us/directions.cfm |title=Elementary/Middle School Directions |website=Grace Christian School |access-date=June 1, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 1970, the group began performing at an annual [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] festival in Gypsy Hill Park in Staunton. The event, known as \"Happy Birthday USA,\" lasted for 25 years, and included many country-music figures, including [[Mel Tillis]], [[Charley Pride]], and many others. The event drew as many as 100,000 fans each year. The group also honored their hometown with the song \"Staunton, Virginia\" on their 1973 album ''Do You Love Me Tonight''.\n\nDeWitt retired from the Statler Brothers in 1982 due to ill health. After a 3-year hiatus, he returned to the music industry as a solo artist until shortly before his death on August 15, 1990, from complications of [[Crohn's disease]], at age 52.<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE0D9133EF934A2575BC0A966958260 \"Lew DeWitt, 52, Tenor With the Statler Brothers\"].
