The band consisted of [[Brady Seals]] (lead vocals), Keith Horne (bass guitar), Trey Landry (drums), and [[Mark Matejka]] (guitar). Matjeka was replaced in 2006 by Kevin Ray. Seals was initially co-lead vocalist and keyboardist of [[Little Texas (band)|Little Texas]] until 1994. Signed to [[DreamWorks Records]] Nashville in 2005, Hot Apple Pie released its [[Hot Apple Pie (album)|self-titled debut album]] that year. This album produced three chart singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts, including the No.&nbsp;26-peaking \"Hillbillies.\"\n\n==History==\nBrady Seals was a keyboardist and co-lead vocalist (alongside [[Tim Rushlow]]) in the country band [[Little Texas (band)|Little Texas]] until late 1994, when he left in pursuit of a solo career.<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p702108/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Hot Apple Pie biography |accessdate=2008-04-04 |last=Monger |first=James Christopher |work=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> Between then and the early 2000s, Seals recorded three albums, and charted six singles on the country charts.\n\nAfter deciding that his solo career was not proving successful, Seals opted to form a second band. Guitarist [[Mark Matejka|Mark \"Sparky\" Matejka]] and drummer Trey Landry, both of whom had backed Seals during his solo career, were recruited, with bass guitarist Keith Horne completing the lineup.<ref name=\"cmt\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1505443/hot-apple-pie-leaves-the-oven.jhtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080926120225/http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1505443/hot-apple-pie-leaves-the-oven.jhtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 26, 2008 |title=Hot Apple Pie Leaves the Oven |accessdate=2008-04-04 |last=Morris |first=Edward |work=[[Country Music Television]]}}</ref> These three musicians all had experience prior to the band's foundation.
