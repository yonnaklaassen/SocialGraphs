She began her career in the 1980s as a solo singer. In the 1990s, six of her songs were Top 10 hits, three albums were certified gold, and one album received a platinum certification. She won Top New Female Vocalist from the [[Academy of Country Music]] and the Horizon Award from the  [[Country Music Association]].\n\n==Early life and rise to success==\nSusan Kay Bogguss<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.suzybogguss.com/bio|title=BIO|website=Suzybogguss.com|access-date=October 17, 2019}}</ref> was born on December 30, 1956, in [[Aledo, Illinois]], United States, the youngest of four born to Barbara \"B.J.\" (née Stewart) and Charles \"Bud\" Bogguss.

She graduated from ISU in 1980 with a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[metalsmithing]]. She would later use these skills to design her own jewelry.\n\nBogguss later recalled of her interest in music, \"Being from a small town I didn’t realize that somebody had to make this stuff.

The LP was available for purchase at her shows and is now a rare collector's item. In 1984, while touring at the Huntley Lodge resort in Montana, Bogguss discovered that she spent most of her money on clothes for her later shows. She also realized that she had no health insurance, very little car insurance, and low chances of performing further, and there were no talent scouts.<ref name=\"SOS1\">{{cite news|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/1987/07/19/secret-of-success/|title=Secret Of Success|last=Hurst|first=Jack|page=1|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=July 19, 1987|access-date=May 31, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"OS\"/>\n\nAfter moving to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], in 1985,<ref name=\"SOS1\"/><ref name=\"OS\"/><ref name=\"Herald-Mail\"/> Bogguss began working at the local [[Tony Roma's]] restaurant on her first day there.<ref name=\"WashingtonPostInterview2007\">{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/29/AR2007112900892.html|title=Keeping Her Options Open|last=Harrington|first=Richard|newspaper=Washington Post|date=November 30, 2007|access-date=June 2, 2013}}</ref> While there, she performed a three-day audition for entertainer [[Dolly Parton]] at Silver Dollar City, a theme park which would eventually become [[Dollywood]].<ref name=\"WashingtonPostInterview2007\"/> The following year, she became the first featured female performer at the park, playing four solo shows at the park's train station and appearing in the \"Jamboree\" show.

Two of these singles succeeded in making the lower reaches of the Billboard country music charts. Her debut studio album for Capitol, ''[[Somewhere Between (album)|Somewhere Between]]'' was released in March 1989. ''Somewhere Between'', with its blend of traditional and contemporary styles, drew positive reviews from critics. The album's second single, \"Cross My Broken Heart,\" became a top-20 hit on the country music charts. The same year, Bogguss won the award for Top New Female Vocalist by the [[Academy of Country Music]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://apnews.com/e55633900c6bceb10404c1c6a0b3be43|title=Winners of the 24th Annual Academy of Country Music Awards With PM-Country Awards|location=Burbank, California|work=Associated Press News|date=April 11, 1989|access-date=May 30, 2013}}</ref>\n\nFor her second album, ''[[Moment of Truth (Suzy Bogguss album)|Moment of Truth]]'', production tasks were taken over by new label-head and Nashville producer [[Jimmy Bowen]], who moved Bogguss's sound in a more polished direction. However, the album's two singles failed to rise beyond the lower reaches of the Billboard charts. A duet she recorded with [[Lee Greenwood]], \"Hopelessly Yours,\" went to No.&nbsp;12 on the country singles chart and received a [[Grammy Award]] nomination for Best Country Vocal Collaboration.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nIn 1991 Bogguss released her third studio album, the platinum-selling ''[[Aces (Suzy Bogguss)|Aces]]''. The LP yielded four hit singles - \"[[Someday Soon (Ian Tyson song)|Someday Soon]]\", \"[[Outbound Plane]]\", \"[[Aces (song)|Aces]]\", and \"[[Letting Go (Suzy Bogguss song)|Letting Go]]\", the latter three reaching the country Top Ten. At the 1992 [[Country Music Association]] Awards Bogguss won the Horizon Award.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/1992/10/11/bogguss-victory/|title=Bogguss Victory|last=Hurst|first=Jack|date=October 11, 1992|location=Nashville|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|access-date=May 31, 2013}}</ref> In September of that year, Bogguss began designing women's leather apparel; the apparel was sold in stores on the West Coast.<ref name=\"PPGInterview\"/>\n\nHer 1992 follow-up, ''[[Voices in the Wind]]'', earned Bogguss her second straight gold record. The album's first single, a cover of the 1988 song \"[[Drive South]]\" by [[John Hiatt]], missed the No.&nbsp;1 spot but gave Bogguss the highest-charting hit of her career to date. Her streak continued the following year with another gold record, ''[[Something Up My Sleeve]]'', giving her two additional Top Five hits in \"[[Just Like the Weather]]\" and \"[[Hey Cinderella]]\". The latter, which she cowrote with [[Matraca Berg]] and Gary Harrison, has gone on to become one of Bogguss's [[signature song]]s. In May 1993, Bogguss appeared on the CBS television special ''The Women of Country''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-04-27-ca-27667-story.html|title=Morning Report - Television|last=Snow|first=Shauna|date=April 27, 1993|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=May 30, 2013}}</ref>\n\nEventually, Bogguss became the sole producer of her sixth studio album, ''[[Simpatico (Atkins/Bogguss)|Simpatico]]''. The album consisted of duets with long-time friend and guitarist [[Chet Atkins]]. The album was released in 1994, and though it was generally well reviewed, its only single, \"One More for the Road,\" did not chart. That same year, Bogguss's ''[[Greatest Hits (Suzy Bogguss)|Greatest Hits]]'' album was released and went gold. Later, Bogguss collaborated with [[Alison Krauss]], [[Kathy Mattea]], and [[Crosby, Stills, and Nash]] to contribute \"[[Teach Your Children]]\" to the [[AIDS]] benefit compilation album [[Red Hot + Country]] produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]].\n\nUpon completing ''Simpatico'', Bogguss temporarily set her music aside to start a family. Bogguss and Crider's first child, Benton Charles Crider, was born on March 17, 1995.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://apnews.com/cbd7afd6499405460729c28196499064|title=People in the News|date=March 20, 1995|work=Associated Press News|access-date=June 1, 2013}}</ref> She also scaled down her touring dates as a result for three years.<ref name=\"Herald-Mail\"/> In May of that year, Bogguss performed at the [[White House]] with [[Kathy Mattea]] and [[Alison Krauss]].

During her break, the climate of country music had changed considerably, with more pop-oriented female singers such as [[Martina McBride]], [[Faith Hill]], and [[Shania Twain]] dominating the charts. Bogguss's traditional, straightforward style failed to connect with younger listeners, and the record yielded low sales. In March 1997, Bogguss performed at the Every Woman's Challenge charity concert, which was held at the [[Palm Springs Convention Center]] in California.<ref name=\"LATInterview\"/>\n\nAfter her next album, 1998's ''[[Nobody Love, Nobody Gets Hurt]]'', also proved unsuccessful, Bogguss was dropped from Capitol. On February 18, 1999, Bogguss issued the following statement:\n\n{{cquote|I had a great tenure with Capitol, during which I weathered a lot of changes in both personnel and philosophy. From [[Jim Foglesong]] to [[Pat Quigley]] and everyone in between, I appreciate having been a part of the Capitol family. We celebrated a lot of successes together, including Grammy nominations, hit records, and platinum albums. I have a number of projects on my plate right now. This gives me the freedom to pursue those opportunities.}}\n\n==Indie label recording career==\n\nFollowing her departure from Capitol, Bogguss signed with Nashville-based fledgling label Platinum Records, headed by former Capitol executive George Collier.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/news-in-brief/1475850/bogguss-goes-platinum.jhtml|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130628214538/http://www.cmt.com/news/news-in-brief/1475850/bogguss-goes-platinum.jhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 28, 2013|title=Bogguss Goes Platinum|date=May 28, 1999|publisher=CMT|access-date=May 31, 2013}}</ref> Within three months, she had released her self-titled ninth studio album, ''Suzy Bogguss''. Once again, the album was commercially unsuccessful, with her only single \"Goodnight\" making an appearance on the country charts.\n\nIn 2001, Bogguss founded her own record label, Loyal Dutchess. The label's first album, ''Live at Caffé Milano'', documents three separate 1999 performances at the Caffé Milano in Nashville. This release is only available for purchase at Bogguss's official website. In November 2001, she released the holiday album, ''Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas'', a compilation of new and previously available material included through a special licensing agreement with Capitol.<ref name=\"Hartford Courant\">{{cite news|url=https://www.courant.com/2001/12/13/bogguss-fanatic-about-christmas/|title=Bogguss: Fanatic About Christmas|last=Catlin|first=Roger|date=December 13, 2001|work=Hartford Courant|access-date=June 2, 2013}}</ref> In addition to being available at her website, the album was also offered through [[Amazon.com]], select retailers, and at her live performances.\n\nIn March 2003, Bogguss and Loyal Dutchess Records signed a deal with [[Compadre Records]]. Her first release on this label was the [[Western swing]] album, ''Swing'', that she had been recording with producer [[Ray Benson]], the bandleader of Western swing group [[Asleep at the Wheel]]. Although the album saw only lukewarm sales (it reached No.&nbsp;6 on the jazz album charts, but failed to appear on the Billboard 200), it was well received by critics. Bogguss' next album, ''Sweet Danger'', was released in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1570099/suzy-bogguss-finds-herself-in-sweet-danger.jhtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509115504/http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1570099/suzy-bogguss-finds-herself-in-sweet-danger.jhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 9, 2008|title=Suzy Bogguss Finds Herself in Sweet Danger|last=Shelburne|first=Craig|publisher=CMT|date=September 19, 2007|access-date=May 23, 2013}}</ref> The album peaked at No.&nbsp;4 on the jazz charts.

The album consisted of renditions of several American folk songs, such as \"[[Red River Valley]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/news-in-brief/1668342/suzy-bogguss-john-hiatt-release-new-albums.jhtml|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130628214933/http://www.cmt.com/news/news-in-brief/1668342/suzy-bogguss-john-hiatt-release-new-albums.jhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 28, 2013|title=Suzy Bogguss, John Hiatt Release New Albums|date=August 2, 2011|publisher=CMT|access-date=May 23, 2013}}</ref>  In addition to the CD, Bogguss and husband Doug Crider also produced a companion hard cover song book that included lyrics, sheet music, and a short history of each song.  A paperback version of the songbook became available in 2015.\n\nIn February 2014 Bogguss released ''Lucky'' a collection of songs written by Merle Haggard.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://shorefire.com/releases/entry/suzy-bogguss-recasts-merle-haggard-classics-with-lucky-feb-4|title=Suzy Bogguss Recasts Merle Haggard Classics With \"Lucky\" Feb 4|website=Shorefire.com|access-date=October 17, 2019}}</ref> To partially fund the promotion of the album she created a very successful Kickstarter crowd funding campaign which raised over $75,000 with the participation of nearly 1000 contributors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/suzybogguss/suzy-bogguss-her-new-album-lucky|title=Suzy Bogguss: her new album, \"Lucky\"|website=Kickstarter.com|access-date=October 17, 2019}}</ref> The album was promoted through the Americana format and was well received.\n\nDuring the summer of 2016, Bogguss conducted a celebration via her Suzy Bogguss Music Facebook page, of the 25th anniversary of the release of her Platinum selling Aces Album in 1991.  Aces also was her break out album which brought her serious attention on Country Radio and secured her future on Capitol Nashville for several more albums.  On August 18, 2016, the actual 25th anniversary of the release of the original Aces album, she released a new re-imagined and rerecorded version of the album entitled ''Aces Redux''. A release party and concert was held that night at the \"3rd and Lindsley\" venue in Nashville. ''Aces Redux'' was recorded with the help of a number of the musicians that have toured with Bogguss over the years and included background vocals by friends [[Beth Nielsen Chapman]] and [[Kim Carnes]] along with several others.   The album takes a more acoustic and simpler production tack than the original which also reflects her more recent touring approach as a trio with Charlie Chadwick on standup Bass and Craig Smith on lead guitar.\n\nBogguss's 17th studio album, ''Prayin' for Sunshine'', was released on November 3, 2023. It marks the first time she is credited as a writer of all songs on one of her albums. [[MusicRow]] said the album \"captures the unvarnished essence of southern storytelling and the authentic roots of Americana music.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://musicrow.com/2023/11/new-suzy-bogguss-project-prayin-for-sunshine-out-now/|title=New Suzy Bogguss Project 'Prayin' For Sunshine' Out Now|website=www.musicrow.com|date=3 November 2023 |access-date=November 6, 2023}}</ref> In a review for the lead single, \"It All Falls Down to the River\", [[American Songwriter]] called the song \"a lyrical gut-punch, shining a light on hard truths about life in the United States.
