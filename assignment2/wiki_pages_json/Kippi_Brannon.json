She made her debut on the country music scene as a teenager, releasing four singles on [[MCA Records]] in the early 1980s before leaving her career in favor of a college education. By 1992, she returned to the country music scene, eventually releasing her debut album ''I'd Be with You'' in 1997.<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p184539|pure_url=yes}} |title=Kippi Brannon Biography |accessdate=2007-12-23 |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |work=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nKippi Rolynn Binkley was born in [[Nashville, Tennessee]].<ref name=\"oldies\"/> A singer and musician at an early age, she began singing professionally before she was a teenager. At age 12, she gave a performance at a local shopping mall, when an executive for [[MCA Records]] discovered her.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/><ref name=\"coast\"/> With the help of record producer Chuck Howard, Jr., Kippi was signed to MCA in 1981. Her surname was altered to Brannon, after Brannon Auto Parts, a local automotive parts store.<ref name=\"oldies\"/><ref name=\"allmusic\"/>\n\n==Career==\nBrannon charted three singles in the early 1980s, in addition to receiving a New Female Vocalist of the Year nomination from the [[Academy of Country Music]].<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> She was also signed as an opening act for other country artists. Although she was gaining in popularity, Brannon decided to leave her career and attend college, first at [[Belmont University]] and later at the [[University of Tennessee]]-Knoxville.<ref name=\"oldies\"/> During her hiatus from the country music scene, she also married and had a daughter, Kasey;<ref name=\"coast\">{{cite web |url=http://archive.southcoasttoday.com/daily/05-97/05-28-97/c04ae214.htm |title=Still \"Daddy's Little Girl\": Former teen star Kippi Brannon returns to country music |accessdate=2007-12-23 |last=Patterson |first=Jim |date=1997-05-28 |work=South Coast Today}}</ref> she later divorced and married a second time.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/>\n\nBy 1988, Brannon resumed her music career, signing to [[Curb Records]] this time around. Her first single for the label, \"I Ain't Never\", failed to make the charts upon its 1992 release. Working with producers [[Matt Rollings]] and [[James Stroud]], she began a search for additional songs to record; however, by the end of 1992, she once again had to take a hiatus, as she had divorced a second time, and had to care for her ailing father.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> \n\nHer first album, ''I'd Be with You'', was released in early 1997, under the production of [[Mark Bright (record producer)|Mark Bright]].<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> Though the album's first single, \"Daddy's Little Girl\", only reached number 42 on Billboard's [[Hot Country Songs]] chart -- which tracked only radio airplay at the time -- it was a retail success, spending 23 weeks and reaching number 6 on the Country Single Sales chart, and number 23 on the 1997 year-end Country Single Sales chart.<ref>{{cite web |title=Billboard-1997-12-27 |url=https://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-All-Music/Billboard/90s/1997/Billboard-1997-12-27.pdf |website=World Radio History}}</ref> The song was also blended with fellow [[Curb Records]] artist [[Jeff Carson]]'s solo recording of [[Bob Carlisle]]'s similarly-themed hit single \"[[Butterfly Kisses (song)|Butterfly Kisses]]\" as an additional track on Carson's [[Butterfly Kisses (Jeff Carson album)|album of the same name]]. Like Brannon's single, Carson's version of \"Butterfly Kisses\" struggled on the airplay charts but was a sales success, spending 15 weeks on the Country Single Sales chart and peaking at number 6. ''I'd Be with You'' reached number 53 on the [[Top Country Albums]] chart.\n\nBrannon has not recorded since.\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:10em;\"| Title\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:16em;\"| Album details\n! colspan=\"2\"| Peak chart<br />positions\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n! width=\"45\"| [[Top Country Albums|US Country]]\n! width=\"45\"| [[Top Heatseekers|US Heat]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''I'd Be with You''\n| \n* Release date: April 22, 1997\n* Label: [[Curb Records|Curb]]/[[Universal Records|Universal]]\n| 53\n| 48\n|}\n\n===Singles===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Year\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:18em;\"| Single\n! colspan=\"2\"| Peak chart<br />positions\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Album\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n! width=\"45\"| [[Hot Country Songs|US Country]]\n! width=\"45\"| [[Bubbling Under Hot 100|US Bubbling]]\n|-\n| 1981\n! scope=\"row\"| \"[[Slowly (Webb Pierce song)|Slowly]]\"\n| 37\n| —\n| rowspan=\"4\" {{n/a}}\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 1982\n! scope=\"row\"| \"If I Could See You Tonight\"\n| 55\n| —\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"He Don't Make Me Cry\"\n| 87\n| —\n|-\n| 1983\n! scope=\"row\"| \"In My Dreams\"\n| —\n| —\n|-\n| 1992\n! scope=\"row\"| \"[[I Ain't Never]]\"\n| —\n| —\n| align=\"left\" rowspan=\"4\"| ''I'd Be with You''\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\"| 1997\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Daddy's Little Girl\"\n| 42\n| 20\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"I'd Be with You\"\n| 53\n| 20\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"The Greatest Love I've Ever Known\"<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://americanradiohistory.com/Archive-RandR/1990s/1997/RR-1997-11-07.pdf|title=Going for Adds|journal=[[Radio & Records]]|page=65|date=November 7, 1997}}</ref>\n| —\n| —\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" style=\"font-size:8pt\"| \"—\" denotes releases that did not chart\n|-\n|}\n\n===Music videos===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n!
