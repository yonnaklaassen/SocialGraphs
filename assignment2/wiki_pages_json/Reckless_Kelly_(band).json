The band relocated to [[Austin, Texas]] in October 1996.\n\n==History==\nLed by brothers Willy (vocals/guitar) and Cody Braun (vocals/fiddle/mandolin/harmonica), the alternative country-rock outfit Reckless Kelly formed in Stanley, Idaho in February 1996 before moving to Austin, Texas. The Brauns had previously toured with their father in Muzzie Braun & the Boys, a Western swing band, and were joined in their own group by the lead guitarist Casey Pollock, the bass guitarist Chris Schelske and the drummer Jay Nazz.\n\nWith their younger brothers Micky and Gary, Cody and Willy were raised in [[central Idaho]] near the [[Sawtooth Range (Idaho)|Sawtooth Mountains]], between [[Clayton, Idaho|Clayton]] and [[Challis, Idaho|Challis]] in [[Custer County, Idaho|Custer County]], and were homeschooled by their mother. Originally they were \"Muzzie Braun & the Little Braun Brothers\", as Muzzie and his brothers Gary and Billy were the \"Braun Brothers\" from [[Twin Falls, Idaho|Twin Falls]] in the 1970s and early 1980s, sons of the musician Eustaceus \"Mustie\" Braun.<ref name=bbhra>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=eJVfAAAAIBAJ&sjid=JDEMAAAAIBAJ&pg=3614%2C1990319 |work=Lewiston Morning Tribune |location=(Idaho)|last=McCarthy |first=John |title=Braun Brothers hit the road again for tour |date=June 22, 1990 |page=1D}}</ref><ref name=lntobitmmb81>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=tJxfAAAAIBAJ&sjid=tjEMAAAAIBAJ&pg=5698%2C1808942 |work=Lewiston Morning Tribune |location=(Idaho) |agency=(obituary) |title=Mustie and Marian Braun, former Lewiston residents |date=February 20, 1981 |page=5C}}</ref> From [[North Dakota]], Mustie was a neighbor and relative of the bandleader [[Lawrence Welk]], and was a keyboard player during the last days of legalized gambling in Idaho at [[Weiser, Idaho|Weiser]] in the early 1950s.

They turned Lucy's Retired Surfers Bar, a small bar and restaurant, into a noted music venue with their Monday night residency from November 1996 to May 1998. During this period, other music venues in Austin invited them to play, including the Continental Club, the Saxon Pub, [[Stubb's Bar-B-Q|Stubb's Barbecue]], and Antone's Home of the Blues.\n\nReckless Kelly's first album, ''[[Millican (album)|Millican]]'', appeared in fall 1997 and was officially released in 1998. ''[[Acoustic: Live at Stubb's]]'' and ''[[The Day (Reckless Kelly album)|The Day]]'' followed two years later, after which David Abeyta replaced Pollock on lead guitar. ''[[Under the Table and Above the Sun|Under the Table & Above the Sun]]'' in 2003 began the band's relationship with the high-profile Sugar Hill label and won the hearts of the music press and the honky tonkin' legend [[Joe Ely]], who sang the band's praises in interviews. ''[[Wicked Twisted Road]]'' was released in 2005, and the next year the live album ''[[Reckless Kelly Was Here]]'' captured the band's stage presence. ''[[Bulletproof (Reckless Kelly album)|Bulletproof]]'' was released in summer 2008 on a new label, [[Yep Roc Records]], and includes tracks critical of and reflecting on recent sociopolitical unfoldings, such as the [[Iraq War]] and [[Hurricane Katrina]]. In 2010, Reckless released an album of songs by one of their musical heroes, Pinto Bennett. ''[[Somewhere in Time (Reckless Kelly album)|Somewhere in Time]]'', in the band's own words, highlighted their love of \"straight-up honky tonk\". The band regularly returns to Austin to play before capacity crowds at venues like Nutty Brown Cafe & Amphitheatre.\n\nYounger brothers Micky and Gary Braun front their own band, [[Micky & The Motorcars]]. Both bands play at the annual Braun Brothers Reunion in Challis, Idaho, in August.\n\n==Discography==\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:18em;\"| Title\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:20em;\"| Album details\n! colspan=\"4\"| Peak chart positions\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n! width=\"40\"| [[Top Country Albums|US Country]]\n! width=\"40\"| [[Billboard 200|US]]\n! width=\"40\"| [[Top Heatseekers|US Heat]]\n! width=\"40\"| [[Independent Albums|US Indie]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[Millican (album)|Millican]]''\n|\n* Release date: July 7, 1998\n* Label: [[Cold Spring (label)|Cold Spring]]\n| —\n| —\n| —\n| —\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[The Day (Reckless Kelly album)|The Day]]''\n|\n* Release date: October 31, 2000\n* Label: [[Valley Entertainment]]\n| —\n| —\n| —\n| —\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[Under the Table and Above the Sun|Under the Table & Above the Sun]]''\n|\n* Release date: May 13, 2003\n* Label: [[Sugar Hill Records (bluegrass)|Sugar Hill Records]]\n| 67\n| —\n| —\n| —\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[Wicked Twisted Road]]''\n|\n* Release date: February 8, 2005\n* Label: Sugar Hill Records\n| 66\n| —\n| —\n| —\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[Bulletproof (Reckless Kelly album)|Bulletproof]]''\n|\n* Release date: June 24, 2008\n* Label: [[Yep Roc Records]]\n| 22\n| 117\n| 2\n| 14\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[Somewhere in Time (Reckless Kelly album)|Somewhere in Time]]''\n|\n* Release date: February 9, 2010\n* Label: Yep Roc Records\n| 22\n| 146\n| 2\n| 15\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Good Luck & True Love''\n|\n* Release date: September 13, 2011\n* Label: No Big Deal/Red Eye\n| 20\n| 78\n| —\n| 18\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Long Night Moon''\n|\n* Release date: September 3, 2013\n* Label: No Big Deal/Red Eye\n| 22\n| 106\n| —\n| 22\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Sunset Motel''\n|\n* Release date: September 23, 2016\n* Label: No Big Deal/Thirty Tigers\n| 12\n| 191\n|—\n|—\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''American Jackpot / American Girls''\n|\n* Release date: May 22, 2020 (Digital)\n* Release date: July 24, 2020 (CD)\n* Label: No Big Deal/Thirty Tigers\n|—\n|—\n|—\n|—\n|-\n| colspan=\"6\" style=\"font-size:8pt\"| \"—\" denotes releases that did not chart\n|}\n\n===Live albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:18em;\"| Title\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:18em;\"| Album details\n! colspan=\"3\" | Peak chart positions\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n! width=\"40\"| [[Top Country Albums|US Country]]\n! width=\"40\"| [[Top Heatseekers|US Heat]]\n! width=\"40\"| [[Independent Albums|US Indie]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[Acoustic: Live at Stubb's]]''\n|\n* Release date: June 6, 2000\n* Label: Valley Entertainment\n| —\n| —\n| —\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[Reckless Kelly Was Here]]''\n|\n* Release date: August 8, 2006\n* Label: Sugar Hill Records\n| 56\n| 41\n| 38\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" style=\"font-size:8pt\"| \"—\" denotes releases that did not chart\n|}\n\n===Compilations ===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:18em;\"| Title\n! style=\"width:18em;\"| Album details\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[Best of the Sugar Hill Years (Reckless Kelly album)|Best of the Sugar Hill Years]]''\n|\n* Release date: July 10, 2007\n* Label: Sugar Hill Records\n|}\n\n===Music videos===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!
