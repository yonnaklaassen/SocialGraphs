Later, Isabel and Tom moved in with her new boyfriend Terrence Messer at the corner of Clarence and Erin Streets. While they did not marry, the family would take on his surname. Terrence and Isabel did pretend to be married to find a place to live, due to the moral standards of the time.<ref>{{harvnb|Stompin' Tom|1995|p=25}}</ref> The family was quite poor, and Terrence was a neglectful stepfather, who spent most of the family's money on wine.

His songs remind us that Canada matters—that we've built something amazing here, and must not take it for granted.<ref name=\"NatPost\" />\n}}\n\nTypically writing about Canadian lore and history, some of Connors' better-known songs include \"[[Bud the Spud]]\", \"[[Big Joe Mufferaw (song)|Big Joe Mufferaw]]\", \"[[Black Donnellys|The Black Donnellys]]\", \"[[The Martin Hartwell Story]]\", \"[[Reesor Siding Strike of 1963|Reesor Crossing Tragedy]]\", \"[[Sudbury Saturday Night]]\", and \"[[The Hockey Song]]\". This last, often incorrectly called \"The Good Old Hockey Game,\" is frequently played over sound systems at [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) games.\n\nThroughout the years, Connors never lost touch with Gaëtan Lepine, the bartender he befriended in Timmins; in fact, the two wrote many songs together. These songs are featured in ''250 Songs by Stompin' Tom: Including All the Words and Chords''.\n\nIn 1968, he composed and sang a radio jingle for a Sudbury-area tire store, Duhamel & Dewar, in exchange for a set of winter tires:<blockquote>\"When your tires are old and worn\n\nand you think they should be newer,\n\ndrive on down to the Tire Town\n\nand see Duhamel and Dewar.\"<ref>{{cite web |date=September 2016 |title=Stompin' Tom Once Wrote a Radio Jingle for Duhamel & Dewar |url=https://southsidestory.ca/2016/09/stompin-tom-once-wrote-a-radio-jingle-for-duhamel-dewar/ |access-date=March 22, 2018 |work=southsidestory.ca}}</ref></blockquote>During the mid-1970s Connors wrote and recorded ''The Consumer'', an ode to bill-paying that became the theme song for the popular [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] (CBC) consumer affairs program ''[[Marketplace (Canadian TV program)|Marketplace]]''. For the first few seasons, Connors appeared in the program's opening credits, before \"The Consumer\" was replaced as the theme—initially by an instrumental background version and ultimately by a different piece of music.\n\nIn 1974 Connors had a series running on [[CBC Television]] in which he met and exchanged with folks from all across Canada. ''[[Stompin' Tom's Canada]]'' was co-produced with the CBC, and consisted of 26 half-hour episodes.\n\nThe song that Connors wrote in the least time was \"Maritime Waltz\", which was completed in 12 minutes.<ref>{{harvnb|Stompin' Tom|1995|p=490}}</ref>\n\nHis character was rough but genuine. As the ''[[National Post]]'' noted:\n\n{{Blockquote|[T]hat persona wasn't [[shtick]]. Stompin' Tom was one of the great Canadian story-tellers, and a uniquely collegial one as well. The proper venue for a [[Gordon Lightfoot]] performance is a [[concert hall]], where the audience connects silently and contemplatively.

It wasn't until [[Canadian Centennial|Canada's 100th birthday]], [[Canada Day|July 1, 1967]], that the name \"Stompin\" Tom Connors was first used, when Boyd MacDonald, a waiter at the King George Tavern in [[Peterborough, Ontario|Peterborough]], Ontario, introduced Connors on stage.<ref>{{harvnb|Stompin' Tom|1995|p=509}}</ref> Based on an enthused audience reaction to it, Connors had it officially registered in Ontario as Stompin' Tom Ltd. the following week. Various stories have circulated about the origin of the foot stomping, but it's generally accepted that he did this to keep a strong tempo for his guitar playing—especially in the noisy bars and beer joints where he frequently performed. After numerous complaints about damaged stage floors, Connors began to carry a piece of [[plywood]] that he stomped even more vigorously than before. The ''\"stompin{{'\"}}'' board became one of his trademarks. After stomping a hole in the wood, he would pick it up and show it to the audience (accompanied by a joke about the quality of the local lumber) before calling for a new one. It was reported that when asked about his \"stompin' board\", Connors replied, \"it's just a stage I'm going through\". Connors periodically auctioned off his \"stompin' boards\" for charity, with one board selling for $15,000 in July 2011.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.torontosun.com/2011/07/02/stompin-tom-raises-money-for-orillia-charity |title=Stompin' Tom raises money for Orillia charity |newspaper=Toronto Sun |date=February 7, 2011 |access-date=March 7, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Favourite guitar===\nConnors's favourite guitar was a [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]] [[Southern Jumbo]] [[Steel-string acoustic guitar|acoustic]] that he purchased in 1956 while on his way through [[Ohio]] to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], and Mexico. He discovered it in a furniture store, hidden in a case on top of a shelf and, after some haggling, purchased it for $80 (he had $90 with him). The guitar was used to audition in 1964 at the Maple Leaf Hotel in Timmins, as well as for writing ''Bud the Spud'' four years later. Although retired in 1972, it remained in his possession. It has subsequently been refurbished, a birthday gift from his wife Lena. The serial number inside the guitar reads 2222 in red stamped numbers and the actual age of the guitar is still unknown.<ref>{{harvnb|Stompin' Tom|1995|pp=356–379}}</ref>\n\n===Releases===\nConnors released music on seven different labels. His earliest foray into recording was on the CKGB Timmins radio station label. These [[Gramophone record|45 RPM]] [[Single (music)|singles]] were pressed by [[Quality Records]] in Toronto, and distributed (and paid for) primarily by Tom. His first two albums (and two subsequent 45 RPM singles) were released on the Rebel Records bluegrass label, under the name \"Tom Connors\". These two albums were subsequently re-released on Dominion Records under the Stompin' Tom moniker and had to be totally re-recorded due to a dispute with Rebel Records owner John Irvine.\n\nMost of Connors's well-known albums were released on Dominion Records (1969–70), and after 1971 on the [[Boot Records]] label that he co-founded with Jury Krytiuk and Mark Altman. His releases on Dominion (and all subsequent releases) were done under the name \"Stompin' Tom Connors\". Most of the Rebel and Dominion albums would be reissued (and in some cases, re-recorded) under the Boot label, and would represent the bulk of his recorded material. It was released on 33{{Fraction|1|3}} RPM record albums, 45 RPM record singles, [[Stereo 8|8-tracks]], and [[Compact Cassette|cassette tapes]].\n\nAfter his retreat from the music business in the late 1970s, he started the A-C-T (Assisting Canadian Talent) label in 1986, and released two albums: ''Stompin' Tom is Back to Assist Canadian Talent'' and his comeback album, ''Fiddle and Songs'' in 1988. A-C-T also re-released Connors's back catalogue on cassette tapes only.\n\nAll of his subsequent releases (and re-releases) have been through [[Capitol Records]] / [[EMI]]. Most of this work is now available on Compact Disc. In recent years, many of his album releases have included at least one re-recording of one of his earlier songs.\n\n===Promoting Canadian artists===\nConnors founded three record labels, which promoted not just his own work, but that of other Canadian artists:\n* [[Boot Records]], together with its budget label Cynda, which were active in the 1970s and 1980s\n* A-C-T, active from the late 1980s\n\nAmong artists who were featured on these labels were [[Liona Boyd]],<ref name=\"Stevenson\">{{cite news|title=Love for Stompin' Tom Connors went beyond Canada's borders|author=Jane Stevenson|url=http://www.torontosun.com/2013/03/07/love-for-stompin-tom-connors-went-beyond-canadas-borders|newspaper=[[Toronto Sun]]|date=March 7, 2013|access-date=March 10, 2013}}</ref> [[Rita MacNeil]], [[The Canadian Brass]], [[Dixie Flyers]], [[Charlie Panigoniak]], among others. [[Liona Boyd]] recalled in 2013 about the time Connors signed Boyd to Boot for her first record, 1974's ''The Guitar'', and two more:\n\n{{Blockquote|It was Tom's vision obviously.

It's like me deciding, \"Well listen, maybe I don't know much about [[rap]], but hey Canada's doesn't have a rap label, I'll go and do it.\" So he was a bit of a pioneer with classical music.<ref name=\"Stevenson\" />\n}}\n\n===Cultural and historical references===\nIn the book ''[[Shake Hands with the Devil: The Failure of Humanity in Rwanda]]'', Romeo Dallaire, the Canadian general who led the [[UNAMIR]] peacekeeping force in [[Rwanda]] during that country's 1994 genocide reported that he played a recording of Connors's song \"The Blue Berets\" (about United Nations peacekeeping forces) to keep up his troops' morale while their headquarters was under bombardment.\n\n[[The Les Claypool Frog Brigade]] mentions Connors in the song \"Long in the Tooth\" on the album ''[[Purple Onion (album)|Purple Onion]]'', while [[Corb Lund]] references him in the song \"Long Gone to Saskatchewan\" and [[Dean Brody]] references him in the song \"[[Canadian Girls]]\".\n\n[[Tim Hus]] also wrote a song titled \"Man with the Black Hat\" about Connors.\n\n===Songs referencing Canadian historical events===\nThe following is a list of events in the [[history of Canada]] which have been the subject of a song by Connors, who is widely renowned for singing about both well-known and little-known episodes in the country's past.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

I feel that the Junos should be for people who are living in Canada, whose main base of business operations is in Canada, who are working toward the recognition of Canadian talent in this country and who are trying to further the export of such talent from this country to the world with a view to proudly showing off what this country can contribute to the world market.\n\nUntil the academy appears to comply more closely with aspirations of this kind, I will no longer stand for any nominations, nor will I accept any award given.\n\nYours very truly,\nStompin' Tom Connors<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Stompin' Tom discloses reasons for Juno nomination withdrawal|url=http://www.stompintom.com/stompintomtimes/rpm.html|magazine=[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]|date=April 22, 1978|access-date=March 8, 2013}}</ref>\n}}\n\nHe remained in retirement for 12 years, only returning to the studio in 1986 to produce a new album to promote Canadian artists.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Stompin' Tom is back from 10-year exile|url=http://news.haltonhills.halinet.on.ca/2326051/page/1?n=6&q=Stompin%27%20Tom%20Connors&docid=OOI.2326051|work=[[The Georgetown Herald]]|date=December 10, 1986|access-date=March 7, 2013}}</ref> That year, [[Tim Vesely]] and [[Dave Bidini]] of [[Rheostatics]] crashed his 50th birthday party and published an article about it in a Toronto newspaper,<ref name=blamecanada>[http://exclaim.ca/Features/Timeline/rheostatics-blame_canada \"Rheostatics: Blame Canada\"]. ''[[Exclaim!]]'', November 2001.</ref> initiating a resurgence of public and record label interest in his work which resulted in the release in 1988 of ''Fiddle and Song'', his first new album since 1977.\n\n===Guest of honour on ''Late Night''===\nConnors' music is rarely heard outside Canada, with the possible exception of his [[anthem]]ic \"[[The Hockey Song]]\" which has been recorded by many artists and played regularly within the arenas of the National Hockey League. It has been suggested that Connors refused to allow foreign release of his material, although a more likely reason is that the very Canadian-specific subject matter of many of his folk songs has resulted in limited demand in foreign markets. When ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' taped a week's worth of shows in Canada in 2004, Connors was one of the guests of honour, leading the Toronto audience in a rendition of \"The Hockey Song\"; this was one of the few times Connors performed on American television. Another Canadian-taped installment of ''Late Night'' featured a segment in which [[Triumph the Insult Comic Dog]] visited [[Quebec]]; a parody of Connors' \"Canada Day, Up Canada Way\" is heard during the segment.\n\n===Dispute with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation===\nAccording to Connors' promoter, Brian Edwards, the CBC had expressed interest for Connors to do a music special since 1990.<ref name=\"Rocklands\">[http://www.stompintom.com/whatsnew/snubbed_by_cbc.html \"Stompin' Tom Snubbed by CBC TV\"] (press release by Brian Edwards, Rocklands Entertainment Inc., Peterborough Ontario), 2006</ref> Connors shot and edited a live concert presentation at Hamilton Place at a cost of over $200,000 of his own money in September 2005. Edwards said that a copy was presented to the CBC's head of TV variety and that he received a reply the next day telling him that a decision would be reached within a few weeks. After 10 weeks, another email was then sent to the newly appointed programming VP, and a prompt reply came back that said that the broadcaster was moving away from music and variety programming and that the Connors special did not fit with its strategy.\n\nEdwards said that he received another letter from the CBC that reinforced its lack of interest in the concert special but said that Connors would have been a great guest to perform a song on the network's ''[[Hockeyville]]'' series or an excellent subject for a ''[[Life and Times (TV series)|Life and Times]]'' project. In response, Connors said:\n\n{{Blockquote|As far as I'm concerned, if the CBC, our own public network, will not reconsider their refusal to air a Stompin' Tom special, they can take their wonderful offer of letting me sing a song as a guest on some other program and shove it.<ref name=\"Rocklands\" />\n}}\n\nUltimately, the film was released on DVD as ''Stompin' Tom In Concert'' by [[EMI]] in 2006.<ref>https://www.discogs.com/release/13466736-Stompin-Tom-Stompin-Tom-in-Live-Concert</ref> The soundtrack was released posthumously on CD<ref>https://www.discogs.com/release/13817145-Stompin-Tom-Connors-Stompin-Tom-in-Live-Concert-Soundtrack</ref> at the same time as a DVD & Blue Ray re-issue by [[Universal Music Canada]] in 2014.<ref>https://www.discogs.com/master/1976677-Stompin-Tom-Stompin-Tom-in-Live-Concert</ref>\n\n===Autobiography===\n''Stompin' Tom: Before the Fame'' is an autobiography detailing Connors' childhood years in an orphanage, and as a [[farm labourer]].
