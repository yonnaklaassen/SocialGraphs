Some of Stephen's closest friends are from that time in his life and considers Michigan just as much a hometown as Kentucky and Tennessee. After moving from [[Eastern, Kentucky]], to Tennessee, he was raised in Nashville's songwriting and recording community. He watched his father, Steve Cochran, wrestle with the machinery of Music Row as a struggling songwriter and artist. Country greats [[Bobby Bare]] and the late [[Del Reeves]] are just a few of the characters that influenced Cochran's early music home life. Cochran cultivated an interest in music beginning at [[Hunters Lane Comprehensive High School]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. Later, he honed his craft in his college days at [[Western Kentucky University]] with a development deal. He worked his way through school writing songs and playing guitar. While at WKU he also helped found and played lacrosse.{{citation needed|date=July 2024}}\n\nAfter September 2001 Cochran joined the [[United States Marine Corps]] and served his country as a Marine in Iraq and Afghanistan.

While on convoy security Cochran was injured, leaving his back broken and without the use of his legs for some time. He was told he may never walk without pain again and he was sent home to the United States. Once he arrived home the search for a solution began.{{citation needed|date=July 2024}} Finally, after a long struggle, Cochran's ability to walk without pain was restored when doctors at the Nashville VA Medical Center performed an experimental procedure called [[kyphoplasty]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url = http://www.richmond.com/business/article_013e4fec-4932-510d-865f-6ca8bc0983ec.html|title = McGuire Veterans research studies are recognized|last = Smith|first = Tammie|date = April 24, 2010|work = [[Richmond Times-Dispatch]]|access-date = September 26, 2015}}</ref> After an extensive rehabilitation Stephen was able to return to an active lifestyle.
