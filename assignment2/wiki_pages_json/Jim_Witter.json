In 1982, he performed four songs on the \"Music for Safe Water\" compilation by 820 CHAM radio.  As a teenager, while still in high school, Jim honed his musical talents by playing evenings at a piano bar and restaurant called Snuggles, in Hamilton Ont.  In 1990, one of Witter's demos caught the attention of a [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony Music Canada]] executive.<ref name=\"Jim Witter's Biography\"/> Within three years, Witter was signed to [[FRE Records]]. His debut album, ''Jim Witter'', was released in 1993.<ref name=\"Inc.1995\">{{cite magazine|author=Larry LeBlanc|title=Canada: Who's Who|magazine=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sAsEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA80|date=4 February 1995|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|pages=80â€“|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> The first single, \"Everything and More,\" entered the National Country Chart at No.&nbsp;40, at the time a first for a debut Canadian single.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20220623084137/http://www.geocities.com/jimwitteronline/facts.html%3F20075  Jim Witter Online - Facts<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Every single released from the album reached the top 10 on the Canadian country singles chart, including \"Distant Drum,\" \"Stolen Moments,\" \"Sweet Sweet Poison\" and \"Chevy Coupe.\" Witter received a [[Juno Awards of 1994|1994]] [[Juno Award|Juno]] nomination for Best New Solo Artist, an award that covered all genres of music, as well as a nomination for Best Country Male Vocalist.\n\nWitter signed a songwriting deal with [[Curb Records]] in 1999. That resulted in a record deal and the release of his second album, ''All My Life'', in both Canada and the United States. He continued his string of hits in Canada with songs like \"All My Life,\" \"Jumpin' Right In,\" \"Tough As A Pickup Truck,\" \"One Beat at a Time\" and \"One Hundred Years.\" Unfortunately, none of his singles reached ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'s'' [[Hot Country Songs]] chart in the U.S.\n\nWhen it came time to go back into the studio, Witter was encouraged by [[Mike Curb]] to record a [[Christian music|Christian]] record.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20220623185451/http://www.geocities.com/jimwitteronline/bio.html%3F20075  Jim Witter - Biography<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The result was his third album, 2003's ''Forgiveness''.
