called Three Little Country Boys.<ref name=\"hjort\"/>  Although they initially started out playing contemporary [[country music]], the group soon switched to a purely [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]]

Kentucky Colonels==\n{{main|Kentucky Colonels (band)}}\nFollowing the recording sessions for the Country Boys' debut album, the band changed its name to the [[Kentucky Colonels (band)|Kentucky

music.<ref name=\"Kingsbury\"/>  After attending a performance by [[Doc Watson]] at the [[Ash Grove (music club)|Ash Grove]] folk club in Los Angeles, where he also met the guitarist, Clarence began to explore the possibilities of the acoustic guitar's role in bluegrass music.<ref name=\"Kingsbury\"/>  At that time, the guitar was largely regarded as a rhythm instrument in bluegrass, with only a few performers, such as  Watson, exploring its potential for soloing.<ref name=\"Kingsbury\"/>  White soon began to integrate elements of Watson's playing style—including the use of open strings and syncopation—into his own flatpicking guitar technique.<ref name=\"byrdwatcher\"/>  His breathtaking speed and virtuosity on the instrument<ref name=\"timeless2\"/> was largely responsible for making the guitar a lead instrument within bluegrass.<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/best-guitarists-1234814010/clarence-white-3-1234814623/|title=250 Greatest

and made many live appearances throughout California and the United States.<ref name=\"hjort\"/>  Between bookings with the Colonels, White also made a guest appearance on [[Eric Weissberg]] and [[Marshall Brickman]]'s ''New Dimensions in Banjo & Bluegrass'' album, which would be re-released in 1973 as the [[soundtrack album]] to the film ''[[Deliverance]]'' (with Weissberg and Steve

appearances at various clubs, concert halls and festivals.<ref name=\"hjort\"/> The Colonels' second album, ''[[Appalachian Swing!]]'',<ref name=\"timeless2\"/> was a commercial success and saw

album was credited to Tut Taylor, Roland and Clarence White upon release.<ref name=\"byrdwatcher\"/>\n\nAlthough the Colonels were a successful recording act, it was becoming increasingly difficult for them to make a living, due to the waning popularity of the [[American folk music revival]] due to the [[British Invasion]] and homegrown [[folk rock]] acts, such as [[the Byrds]] and [[Bob Dylan]].<ref name=\"byrdwatcher\"/>  As a result, the Colonels switched to [[electric instrument]]ation<ref name=\"byrdwatcher\"/> and hired a [[drummer]].<ref>{{Cite

these changes, the Kentucky Colonels dissolved as a band following a show on October 31, 1965.<ref name=\"timeless2\"/>  Clarence, Roland and Eric Jr. formed a new line-up of the Colonels in 1966, with several other musicians, but this second version of the group was short-lived and by early 1967 they had broken up.<ref name=\"byrdwatcher2\">{{cite web|last=Connors|first=Tim|title=Clarence

work (1966–1968)==\nDuring 1964, White began to look beyond bluegrass music towards [[rock 'n' roll]] as an avenue for artistic expression.<ref name=\"timeless\"/>  Although he was influenced by Country guitarists like [[Doc Watson]], [[Don Reno]] and [[Joe Maphis]], he also idolized the playing of [[jazz guitarist]] [[Django Reinhardt]], rock 'n' roller [[Chuck Berry]], and studio musician [[James Burton]].<ref name=\"byrdwatcher2\"/>  White even anticipated the viability of a folk/rock hybrid when, in the summer of 1964, he was approached by Jim Dickson to record a version of the then-unreleased Bob Dylan song \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" with electric instruments.<ref name=\"timeless\"/>  However, despite White's enthusiasm for the project, he was unable to convince his bandmates in the Kentucky Colonels of the experiment's validity<ref name=\"timeless\"/> and ultimately, the song was instead recorded by Dickson's proteges, the Byrds.<ref>{{cite

name=\"timeless\"/>  Abandoning bluegrass temporarily, he switched from his [[Martin D-28]] acoustic guitar to an electric [[Fender Telecaster]], with the intention of becoming a studio musician like his hero James Burton.<ref name=\"lightning\"/>  Transitioning to electric guitar required White to modify his right hand playing technique, switch from [[open chord]]ing to [[fret]]ting the whole [[Neck (music)|guitar neck]] with his left hand, and practice using the tone and volume controls.<ref name=\"lightning\"/>  However, he soon mastered the intricacies of the instrument and, between 1965 and 1968, he undertook session work for artists including [[Ricky Nelson]], [[the Monkees]], and the [[Vern Gosdin|Gosdin Brothers]].<ref name=\"timeless\"/><ref name=\"byrdwatcher2\"/> \n  \nAs 1965 turned into 1966, White met [[Gene Parsons]] and [[Gib Guilbeau]] at a recording session for the Gosdin Brothers and, shortly after, he began to perform live with the duo in local California clubs, as well as doing regular session work on their records, which were released under the moniker of Cajun Gib and Gene.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/><ref name=\"byrdwatcher2\"/>  1966 also saw White begin playing with a country group called Trio, which featured drummer Bart Haney and former Kentucky Colonel, Roger Bush, on bass.<ref name=\"byrdwatcher2\"/>  In autumn of that year, as a result of his friendship with Gilbeau, Parsons and the Gosdin Brothers, White was asked to provide [[lead guitar]] to ex-Byrd [[Gene Clark]]'s debut solo album, ''[[Gene Clark with the Gosdin Brothers]]''.<ref

\"Time Between\" and \"The Girl with No Name\", which both appeared on the Byrds' ''[[Younger Than Yesterday]]'' album.<ref name=\"hjort3\"/>  The country-oriented nature of the songs was something of

Prior to the advent of the more aggressive flatpicking style pioneered by guitarists like Watson and White, the guitar was strictly a rhythm instrument, save for a few exceptions (such as the occasional guitar track by banjoist [[Don Reno]]). Many of the most influential flatpickers of the 20th century cite White as a primary influence, including [[Dan Crary]], [[Norman Blake (American musician)|Norman Blake]], and [[Tony Rice]].  Rice owned and played White's highly modified 1935 [[C.F. Martin & Company|Martin]] D-28. [[David Grier]] and [[Russ Barenberg]] are two other acoustic guitarists who were heavily influenced by White's guitar work.  White's bluegrass playing with the Kentucky Colonels was also a considerable influence on [[Jerry Garcia]] of the [[Grateful Dead]],<ref name=\"lightning\"/> who traveled with the band during 1964.<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=Livin' in the Past|others=[[Kentucky Colonels]]|year=2003|first=John|last=Delgatto|page=2|type=CD booklet|publisher=Sierra Records|location=Pasadena}}</ref>\n\nOn the electric side of the guitar spectrum, White was similarly influential.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Together with fellow Byrds bandmember [[Gene Parsons]], White invented the [[B-Bender]] device. This device raises the B-string (second string) of the guitar a whole step by the use of pulleys and levers attached to both the upper strap knob and the second string on the guitar. It is activated by pushing down on the neck, and produces a \"[[pedal steel]]\" type sound. [[Arlen Roth]], heavily influenced by this style, did not at the time know that White and Parsons had invented a B-bender, so instead developed his own unique all-finger bending version of this technique. This was heavily documented in his ground-breaking book, \"Nashville Guitar\", all of his recordings, as well as his book \"Masters of the Telecaster\". Subsequently, his [[Telecaster]] sound became as notable as his bluegrass playing.
