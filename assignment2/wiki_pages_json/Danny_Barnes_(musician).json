This band released only a single album, 2001's ''Things I Done Wrong'', which was produced by avant-garde jazz composer and pianist [[Wayne Horvitz]] (a fellow Seattle resident). 2002 saw Barnes working with jazz [[guitar]]ist [[Bill Frisell]]; Frisell was moving towards incorporating more \"American\"—country and bluegrass—influences into his playing, and he wanted Barnes to give him lessons in that direction. Their work together led to Barnes playing on Frisell's next album, ''The Willies''; Barnes also toured with Frisell in support of the album.\n\nSince moving to Washington, Barnes has also recorded several solo albums, which were self-released, and a duet effort. His 2003 album ''Dirt on the Angel'', released on [[Terminus Records]], featured Frisell, [[Chuck Leavell]], [[Darol Anger]], and [[Dirk Powell]]. In 2004 Barnes participated in Wayne Horvitz's Mylab band and released his second CD for Terminus Records, ''Get Myself Together''.\n\nOn 9/21/2007, Danny joined Robert Earl Keen during an opening for the Dave Matthews Band in Houston. Danny joined DMB during their song \"Bartender\". He also joined DMB during their show at Smirnoff Music Centre in Dallas, and at their two shows at the Hollywood Bowl in California to conclude DMB's summer 2007 tour. He joined the band onstage once again for their three-night stand at [[The Gorge Amphitheatre|The Gorge]] in 2009. He also joined them on stage on June 18, 2010 in Noblesville, Indiana.\n\nIn 2015, Barnes played and toured with the Jeff Austin Band. In September 2015, he was awarded the Steve Martin Prize for Excellence in Banjo and Bluegrass.<ref name= Itzkoff /> In an interview with ''[[Texas Monthly]]'', asked what he intended to do with the prize money, Barnes replied, \"I'm going to invest it in my art.\"<ref name= Hall />\n\nIn 2017 and 2018, Barnes toured with mandolinist Joe K.
