He also received a [[Grammy Hall of Fame]] Award.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nCarl Lee Perkins was born on April 9, 1932, in [[Tiptonville, Tennessee]], the son of poor [[sharecropper]]s Louise and Buck Perkins (misspelled on his birth certificate as \"Perkings\").<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">[https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/carlperkins/biography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100226181247/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/carlperkins/biography|date=February 26, 2010}}</ref> Beginning at the age of six, he worked long hours in the cotton fields with his family, whether school was in session or not. Siblings included brothers Jay and Clayton.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, pp. 8–9.]]</ref> The boys grew up hearing [[Southern gospel]] music sung by white friends in church and by black field workers and sharecroppers in the cotton fields.<ref name=pc8>{{Pop Chronicles|8|3}}</ref> On Saturday nights Perkins would listen to the ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'', broadcast from [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] on his father's radio.\n\n[[Roy Acuff]]'s broadcasts from the Opry inspired Perkins to ask his parents for a guitar.<ref>[[#legends|Naylor.]]</ref> Since they could not afford to buy one, his father made one from a [[cigar box guitar|cigar box]] and a broomstick. Eventually, a neighbor sold his father a worn-out [[Gene Autry]] guitar. Perkins could not afford new strings, and when they broke, he had to retie them. The knots cut his fingers when he would slide to another note, so he began bending the notes, stumbling onto a type of [[blue note]].<ref name=\"naylor118\" /><ref name=\":0\">[[#gocatgo|Perkins, pp. 13–14.]]</ref>\n\nPerkins taught himself parts of Acuff's \"[[The Great Speckled Bird (song)|Great Speckled Bird]]\" and \"[[The Wabash Cannonball]]\", having heard them played on the ''Opry''. He also has cited [[Bill Monroe]]'s fast playing and vocals as an early influence.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, pp. 11–12.]]</ref> Perkins also learned from John Westbrook, an African-American field worker in his sixties who played blues and gospel music on an old acoustic guitar. Westbrook advised Perkins to \"Get down close to it. You can feel it travel down the strangs, come through your head and down to your soul where you live. You can feel it. Let it vib-a-rate.\"<ref name=\"naylor118\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn January 1947, the Perkins family moved from [[Lake County, Tennessee]], to [[Madison County, Tennessee|Madison County]], 70 miles from [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], the largest city in West Tennessee and a center of a great variety of music played by both black and white artists.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, pp. 30, 55.]]</ref> At age fourteen Perkins wrote a country song called \"Let Me Take You to the Movie, Magg\". [[Sam Phillips]] was later persuaded by the quality of that song to sign Perkins to his [[Sun Records]] label.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, pp. 30, 68.]]</ref>\n\n===Beginnings as a performer===\nPerkins and his brother Jay had their first paying job (in tips) as entertainers during late 1946 at the Cotton Boll tavern on Highway 45, twelve miles south of Jackson, Tennessee, starting on Wednesday nights. Perkins was 14 years old. One of the songs they played was an up-tempo country blues shuffle version of [[Bill Monroe]]'s \"[[Blue Moon of Kentucky]]\". Free drinks were one of the perks of playing in a tavern, and Perkins drank four beers that first night. Within a month Carl and Jay began playing Friday and Saturday nights at the Sand Ditch tavern, near the western boundary of Jackson. Both places were the scene of occasional fights, and both of the Perkins brothers gained a reputation as fighters.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, pp. 36–41.]]</ref>\n\nDuring the next couple of years, as they became better known, the Perkins brothers began playing other taverns around Bemis and Jackson, including El Rancho, the Roadside Inn, and the Hilltop. Carl persuaded his brother Clayton to join them and play the [[upright bass]], to complete the sound of the band.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, p. 48.]]</ref>\n\nPerkins began performing regularly on [[WTJF (AM)|WTJS]] in Jackson during the late 1940s as a sometime member of the [[Tennessee Ramblers (Tennessee band)|Tennessee Ramblers]]. He appeared on the radio program ''Hayloft Frolic'', on which he performed two songs. Sometimes one was \"Talking Blues\", as done by Robert Lunn on the ''Grand Ole Opry''. Perkins and his brothers began appearing on ''The Early Morning Farm and Home Hour''. Positive listener response resulted in a 15-minute segment sponsored by Mother's Best Flour. By the end of the 1940s, the Perkins Brothers were the best-known band in the Jackson area.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, pp. 48–49.]]</ref> Perkins had day jobs during most of these early years, including picking cotton, working at various factories and plants, and as a pan greaser for the Colonial Baking Company.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, pp. 32, 70–71.]]</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://rockabillytennessee.com/legend_carl_perkins.htm |title=The Legend Carl Perkins |publisher=Rockabillytennessee.com |date=1998-01-19 |access-date=2011-11-25 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111117221958/http://www.rockabillytennessee.com/legend_carl_perkins.htm |archive-date=November 17, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> His brothers had similar pick-up jobs.\n\nIn January 1953, Perkins married Valda Crider, whom he had known for a number of years. When his job at the bakery was reduced to part-time, Valda, who had her own job, encouraged Perkins to begin working the taverns full-time. He began playing six nights a week. Later the same year he added [[W. S. Holland|W.S. \"Fluke\" Holland]] to the band as a drummer. Holland had no previous experience as a musician but had a good sense of rhythm.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, pp. 70–71.]]</ref>\n\n[[Malcolm Yelvington]], who remembered the Perkins Brothers when they played in [[Covington, Tennessee]], in 1953, noted that Carl had an unusual blues-like style all his own.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, p. 77.]]</ref> By 1955 Perkins had made tapes of his material with a borrowed tape recorder, and he sent them to companies such as Columbia and RCA. But he used addresses such as \"Columbia Records, New York City\" and seemed dismayed at the lack of response. \"I had sent tapes to RCA and [[Columbia Records|Columbia]] and had never heard a thing from 'em.\"<ref name=\"Top Beats Bottom\"/>\n\nIn July 1954, Perkins and his wife heard a new release of \"[[Blue Moon of Kentucky]]\" by [[Elvis Presley]], [[Scotty Moore]] and [[Bill Black]] on the radio.<ref>[http://rcs-discography.com/rcs/pics/d03/3318.htm]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}</ref> As the song faded out, Perkins said, \"There's a man in Memphis who understands what we're doing.

In the same year, Perkins was cast in a Filipino movie produced by People's Pictures, ''Hawaiian Boy'', in which he sang \"Blue Suede Shoes\".{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nHe performed often at the [[Golden Nugget Las Vegas|Golden Nugget Casino]] in Las Vegas in 1962 and 1963.{{citation needed|date=November 2022}} During this time he toured nine Midwestern states and made a tour in Germany.{{citation needed|date=November 2022}} In 1962 [[Patsy Cline]] recorded \"[[So Wrong]]\" written by Carl, [[Mel Tillis]] and [[Danny Dill]] and had a #14 hit on the Country charts.\n\nIn May 1964, Perkins toured [[UK|Britain]] with [[Chuck Berry]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chuckberry.de/tour1964.htm#Chuck%20Berry |title=Tour Information 1964 |publisher=Chuckberry.de |access-date=2011-11-25}}</ref> Perkins had been reluctant to undertake the tour, convinced that as forgotten as he had become in America, he would be even more obscure in the U.K., and did not want to be humiliated by drawing meager audiences. Berry assured him that they had remained much more popular in Britain since the 1950s than they had in the United States, and that there would be large crowds of fans at every show. The popular young rock group [[The Animals]] backed the two performers. On the last night of the tour, Perkins attended a party where he sat on the floor sharing stories, playing guitar, and singing songs while surrounded by the [[The Beatles|Beatles]]. Ringo Starr asked if he could record \"Honey Don't\". Perkins answered, \"Man, go ahead, have at it.\"<ref>[[#legends|Naylor, p. 142.]]</ref> The Beatles later recorded covers of \"[[Matchbox (song)|Matchbox]]\", \"[[Honey Don't]]\" and \"[[Everybody's Trying to Be My Baby]]\" (recorded by Perkins, adapted from a song originally recorded by [[Rex Griffin]] in 1936, with new music by Perkins; a song with the same title was recorded by Roy Newman in 1938). Ringo sang the lead on the first two, [[George Harrison]] received a rare lead on the third. The Beatles also recorded two versions of \"Glad All Over\" in 1963.<ref>{{cite web|author=The Beatles \"Glad All Over\" |url=http://www.oldielyrics.com/lyrics/the_beatles/glad_all_over.html |title=The Beatles Lyrics - Glad All Over |publisher=Oldielyrics.com |access-date=2011-11-25}}</ref> Another tour to Germany followed in the autumn.\n\nHe released \"Big Bad Blues\" backed with \"Lonely Heart\" as a single on Brunswick Records with [[the Nashville Teens]] in June 1964.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.45cat.com/record/05909 |title=Carl Perkins - Big Bad Blues / Lonely Heart - Brunswick - UK - 05909 |publisher=45cat |access-date=2015-08-17}}</ref>\n\nIn 1966, Perkins signed with Dollie Records and released as his first single \"Country Boy's Dream\", which reached #22 in the country charts. That same year [[Bob Luman]] had a Top 40 Country hit with Carl's song \"Poor Boy Blues\".\n\nWhile on tour with the Johnny Cash troupe in 1968, Perkins went on a four-day drinking binge that ended in him hallucinating floridly and passing out. When he regained consciousness, he went out to the beach with his last bottle of alcohol. In his autobiography, he described falling to his knees and declaring, \"Lord,&nbsp;... I'm gonna throw this bottle. I'm gonna show You that I believe in you,\" before hurling the bottle into the sea and vowing to remain sober. Perkins and Cash, who had his own substance-abuse issues, supported each other in their bid to remain sober.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, pp. 309–310.]]</ref>\n\nIn 1968, Cash recorded the Perkins-written \"[[Daddy Sang Bass]]\" (which incorporates parts of the American standard \"[[Can the Circle Be Unbroken (Bye and Bye)|Will the Circle Be Unbroken]]\"), and scored No. 1 on the country music charts for six weeks. \"Daddy Sang Bass\" was a [[Country Music Association]] nominee for Song of the Year. Perkins also played lead guitar on Cash's single \"[[A Boy Named Sue]]\", recorded live at [[San Quentin]] prison, which went to No. 1 for five weeks on the country chart and No. 2 on the pop chart (the performance was also filmed by [[Granada Television]] for broadcast).\n\nPerkins spent a decade in Cash's touring revue, often as an opening act for Cash (as at the Folsom and San Quentin prison concerts, at which he was recorded singing \"Blue Suede Shoes\" and \"Matchbox\" before Cash took the stage; these performances were not released until the 2000s). He also appeared on the television series ''[[The Johnny Cash Show (TV series)|The Johnny Cash Show]]''. On the television program ''[[Kraft Music Hall]]'' on April 16, 1969, hosted by Cash, Perkins performed his song \"[[Restless (Carl Perkins song)|Restless]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockabillyeurope.com/lyrics3/r0051.htm |title=Restless - Carl Perkins |publisher=Rockabillyeurope.com |access-date=2011-11-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929222820/http://www.rockabillyeurope.com/lyrics3/r0051.htm |archive-date=September 29, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tv.com/kraft-music-hall/johnny-cash...on-the-road/episode/170681/summary.html |title=Kraft Music Hall: Johnny Cash&nbsp;...

Perkins and NRBQ recorded ''Boppin' the Blues'', which featured the group backing him on songs including his staples \"Turn Around\" and \"Boppin' the Blues\", as well as songs recorded separately by Perkins and NRBQ.<ref>''Boppin' the Blues''. Columbia CS9981 (1969).</ref> Perkins appeared with Cash on TV on the popular country series ''[[Hee Haw]]'', on February 16, 1974.\n\n[[Tommy Cash]] (brother of Johnny Cash) had a Top Ten country gospel hit in 1970, with a recording of the song \"Rise and Shine\", written by Perkins. It reached number 9 on the ''Billboard'' country chart and number 8 on the Canadian country chart. [[Arlene Harden]] had a Top 40 country hit in 1971 with the Perkins composition \"True Love Is Greater Than Friendship\", from the film ''[[Little Fauss and Big Halsy]]'' (1971). [[Al Martino]]'s cover of the song that same year reached number 22 on the ''Billboard'' country chart and number 33 on the ''Billboard'' Adult Contemporary chart.\n\nAfter a long legal struggle with Sam Phillips over [[royalties]], Perkins gained ownership of his songs in the 1970s and, in 2003, his widow and then owner of the catalog entered into an administration contract with Paul McCartney's [[MPL Communications]].<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web |author=Mike Kovacich |url=http://www.macca-central.com/macca-news/morenews.php?id=1157 |title=MACCA-News: McCartney to Administer Perkins's Music |publisher=Macca-central.com |date=April 17, 2003 |access-date=2011-11-25 |archive-date=February 13, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213055837/http://www.macca-central.com/macca-news/morenews.php?id=1157 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Later years===\nThe rockabilly revival of the 1980s helped bring Perkins back into the limelight. In 1981 Perkins recorded the song \"Get It\" with [[Paul McCartney]], providing vocals and playing guitar with the former Beatle; according to one source, he fully co-wrote the song with McCartney.<ref>[[#legends|Naylor, p. 145.]]</ref> This recording was included on the chart-topping album ''[[Tug of War (Paul McCartney album)|Tug of War]]'', released in 1982.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jpgr.co.uk/pctc259.html |title=Tug Of War |publisher=Jpgr.co.uk |access-date=2011-11-25}}</ref>  During 1985, Perkins re-recorded \"Blue Suede Shoes\" with [[Lee Rocker]] and [[Slim Jim Phantom]] of the [[Stray Cats]], as part of the soundtrack for the film ''[[Porky's Revenge]]''.\n\nIn October 1985, Perkins was joined on stage in [[London]] for a television special, ''[[Blue Suede Shoes: A Rockabilly Session]]'', by [[George Harrison]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Dave Edmunds]], Lee Rocker, [[Rosanne Cash]] and [[Ringo Starr]]. The show was taped live at the [[Limehouse Studios]]. It was broadcast on [[Channel 4]] on January 1, 1986. Perkins performed 16 songs, with two encores, in an extraordinary performance. He and his friends ended the session by singing \"Blue Suede Shoes\", his most famous song, 30 years after its writing, which brought Perkins to tears. The concert special was a highlight of his later career. It has been praised by fans for the spirited performances delivered by Perkins and his guests. The concert was released for DVD by Snapper Music in 2006.<ref>DVD ''Carl Perkins & Friends''. Released by Graham Nolder/Snapper Music. 2006. Cat:SDVD514</ref>\n\nPerkins was inducted into the [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 1985. Wider recognition of his contribution to music came with his induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1987. \"Blue Suede Shoes\" was chosen as one of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's [[The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll|“500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll”]]. The song also received a [[Grammy Hall of Fame Award]]. Perkins was inducted into the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]] in recognition of his pioneering contribution to the genre.\n\nPerkins's only notable film performance as an actor was in [[John Landis]]'s 1985 film ''[[Into the Night (1985 film)|Into the Night]]''. The cameo-laden film includes a scene in which characters played by Perkins and [[David Bowie]] die by each other's hand.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089346/fullcredits#cast|title=Into the Night (1985): Full Cast & Crew|publisher=IMDb.com|access-date=2015-08-17}}</ref>\n\nPerkins returned to the Sun Studio in Memphis in 1986, joining Cash, Jerry Lee Lewis, and [[Roy Orbison]] on the album ''[[Class of '55]]''. The record was a tribute to their early years at Sun and, specifically, the Million Dollar Quartet [[jam session]] involving Perkins, Presley, Cash, and Lewis in 1956.\n\nIn 1989, Perkins co-wrote and played guitar on [[the Judds]]' number 1 country hit, \"Let Me Tell You About Love\". Also in that year, he signed a record deal with Platinum Records for the album ''Friends, Family, and Legends'', featuring performances by [[Chet Atkins]], [[Travis Tritt]], [[Steve Wariner]], [[Joan Jett]] and [[Charlie Daniels]], along with [[Paul Shaffer]] and Will Lee. The song \"Wild Texas Wind\" became the title track to a made-for-TV [[Wild Texas Wind|movie]] featuring [[Dolly Parton]] and [[Gary Busey]]. In 1996 [[Willie Nelson]], who also appeared in that movie, would join Carl in a duett version of the song. During the production of this album, Perkins was diagnosed with [[Esophageal cancer|throat cancer]]. \nDolly Parton had a Top 20 Country hit in 1991 with the Perkins co-written [[Silver and Gold (Dolly Parton song)|\"Silver and Gold\"]].\n\n[[Mark O'Connor]] recorded a version of the Perkins classic [[Restless (Carl Perkins song)|\"Restless\"]] in 1991 and had a #25 Country hit with it in the US (#19 in Canada).\n\nHe again returned to Sun Studio to record with Scotty Moore, Presley's first guitar player, for the album ''706 ReUNION'', released by Belle Meade Records, which also featured [[D. J. Fontana]], Marcus Van Storey and [[the Jordanaires]]. In 1993, Perkins performed with the [[Kentucky Headhunters]] in a music video remake of his song \"Dixie Fried\", filmed in [[Glasgow, Kentucky]]. In 1994, he teamed up with [[Duane Eddy]] and [[the Mavericks]] to contribute \"Matchbox\" to the [[AIDS]] benefit album ''[[Red Hot + Country]]'', produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]].\n\nHis last album, ''[[Go Cat Go!]]'', released by the independent label Dinosaur Records in 1996, features Perkins singing duets with [[Bono]], Johnny Cash, [[John Fogerty]], George Harrison, Paul McCartney, [[Willie Nelson]], [[Tom Petty]], [[Paul Simon]], and [[Ringo Starr]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theband.hiof.no/albums/go_cat_go.html |title=Carl Perkins/Various Artists: Go Cat Go! |publisher=Theband.hiof.no |access-date=2011-11-25}}</ref><ref>[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=Carl Perkins|chart=all}} ]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}</ref>\n\nHis last major concert performance was the [[Music for Montserrat]] all-star charity concert at London's [[Royal Albert Hall]] on September 15, 1997, four months before his death.\n\n==Personal life==\nA strong advocate for the prevention of child abuse, Perkins worked with the Jackson Exchange Club to establish the first center for the prevention of child abuse in Tennessee and the fourth in the nation. Proceeds from a concert planned by Perkins were combined with a grant from the [[National Exchange Club]] to establish the Prevention of Child Abuse in October 1981. For years its annual Circle of Hope Telethon generated one quarter of the center's annual operating budget.<ref>Tennessee Historical Commission</ref>\n\nPerkins had one daughter, Debbie, and three sons, Stan, Greg, and Steve.  Stan, Perkins' firstborn son, is also a recording artist. In 2010, he joined forces with [[Jerry Naylor]] to record a duet tribute, \"To Carl: Let It Vibrate\".
