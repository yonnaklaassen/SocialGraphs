During his thirty-five-year career, first with his band [[Mink DeVille]] (1974–1986) and later on his own, DeVille created original songs rooted in traditional American musical styles. He worked with collaborators from across the spectrum of contemporary music, including [[Jack Nitzsche]], [[Doc Pomus]], [[Dr. John]], [[Mark Knopfler]], [[Allen Toussaint]], and [[Eddie Bo]]. [[Music of Latin America|Latin rhythms]], [[blues]] riffs, [[doo-wop]], [[Cajun music]], strains of French [[cabaret]], and echoes of early-1960s uptown [[Soul music|soul]] can be heard in DeVille's work.\n\nMink DeVille was a [[house band]] at [[CBGB]], the historic New York City nightclub where [[punk rock]] was born in the mid-1970s. DeVille helped redefine the [[Brill Building#\"Brill Building Sound\"|Brill Building sound]]. In 1987 his song \"Storybook Love\" was nominated for an [[Academy Award]]. After his move to [[New Orleans]] in 1988, he helped spark the [[roots revival]] of classic [[New Orleans rhythm and blues|New Orleans R&B]]. His soulful lyrics and explorations in Latin rhythms and sounds helped define a new musical style sometimes called \"Spanish-Americana\".<ref>For example, the term \"Spanish-Americana appears on DeVille's [http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendID=80140845 MySpace Music page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071117020027/http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile |date=November 17, 2007 }} (Retrieved Jan 24, 2008)</ref>\n\nDeVille died of [[pancreatic cancer]] on August 6, 2009, at the age of 58.<ref>Fusilli, Jim (August 7, 2009) [https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2009/08/07/willy-deville-dies-at-58/ \"Willy DeVille Dies at 58.\"] ''[[Wall Street Journal]].''

(Retrieved October 4, 2010.)</ref>\n\nWriting in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' about the posthumous release of DeVille's ''Come a Little Bit Closer: The Best of Willy DeVille Live'' (2011), Marc Meyers declared, \"There was creative heat and pain in Mr. DeVille's eerie, edgy look and sound. While his punk-roadhouse fusion sailed over the heads of many at home, his approach inspired many British pop invaders of the 1980s, including [[Tears for Fears]], [[Human League]] and [[Culture Club]] ... He was a punk eclectic with a heart of golden oldies and [[Joe Cocker]]'s pipes. A seedy sophisticate, Mr. DeVille was decades ahead of his time.\"<ref>Meyers, Marc (May 20, 2011) [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703421204576331281185742912 Brilliant, Shook-Up Guy].
