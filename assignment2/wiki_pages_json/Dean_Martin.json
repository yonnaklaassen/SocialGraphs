They performed in nightclubs and later had numerous appearances on radio and television and in films.\n\nFollowing an acrimonious ending of the partnership in 1956, Martin pursued a solo career as a performer and actor. He established himself as a singer, recording numerous contemporary songs as well as standards from the [[Great American Songbook]]. Martin became one of the most popular acts in Las Vegas and was known for his friendship with fellow artists [[Frank Sinatra]] and [[Sammy Davis Jr.]], who together with several others formed the [[Rat Pack]].\n\nStarting in 1965, Martin was the host of the television variety program ''[[The Dean Martin Show]]'', which centered on Martin's singing and comedic talents and was characterized by his relaxed, easy-going demeanor. From 1974 to 1984, Martin was [[roastmaster]] on the popular ''[[Dean Martin Celebrity Roast]]'', which drew celebrities, comedians and politicians. Throughout his career, Martin performed in concert stages, nightclubs, audio recordings and appeared in 85 film and television productions and sold 12 million records in the US alone, over 50 million worldwide.\n\nMartin's best known songs include \"[[Ain't That a Kick in the Head?]]\", \"[[Memories Are Made of This]]\", \"[[That's Amore]]\", \"[[Everybody Loves Somebody]]\", \"[[You're Nobody till Somebody Loves You]]\", \"[[¿Quién será?|Sway]]\", and \"[[Nel blu, dipinto di blu (song)#Volare (Dean Martin)|Volare]]\".\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Dean Martin Mural in Steubenville.jpg|left|thumb|Mural of Dean Martin in Steubenville, Ohio]]\n\nMartin was born Dino Paul Crocetti on June 7, 1917, in [[Steubenville, Ohio]], to Italian father Gaetano Alfonso Crocetti (1894–1967) and Italian-American mother Angela Crocetti (''née'' Barra; 1897–1966). Gaetano, who was a barber, was originally from [[Montesilvano|Montesilvano, Pescara]], and Angela was born December 18, 1897, in [[Fernwood, Ohio]]. Angela's father, Domenico Barra, emigrated from [[Monasterolo del Castello]], Bergamo. Martin's first language was Italian and he spoke no English until starting school at the age of five. Martin attended Grant Elementary School in Steubenville, where he was bullied for his [[broken English]]. As a teenager, Martin played the drums as a hobby. He dropped out of [[Steubenville High School]] in the tenth grade because, according to Martin, he thought he was smarter than his teachers.<ref name=SONGSTERS>{{cite book| last=Parish| first=James Robert| title=Hollywood Songsters: Singers Who ACT and Actors Who Sing: A Biographical Dictionary| volume=2| year=2003| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p3HWDtBhLykC&dq=dean+martin&pg=PA386-IA1| publisher=Routledge| location=New York| isbn=978-0-415-94333-8| page=533}}</ref> Martin [[Rum-running|bootlegged liquor]], worked in a steel mill, served as a [[croupier]] at a [[speakeasy]] and a [[blackjack]] dealer, and was a welterweight boxer.<ref name=\"bio\">{{cite web |url=https://www.deanmartin.com/bio/ |website=The Official Dean Martin site |title=Dean Martin Bio |access-date=June 21, 2019 |archive-date=June 22, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190622043336/https://www.deanmartin.com/bio/ |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAt 15, Martin billed himself as \"Kid Crochet\". His prizefighting earned him a broken nose (later straightened), a scarred lip, many broken knuckles (a result of not being able to afford tape used to wrap boxers' hands), and a bruised body. Of his 12 bouts, Martin said that he \"won all but 11.\"{{sfn|Tosches|1992|p=57}} For a time, he shared a New York City apartment with [[Sonny King (singer)|Sonny King]], who was also starting in show business and had little money.

Their debut together occurred at [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]]'s [[500 Club]] on July 24, 1946, and they were not well received. The owner, [[Skinny D'Amato]], warned them that if they did not come up with a better act for their second show that night, they would be fired. Huddling in the alley behind the club, Lewis and Martin agreed to \"go for broke\", they divided their act between songs, skits, and ad-libbed material.<ref>Ambalal, Monica.

This success led to a series of well-paying engagements on the Eastern seaboard, culminating in a run at New York's [[Copacabana (nightclub)|Copacabana]]. The act consisted of Lewis interrupting and heckling Martin while he was trying to sing, with the two ultimately chasing each other around the stage. The secret, both said, is that they ignored the audience and played to each other. The team made its television debut on the first broadcast of CBS-TV network's ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' (then called ''The Toast Of The Town'') on June 20, 1948, with composers [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] also appearing. Hoping to improve their act, the two hired young comedy writers [[Norman Lear]] and Ed Simmons to write their bits.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/features/norman-lear-recalls-early-days-as-tv-comedy-writer-1201629371/ |title=Norman Lear Looks Back on Early Days as TV Comedy Writer |first=Tim |last=Gray |date=October 30, 2015 |newspaper=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}</ref> With the assistance of both Lear and Simmons, the two would take their act beyond nightclubs.<ref>{{cite magazine| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZgoEAAAAMBAJ&q=%2252g+to+simmons%22&pg=PA12-IA1| page=12| title=52G to Simmons, Lear to Do Five Martin-Lewis Shows| date=October 31, 1953| magazine=Billboard| via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nA [[The Martin and Lewis Show (radio program)|radio series]] began in 1949, the year Martin and Lewis signed with [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] producer [[Hal B.

Their agent, Abby Greshler, negotiated one of Hollywood's best deals: although they received only $75,000 between them for their films with Wallis, Martin and Lewis were free to do one outside film a year, which they would co-produce through their own York Productions.{{sfn|Tosches|1992|p=208}}\n\nThey also controlled their club, record, radio, and television appearances, and through these they earned millions of dollars. In ''Dean & Me'', Lewis calls Martin one of the great comic geniuses of all time. They were friends, as well, with Lewis acting as best man when Martin remarried in 1949. But harsh comments from critics, as well as frustration with the similarity of Martin and Lewis movies, which producer Hal Wallis refused to change, led to Martin's dissatisfaction.{{sfn|Lewis|Kaplan|2005|p=223}} He put less enthusiasm into the work, leading to escalating arguments with Lewis.

In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Martin and Sinatra, along with friends [[Joey Bishop]], [[Peter Lawford]], and [[Sammy Davis Jr.]], formed the Rat Pack, so-called after an earlier group of social friends, the [[Holmby Hills, Los Angeles|Holmby Hills]] Rat Pack centered on [[Humphrey Bogart]] and [[Lauren Bacall]], of which Sinatra had been a member (The Martin-Sinatra-Davis-Lawford-Bishop group referred to themselves as \"The Summit\" or \"The Clan\" and never as \"The Rat Pack\", although this has remained their identity in popular imagination). The men made films together, formed part of the Hollywood social scene, and were politically influential (through Lawford's marriage to Patricia Kennedy, sister of President [[John F.

For example, the marquee at the [[Sands Hotel and Casino|Sands Hotel]] might read \"DEAN MARTIN—MAYBE FRANK—MAYBE SAMMY\". Their appearances were valuable because the city would flood with wealthy gamblers. Their act (always in tuxedo) consisted of each singing individual numbers, duets and trios, along with seemingly improvised slapstick and chatter. In the socially charged 1960s, their jokes revolved around adult themes, such as Sinatra's womanizing and Martin's drinking, as well as Davis's race and religion. Sinatra and Martin supported the civil rights movement and refused to perform in clubs that would not allow black American or Jewish performers.<ref name=\"FRANKSINATRA-NANCY\">{{cite book| last=Sinatra| first=Nancy| title=Frank Sinatra: An American Legend| year=1998| url=https://archive.org/details/franksinatraamer00sina/page/156/mode/2up| publisher=General Publishing Group| location=Santa Monica| isbn=978-1-8816-4968-7| page=156| url-access=registration}}</ref> Posthumously, the Rat Pack has experienced a popular revival, inspiring the [[George Clooney]]/[[Brad Pitt]] ''[[Ocean's Trilogy]]''.<ref>{{cite news |last=Horton |first=Oliver |date=January 26, 2002 |title=A Youthful Revival of Rat Pack Style |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/26/news/a-youthful-revival-of-rat-pack-style.html |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=December 26, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===''The Dean Martin Show''===\n{{Main|The Dean Martin Show}}\n[[File:Dean Martin Florence Henderson 1958.JPG|thumb|right|Martin and [[Florence Henderson]] in ''[[The Dean Martin Show]]'' (1968)]]\nIn 1965, Martin launched his weekly [[NBC]] comedy-variety series, ''The Dean Martin Show'', which ran for 264 episodes until 1974. He won a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Television Series Musical or Comedy]] in 1966 and was nominated again the following three years.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.goldenglobes.com/tv-show/dean-martin-show |title=Dean Martin Show, The |website=Golden Globe Awards |access-date=December 26, 2016}}</ref> The show exploited his image as a carefree boozer. Martin capitalized on his laid-back persona of the half-drunk [[crooner]], inappropriately hitting on women, and making snappy if slurred remarks about fellow celebrities during his [[Roast (comedy)|roasts]]. During an interview on the British TV documentary ''Wine, Women and Song'', aired in 1983, Martin stated, perhaps tongue-in-cheek, that he had someone record them on cassette tape so he could listen to them. Martin's TV show was a success. The show's loose format featured quick-witted improvisation from Martin and his weekly guests. This prompted a battle between Martin and NBC censors, who insisted on more scrutiny of the content. He later had trouble with NBC for his off-the-cuff use of obscene Italian phrases, which brought complaints from viewers who spoke the language. The show was often in the Top Ten. Martin, appreciative of the show's producer, his friend [[Greg Garrison (television producer)|Greg Garrison]], made a handshake deal giving Garrison, a pioneer TV producer in the 1950s, 50% of the show. However, the validity of that ownership is the subject of a lawsuit brought by [[NBCUniversal]].\n\nDespite Martin's reputation as a drinker—perpetuated via his vanity license plate \"DRUNKY\"—his alcohol use was quite disciplined.{{sfn|Tosches|1992|p=198}} Martin was the first to call it a night and, when not on tour or on a film location, liked to go home to see his family.<ref>{{cite news |last=King |first=Susan |date=December 25, 2015 |title=Newsletter: Classic Hollywood: What was Dean Martin really drinking? |url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/classichollywood/la-et-mn-classic-hollywood-newsletter-dean-martin-20151225-html-htmlstory.html |work=Los Angeles Times |access-date=December 26, 2016}}</ref> Martin borrowed the lovable-drunk [[shtick]] from [[Joe E. Lewis]], but his convincing portrayals of heavy boozers in ''[[Some Came Running (film)|Some Came Running]]'' and Howard Hawks's ''[[Rio Bravo (film)|Rio Bravo]]'' led to unsubstantiated claims of alcoholism. Martin starred in and co-produced four [[Matt Helm]] [[spy film|superspy]] comedy adventures during this time, as well as a number of [[Westerns]]. By the early 1970s, ''The Dean Martin Show'' was still earning solid ratings, and although he was no longer a Top 40 hitmaker, his record albums continued to sell. He found a way to make his passion for golf profitable by offering a signature line of golf balls, and the [[Dean Martin Tucson Open]] was an event on golf's [[PGA Tour]] from 1972 to 1975. At his death, Martin was reportedly the single largest minority shareholder of RCA stock.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nMartin began reducing his schedule once comfortable financially. The final (1973–1974) season of his variety show was retooled into one of celebrity [[Roast (comedy)|roasts]], requiring less involvement. In the roasts, Martin and his panel of pals made fun of a variety of popular entertainment, athletic, and political figures.{{sfn|Tosches|1992|pp=413–414}} After the show's cancellation, NBC continued to air ''[[The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast]]'' as a series of TV specials through 1984.{{sfn|Tosches|1992|p=517}}\n\n===Later career===\n[[File:Dean Martin portrait (from Ada trailer).jpg|thumb|upright|right|Martin in the film ''[[Ada (1961 film)|Ada]]'' (1961)]]\nFor nearly a decade, Martin had recorded as many as four albums a year for [[Reprise Records]]. Martin recorded his final Reprise album, ''[[Once in a While (Dean Martin album)|Once in a While]]'' in 1974, which was not issued until 1978. His final recordings were made for [[Warner Bros. Records]]. ''[[The Nashville Sessions (Dean Martin album)|The Nashville Sessions]]'' was released in 1983, from which he had a hit with \"(I Think That I Just Wrote) My First Country Song\", which was recorded with [[Conway Twitty]] and made a respectable showing on the country charts. A follow-up single, \"L.A. Is My Home\"/\"Drinking Champagne\", came in 1985. The 1974 film drama ''[[Mr. Ricco]]'' marked Martin's final starring role, in which he played a criminal defense lawyer.{{Citation needed|date=July 2023}}\n\nIn 1972, Martin filed for divorce from his second wife, Jeanne. A week later, his business partnership with the [[Riviera (hotel and casino)|Riviera]] hotel in [[Las Vegas]] dissolved amid reports of the casino's refusal to agree to Martin's request to perform only once a night. Martin joined the [[MGM Grand Hotel and Casino]], where he was the featured performer on the hotel's opening night of December 23, 1973, and Martin's contract required him to star in a film (''Mr. Ricco'') for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] studios.{{Citation needed|date=July 2023}}\n\nMartin also made a public reconciliation with Lewis on his [[The Jerry Lewis MDA Labor Day Telethon|partner's Labor Day telethon]], benefiting the [[Muscular Dystrophy Association]], in September 1976. Sinatra shocked Lewis by bringing Martin out on stage and as the two men embraced, the audience gave them a [[standing ovation]] and the phones lit up, resulting in one of the telethon's most profitable years up to that time. Lewis later reported the event was one of the three most memorable of his life. Lewis quipped, \"So, you working?\" Martin, playing drunk, replied that he was appearing \"at the 'Meggum{{'\"}} (meaning the MGM Grand Hotel). This, with the death of Martin's son [[Dean Paul Martin]] more than a decade later, helped bring the two men together. They maintained a quiet friendship, but only performed again once, on Martin's 72nd birthday in 1989.<ref name=\"Talevski\">{{cite book| last=Talevski| first=Nick| title=Knocking on Heaven's Door: Rock Obituaries| date=April 7, 2010| publisher=Omnibus Press| isbn=978-1-84609-091-2| page=399| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DykffzkFALoC&q=dean+paul+martin}}</ref>\n\nMartin returned to films briefly with appearances in the star-laden, critically panned but commercially successful ''[[The Cannonball Run]]'' and its sequel ''[[Cannonball Run II]]''.<ref>{{cite news |last=Canby |first=Vincent |date=June 20, 1981 |title='Cannonball Run' With Burt Reynolds |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/20/movies/cannonball-run-with-burt-reynolds.html |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=December 26, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Maslin |first=Janet |author-link=Janet Maslin |date=June 29, 1984 |title=SCREEN: Burt Reynolds In 'Cannonball Run II' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/29/movies/screen-burt-reynolds-in-cannonball-run-ii.html |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=December 26, 2016}}</ref> He also had a minor hit single with \"[[Since I Met You Baby (song)|Since I Met You Baby]]\" and made his first music video, which appeared on [[MTV]] and was created by Martin's youngest son, Ricci.
