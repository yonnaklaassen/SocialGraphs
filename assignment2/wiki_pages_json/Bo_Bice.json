Prior to auditioning for ''American Idol'', Bice released a solo album as well as a few albums with his bands while performing on the night club circuit.\n\nBice charted in 2005 at number two on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] with a rendition of \"[[Inside Your Heaven]]\" from ''American Idol''. He released the album ''[[The Real Thing (Bo Bice album)|The Real Thing]]'' after ''American Idol'' to minor success before being dropped by RCA Records. He started his own record label Sugar Money and subsequently released two more albums, ''[[See the Light (Bo Bice album)|See the Light]]'' and ''[[3 (Bo Bice album)|3]].'' He was also the lead singer of [[Blood, Sweat & Tears]] from 2013 until 2018.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bloodsweatandtears.com/ |title=Blood Sweat & Tears official web site |access-date=2014-10-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006092029/http://www.bloodsweatandtears.com/ |archive-date=2014-10-06 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Childhood ==\nBice was born in [[Huntsville, Alabama]] to Nancy and Harold Elwin Bice. His mother was a gospel singer as were his grandmother, great-grandmother, and aunts. Bice was [[nickname]]d \"Bogart\" as a newborn by his grandmother, \"Granny Madge\", because she thought he had \"[[Humphrey Bogart]] eyes\". His family continued to call him Bogart, but when Bice was in kindergarten he shortened it to \"Bo\" because he did not think Bogart was cool. Bice's parents divorced when he was very young, and his mother remarried years later. Bice grew up with his mother and step-father, Earle Downes, a Coca-Cola manager, step-sisters Jenny and Sharan Downes, and half-brother John Cohran. Bice has two other half-siblings, Candace and Matthew, on his biological father's side. The Downes family moved around the [[Southern United States|South]] frequently. They lived in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Alabama]], and [[Florida]], including the metro area of [[Atlanta]]. In 1990 when Bice was 14 years old they moved to England, as part of his step-father's European assignment with [[Coca-Cola]] in London.\n\nBice spent his teenage years living in [[Gerrards Cross]]. Bice attended [[London Central High School]], a [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] school primarily for children whose parents served in the military or worked at the U.S. Embassy. In high school, he carried his [[guitar]] everywhere and played [[American football|football]]. It was around this time when Bice worked with some English [[alternative rock]] musicians.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} He formed his first band, Spinning Jenny, while living there. Bice would have graduated in 1994, but in the fall of 1993, Bice dropped out of high school just before turning 18 to move back to Alabama, where he earned his [[GED]] and attended classes at [[Calhoun Community College]] from November 1996 to May 1997.\n\n== Career==\n===Career beginnings and ''American Idol'': 1997–2005===\nUpon leaving Calhoun and spending one semester at the [[University of North Alabama]] in [[Florence, Alabama|Florence]], Bice turned professional and performed in shows all across the United States, the United Kingdom, [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], and Europe. He was a veteran of the [[nightclub]] circuit, releasing his first CD in 1995 with his band Purge.<ref>{{cite web |last=Ortega |first=Shawna |url=http://www.songfacts.com/int/2008/08/bo-bice.html |title=Bo Bice: Songwriter Interviews |publisher=Songfacts |date=2008-07-23 |access-date=October 5, 2008 |archive-date=October 18, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091018125127/http://www.songfacts.com/int/2008/08/bo-bice.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> His other pre-''Idol'' bands include Blue Suede Nickel and [[Sugar Money (band)|SugarMoney]].

Bice had recorded other albums prior to his stint on ''American Idol'', which included ''Ex Gratia'' (1999) with his band Purge, and ''Recipe for Flavor'' (2000) with SugarMoney. In 2001, Bice was charged with purchasing [[cocaine]] at a [[strip club]]. In 2003, Bice was arrested for possession of [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]], [[drug paraphernalia]] and [[public intoxication]]. He avoided jail time by agreeing to enter a [[drug rehabilitation|drug program]].<ref>[https://archive.today/20120906201505/http://www.popcrunch.com/busted-100-celebrities-arrested-for-drug-possession/Busted! 100 Celebrities Arrested For Drug Possession] from PopCrunch.com</ref><ref>[http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/0427051_bo_bice_american_idol_1.html \"Idol\" Finalist Dodged Cocaine, Pot Raps] from ''[[The Smoking Gun]]''</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1500954/20050428/id_0.jhtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502050128/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1500954/20050428/id_0.jhtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 2, 2008 |title='Idol' Singer Bo Bice Has Drug Rap Sheet, Court Papers Show |publisher=MTV News}}</ref>\n\nFor the 2005 season, ''Idol'' producers raised their required age limit from 16–24 to 16–28. In August 2004, Bice’s mother and several other family members encouraged him to go try out, since he was within the eligible age limit (he would turn 29 in November 2004). Along with [[Constantine Maroulis]] and [[Taylor Hicks]] (winner of Season 5), Bice was one of the oldest contestants to audition and participate on ''American Idol''.

His later performances established him as one of the favorites in the competition. During the final three performance show, Bice took the risk of performing without a band or backup singers. He sang \"In a Dream\", an obscure song recorded by [[Badlands (American band)|Badlands]].\n\nIn June 2005, Bice was quoted in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine that his last thought during the ''Idol'' finale was, \"Please, God, don't let me win this thing.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2002&dat=20050616&id=7L8iAAAAIBAJ&sjid=E7YFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5114,4458921 |title=Bice: 'Please, God, Don't Let Me Win This Thing.' |work=Beaver County Times |date=2005-06-15 |via=Google News Archive Search}}</ref> In comments during a subsequent appearance on ''[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]]'', Bice backed off this stance a bit, saying that he thanked all those who had voted for him.

The single debuted at number two on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 Chart and number one on the ''Billboard'' Hot Single Sales chart. Bice's single replaced [[Carrie Underwood]]'s version of the same song at number one. It was [[Gold certification|certified Gold]] in late July 2005.

On August 18, Bice, who had been suffering from stomach pain for months, was rushed to the hospital for emergency intestinal surgery to remove a blockage caused by a life-threatening intestinal condition called [[intussusception (medical disorder)|intussusception]]. He was sidelined from the tour for several shows. During his absence from the tour, fellow contestants Anwar, Nikko, Scott, Anthony and Constantine paid tribute to Bice by singing \"[[Sweet Home Alabama (song)|Sweet Home Alabama]]\" and wearing Bo Bice T-shirts.<ref>[http://www.foxesonidol.com/cgi-bin/ae.pl?mode=1&article=article1763.art&page=1 foxes on idol] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051016204318/http://www.foxesonidol.com/cgi-bin/ae.pl?mode=1&article=article1763.art&page=1 |date=October 16, 2005 }}</ref> Bice returned to the tour for the final two concerts in [[Syracuse, New York]], September 10 and September 11 (a [[benefit concert]] with proceeds going to the [[American Red Cross]] to help victims of [[Hurricane Katrina]]). In addition to playing that concert, he opened his home in Helena, Alabama to a family displaced by Hurricane Katrina.\n\nOn October 7, 2005, Bice introduced his own band, SugarMoney, in [[Mobile, Alabama]] at [[Bayfest (Mobile)|Bayfest]]. He performed two concerts the following week, including a benefit concert for the victims of Hurricane Katrina, but was back in the hospital the next day with surgery complications. In November Bice was named \"Heartland Hero of the Week\" on [[John Kasich]]'s show, ''[[Heartland with John Kasich|Heartland]]'', for giving up his house to the family displaced by Hurricane Katrina and for using his music to raise money for victims of Hurricane Katrina. [[Jim Croce]]'s family awarded Bice the \"Jim Croce 20th Annual Music Award\" because the Croce family had been greatly moved by Bice's performance of Croce's song \"Time in a Bottle\" while he was a contestant on ''American Idol''.\n\n===''The Real Thing'' and recurring medical problems: 2005–2006===\nBice's solo debut album, ''[[The Real Thing (Bo Bice album)|The Real Thing]]'', was released on December 13, 2005. It opened at number four. ''The Real Thing'' has the seventh-highest opening for a debut album by an ''American Idol'' finalist. Bice's band at the time appears with him on three tracks on ''The Real Thing'''s DualDisc version. In January 2006, [[Country Music Television|CMT]] aired an hour-long TV special—called ''Bo Bice: In the Moment''—which chronicled Bice's life post-Idol during the recording of his album, ''The Real Thing''. Their cameras had followed Bice around for months during the making of his album. The film showed both his joy with making an album and his frustration with recording other people's pop songs. The cameras also captured the birth of his son, Aidan. On December 18, Bice started [[coughing up blood]] while rehearsing for a performance on the 2005 [[Radio Music Awards]], and had to miss the show.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.upi.com/NewsTrack/Entertainment/2005/12/19/bo_bice_out_of_radio_music_awards/7382/ |title=Top News, Latest headlines, Latest News, World News & U.S News |work=United Press International |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124151135/http://www.upi.com/NewsTrack/Entertainment/2005/12/19/bo_bice_out_of_radio_music_awards/7382/ |archive-date=2009-01-24}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2006, Bice kicked off a radio promo tour. During the ensuing year of promotional appearances and touring, Bice continued to suffer with the recurring intestinal condition which had not been repaired by the August 2005 surgery. In the span of just a few months during his various tours, Bice was hospitalized 20 times, checking out of the hospitals each time to honor his performance commitments. In March 2006, Bice sang on the ''American Idol'' Top 16 Results Show. In April 2006, Bice was one of the celebrity drivers featured in the [[Toyota Pro/Celebrity Race]] held in [[Long Beach, California]], that was sponsored by [[Toyota]] to benefit various children's hospitals of Southern California. On September 12, 2006, Bice released a cover of [[The Chambers Brothers]] 1968 smash hit, \"[[Time Has Come Today]]\", which was the theme song for a new [[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]] commercial. In September 2006, Bice was a special guest star in a TV special called ''Decades Rock Live: Lynyrd Skynyrd & Friends''—the friends being Bice, [[Hank Williams Jr.]], and [[3 Doors Down]].\n\nOn October 5, 2006, Bice underwent emergency surgery in [[Nashville, Tennessee]] to correct his recurring intestinal problem. The surgery came after several rounds of tests and doctors deemed his condition serious enough to operate immediately. The day after that surgery, a complication occurred and Bice had to undergo another surgery. During the subsequent recovery time, [[Ben Stiller]] invited Bice to record for the [[Will Ferrell]] film ''[[Blades of Glory]]'' produced by Stiller. Bice made several promotional appearances in connection with the releases. Bice was presented with a [[Music recording sales certification|gold record]] for ''The Real Thing'' not long after [[RCA]] dropped Bice from its roster.\n\n=== Sugar Money Records, ''See The Light'' and ''3'': 2007–2013 ===\nIn the spring and summer of 2006, Bice began to talk of his hopes for a second CD, saying that \"[he]'d like to go more rootsy, more country, more southern rock Bo.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.semissourian.com/story/1167395.html |title=seMissourian.com: Entertainment: Banking on Bo (09/08/06) |work=seMissourian.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061017223120/http://www.semissourian.com/story/1167395.html |archive-date=2006-10-17}}</ref> Bice encouraged his fans to start a petition asking [[Clive Davis]] for Bo's original southern rock songs on a subsequent CD. The Grassroots Coalition to Hear More Bo started the online Petition to Hear More Bo, which collected over 5,300 signatures before it was closed February 21, 2007, after word broke that Bice was no longer with RCA. Bice subsequently formed his own record label called Sugar Money/StratArt (in partnership with [[Strategic Artist Management]]). He spent the next few months planning, writing, and recording music for his new album, ''[[See the Light (Bo Bice album)|See the Light]]''. Bice introduced many of his newly written songs on a short acoustic tour which began in May 2007 and ended a few weeks later with his hospitalization for flu and bronchitis. ''[[See the Light (Bo Bice album)|See the Light]]'' was released October 23, 2007.\n\n[[File:Bo Bice Share the Beat Atlanta 2008.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Bice in September 2008]]\nIn October 2007, Bice made an appearance on the TV show ''[[American Chopper|American Chopper: The Series]]'' in an episode which featured a custom-built Peavey Bike with a built-in guitar, microphone, and amp. [[Peavey Electronics|Peavey Electronics Corporation]] and Bice were working together to develop a Bo Bice guitar for their line of products. Bice had made appearances in Peavey Electronics Corporation's after school programs (in conjunction with National Afterschool Alliance) during which Peavey donated instruments to schools. In February 2008, Bice traveled to [[Kuwait]] and [[Afghanistan]] to perform for U.S. troops deployed in the region, and to thank them for their service. He went back to the war region in Fall 2008. During Spring and Summer 2008, Bice continued his tour promoting his ''See the Light'' album. He simultaneously spent a few weeks participating in a special tour called ''It Was Forty Years Ago Today'' with [[Todd Rundgren]], [[Denny Laine]], [[Lou Gramm]], and [[Christopher Cross]]. The tour paid tribute to the fortieth anniversary of the release of the [[Beatles]]' ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band|Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''.\n\nOn September 13, Bice participated in \"Share the Beat\", a benefit for the Georgia Transplant Foundation and the James Redford Institute for Transplant Awareness. Bice sang two tracks on the ''Brothers of the Southland'' CD,<ref>[http://www.southernfriedmagazine.com/magazine/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=185&mode=thread&order=0&thold=0 Southern Fried Magazine'' August 1, 2007]</ref> a compilation spearheaded by [[The Marshall Tucker Band]]'s [[George McCorkle]] who had died from cancer just days prior to the recording sessions. On December 2, Bice was invited to Washington to perform for President Bush. Throughout 2009, Bice continued touring to support ''See the Light''. Bice did tour dates with Lynyrd Skynyrd. Bice was honored with the prestigious Lifetime Presidential Volunteer Service Award for volunteering more than 4,000 hours of his time for worthy causes, such as [[Habitat for Humanity]], Katrina assistance, [[muscular dystrophy]], organ transplants, two concert tours for the military troops in Iraq, Kuwait, and Afghanistan, Safe House, and many others.
