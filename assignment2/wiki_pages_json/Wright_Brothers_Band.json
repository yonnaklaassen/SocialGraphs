They perform songs from the 1920s to the present day, and can cover bluegrass, pop standards, country, gospel, and even [[Aerosmith]] rock standards.  The band briefly gained national attention with their patriotic song \"Made in the U.S.A.\", which celebrated companies that continued to manufacture their products in the [[United States]]. They performed on the ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'', ''[[The Today Show]]'' and appeared 12 times on ''[[Nashville Now]]''. Signed with [[Warner Bros.]] and [[Mercury Records]] in the 1980s, the Wright Brothers had nine singles reach ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]''{{'}}s Hot Country Singles chart. The band also recorded ''Shot Down in Hot Blood'' and a cover of \"[[Jim Dandy (song)|Jim Dandy]]\" for the soundtrack of the 1987 [[Goldie Hawn]] movie ''[[Overboard (1987 film)|Overboard]]'', in which they also made a live appearance.<ref>{{citation \n | url= https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093693/soundtrack \n | title=Soundtracks for Overboard (1987) \n | accessdate=2010-09-09 \n | publisher = [[Internet Movie Database]] \n}}</ref>\n\nThe band's first three albums, ''Cornfield Cowboys'', ''Memorabilia Box'', and ''Third Phonograph Album'', were collected into a box set called ''Anthology'', first on vinyl and then on CD. ''Memorabilia Box'' featured live medleys of [[Harry Nilsson]]'s \"The Rainmaker\" with their own \"Dawson\", [[Mickey Newbury]]'s \"An American Trilogy\" (Battle Hymn of the Republic/Dixie/All My Trials), and [[Neil Diamond]]'s \"Solaimon/Brother Love\".\n\n==Discography==\n===Albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
