Active from 1962 to 2019, Raven has recorded for several record labels, including [[ABC Records|ABC]], Dimension, [[Elektra Records|Elektra]], [[RCA Records|RCA]], [[Universal Records (1988)|Universal]], and [[Capitol Records]]. After multiple albums which yielded few hit songs, his greatest commercial success came between 1984 and 1990, during which time Raven achieved six number-one singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts. These were \"[[I Got Mexico]]\", \"[[Shine, Shine, Shine]]\", \"[[I'm Gonna Get You (Billy Swan song)|I'm Gonna Get You]]\", \"[[Joe Knows How to Live]]\", \"[[A Letter to You|In a Letter to You]]\", and \"[[Bayou Boys]]\". Raven has a total of eighteen top-ten hits on that chart. Although his chart success diminished in the 1990s, Raven continued to record throughout the 1990s and into the 21st century. In addition to his own work, he has written singles for [[Don Gibson]], [[Randy Cornor]], [[Jeannie C. Riley]], [[Connie Smith]], and [[The Oak Ridge Boys]] among others. Raven's music is defined by mainstream country, [[country pop]], [[Cajun music]], and [[reggae]], and he wrote a large number of his singles by himself or with [[Frank J. Myers]].\n\n==Biography==\nEdward Garvin Futch was born in [[Lafayette, Louisiana]], on August 19, 1944.<ref name=\"whitburn\"/><ref name=\"Larkin2006\"/> He is the oldest of ten children, and his father worked as a truck driver.<ref name=\"pennies\">{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/112678145/ | title=Eddy Raven to perform at 'Pennies' | work=[[The Tennessean]] | date=December 15, 1982 | access-date=April 23, 2019 | author=Sandy Neese | pages=45}}{{subscription required}}</ref> Futch had originally considered a professional career in baseball, but chose not to after breaking his ankle.<ref name=\"gladys\">{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/229175341/ | title=Has the country boy caught up with the dream? | work=Daily World | date=January 18, 1981 | access-date=December 28, 2019 | author=Gladys L. deVillier | pages=C1}}{{Subscription required}}</ref> Growing up, he cited [[Cajun music]] as a musical influence, along with the [[country music]] sounds from popular radio broadcasts such as the ''[[Louisiana Hayride]]'', [[New Orleans blues]], and the new sounds of [[rock and roll]].

According to Raven, Bowen was the first record producer he encountered who was willing to let him record \"my music, not what the record company wanted me to cut.\"<ref name=\"pennies\"/> His only Elektra album, ''[[Desperate Dreams]]'', came out late that year. The album accounted for four chart singles on Hot Country Songs between 1981 and 1982: \"[[I Should've Called]]\", \"[[Who Do You Know in California]]\", \"[[A Little Bit Crazy]]\", and \"[[She's Playing Hard to Forget]]\", the last of which became his first top ten hit there. Raven wrote the first three by himself.<ref name=\"whitburn\"/> At the time of the album's release, Raven said that many of his songs were inspired by situations that he had encountered while touring. Specifically, he stated that \"Who Do You Know in California\" was inspired by an extramarital affair he had heard of in [[Dallas, Texas]], but changed to being set in [[California]] because the latter fit the song's meter better. A concert review in ''[[The Arizona Republic]]'' noted of Raven's style at the time that his style had potential for pop crossovers, while also stating that the song showed his lyrical skill by not resolving its central theme.<ref name=\"republic\">{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/121262933 | title=Eddy Raven is durable in any mode | work=[[The Arizona Republic]] | date=April 27, 1982 | access-date=April 23, 2019 | pages=D5}}{{subscription required}}</ref> ''Record World'' wrote of the album that Raven's \"commercial potential has not yet been reached\", while praising the vocal delivery on the singles.<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Record-World/80s/81/RW-1981-10-10.pdf | title=Country album picks | journal=Record World | pages=55 | date=October 10, 1981}}</ref> Tom Roland of ''[[Allmusic]]'' thought that the album had more creative control from Raven than its predecessors did.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/desperate-dreams-mw0000857038 | title=''Desperate Dreams'' | work=Allmusic | access-date=April 23, 2019 | author=Tom Roland}}</ref> At the end of his contract with Elektra, Raven had a second album recorded but never released,<ref name=\"virgin\">{{cite book | title=The Virgin Encyclopedia of Country Music | publisher=Virgin Books | author=Colin Larkin | year=1998 | pages=349 | isbn=0-7535-0236-4}}</ref> although it did have one charted single in \"San Antonio Nights\".<ref name=\"whitburn\"/> Once his contract ended, Raven chose to undergo a brief recording hiatus in order to determine the viability of his career. During this hiatus, he disassociated himself from his existing producers and managers and began writing songs with [[Frank J. Myers]], a songwriter who was also the guitarist and bandleader of his road band. After having success on the songwriting front, which included the title track of [[Tanya Tucker]]'s late-1982 album ''[[Changes (Tanya Tucker album)|Changes]]'', Raven was inspired to resume recording in 1984.<ref name=\"robert\"/>\n\n===1984-88: RCA Records===\n[[File:Frank Myers 190306-D-SW162-1180 (47257966602).jpg|200px|thumb|right|[[Frank J.
