The band currently consists of [[Robin Pecknold]] (vocals, guitar), Skyler Skjelset (guitar, mandolin, backing vocals), Casey Wescott (keyboards, mandolin, backing vocals), [[Christian Wargo]] (bass, guitar, backing vocals), and Morgan Henderson (upright bass, guitar, woodwinds, violin, percussion, saxophone). Founding members Pecknold and Skjelset have been the only constants through the group's history, with the former serving as leader and principal songwriter.\n\nThe band came to prominence in 2008 with the release of their second EP ''[[Sun Giant]]'' and their [[Fleet Foxes (album)|eponymous debut album]] on [[Sub Pop]], both of which met with widespread critical acclaim. Their sophomore album ''[[Helplessness Blues]]'' (2011) earned further praise and became their greatest commercial success to date, reaching number 4 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. Following a three-year break, Fleet Foxes reconvened in 2016 to record their third album ''[[Crack-Up (album)|Crack-Up]]'', which was released the following year on [[Nonesuch Records]]. This was followed by 2020's ''[[Shore (album)|Shore]]'', a ''de facto'' Pecknold solo album made without the involvement of his bandmates and released through the [[Anti- (record label)|Anti-]] label.\n\nThough the group has experienced limited commercial success, their work has been consistently lauded by [[music critics]], who have praised their lyricism and production style and often noted the band's use of refined instrumentation and vocal harmonies. The band's debut album was ranked by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' among the best of the decade and was also included in the book ''[[1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die]]''. The band has been nominated for two [[Grammy Awards]], the first for [[Grammy Award for Best Folk Album|Best Folk Album]] in 2012 for ''Helplessness Blues'' and the second for [[Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album|Best Alternative Music Album]] in 2022 for ''Shore''.\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation and early years (2005–06)===\n[[Robin Pecknold]] and Skyler Skjelset both attended [[Lake Washington High School]] in [[Kirkland, Washington|Kirkland]], a suburb of Seattle, and soon became close friends.

However, funds for recording were tight, so the band members cobbled together what funds they had, which limited the time they had in the studio, and so the majority of the tracks were recorded in various band members' apartments, other spaces, or the basement of Pecknold's parents' house.<ref name=RSHarmony/>\n\n===''Sun Giant'' and ''Fleet Foxes'' (2007–08)===\n[[File:Fleetfoxes08.jpg|thumb|left|260px|Fleet Foxes performing in [[Copenhagen]], 2008.]]\nFleet Foxes were becoming increasingly popular and by late 2007, they had attracted over a quarter of a million song plays over two months on their [[Myspace]] site.<ref name=\"Lester\">{{cite web |last=Lester |first=Paul |title=No 272: Fleet Foxes |work=The Guardian |date=February 11, 2008 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/feb/11/popandrock1 |access-date=December 3, 2008}}</ref> Although the band had not released any of their recordings, they benefited from [[word of mouth]] exposure and their success soon translated into a record deal, signing with [[Warner Music Group|Warner Music]] subsidiary record label [[Sub Pop]] on January 18, 2008.<ref name=\"Lester\"/> The band's frontman, Robin Pecknold, attributes much of their success and popularity to illegal [[file sharing]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Youngs |first=Ian |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/8097324.stm |title=Entertainment &#124; Bands 'better because of piracy' |work=BBC News |date=June 12, 2009|access-date=July 5, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe band tracked their second EP, ''[[Sun Giant]]'', at [[Bear Creek Studio]] and performed overdubs and mixed at Seattle's [[Avast!

Which we all weakly agreed to going through with, but it quickly became obvious he'd rather have just been doing that project instead, and I would have rathered that as well.
