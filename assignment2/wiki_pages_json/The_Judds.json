The duo signed to [[RCA Records]] in 1983 and released six studio albums between then and 1991. The Judds were one of the most successful acts in country music history, winning five [[Grammy Awards]] for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, and nine [[Country Music Association]] awards. They also charted more than twenty singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts, including fourteen that went to number one. After eight years as a duo, the Judds disbanded in 1991 after Naomi was diagnosed with [[hepatitis C]]. Wynonna began a highly successful solo career soon after, although she and her mother reunited on multiple occasions.\n\nAfter a long battle with physical and mental health issues, Naomi Judd died by suicide in 2022.\n\n==Early life and career==\nNaomi Judd was born Diana Ellen Judd on January 11, 1946, in [[Ashland, Kentucky]]. Growing up, she played piano at her local church.<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p1673|pure_url=yes}}|title=The Judds biography|last=Huey|first=Steve|work=[[Allmusic]]|access-date=4 October 2010}}</ref> At age 18,<ref name=naomiage /> she married Michael Ciminella and gave birth to her daughter Christina Ciminella, who would later change her name to [[Wynonna Judd]];<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> though Ciminella was regarded as Wynonna's father,<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> in truth, Naomi had conceived Wynonna out of wedlock with an ex-boyfriend named Charles Jordan.<ref name=naomiage>{{cite news|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/ashley-judd-claims-incest-abuse-memoir-trauma-judd/story?id=13268661|title=Ashley Judd's Story of Abuse Echoes Family's Sad Narrative|first=Susan Donaldson|last=James|publisher=ABC News|date=April 1, 2011|accessdate=April 30, 2022}}</ref> After Diana's parents divorced, she and her daughter moved to [[Los Angeles]] in 1968, and lived on welfare after she and Michael divorced in 1972.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> By 1979, Diana and her daughter moved to Tennessee. Diana renamed herself Naomi and began playing music with her daughter, who sang lead and played guitar. At the same time, Naomi began studying to be a [[nursing|nurse]].<ref name=\"allmusic\"/>\n\nNaomi was a promoter of the act and was reportedly propositioned, [[sexually harassed]], and dismissed when she tried to do so. She submitted a cassette tape produced for $30 to Nashville music producers and to anyone who would listen. In 1983, Naomi met the daughter of record producer [[Brent Maher]], who was able to secure the Judds an audition with executives of [[RCA Records]]. These executives signed the duo immediately upon hearing their audition.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/><ref>{{cite book|last1=Bufwack|first1=Mary|title=Finding Her Voice, The Saga of Women in Country Music|date=1993|publisher=Crown Publishers|location=New York|isbn=0-517-58114-0|page=[https://archive.org/details/findinghervoices00bufw/page/495 495]|edition=First|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/findinghervoices00bufw/page/495}}</ref>\n\n==Musical career==\nThe Judds' first release for RCA/Curb was an [[extended play]] titled ''[[Wynonna & Naomi]]''. The release consisted of six songs, two of which were issued as singles to promote it.

In mid-1984, this song became the first of eight consecutive No.&nbsp;1 singles for the duo on the country music charts, while also earning the duo its first [[Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]] the following year.<ref name=\"whitburn\"/>\n\nThe Judds' first full-length studio album, ''[[Why Not Me (album)|Why Not Me]]'', was issued in 1984. Steve Huey of [[Allmusic]] wrote that the album \"took its place as a classic of modern country, establishing the Judds as spokeswomen for a new generation of female country music fans.\"<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> Three singles were issued from it: the [[Why Not Me (The Judds song)|title track]], which earned a second Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, followed by \"[[Girls' Night Out (The Judds song)|Girls Night Out]]\" and \"[[Love Is Alive (The Judds song)|Love Is Alive]]\".<ref name=\"whitburn\"/> The album went on to sell a million copies in the United States.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/>\n\n''[[Rockin' with the Rhythm]]'' (1985) accounted for four more singles. First was \"[[Have Mercy (The Judds song)|Have Mercy]]\", which held the No.&nbsp;1 position on Hot Country Songs for two weeks, making it their only song to hold that position for more than a single week.<ref name=\"whitburn\"/> \"[[Grandpa (Tell Me 'Bout the Good Ol' Days)]]\" came next. Released in February 1985, the song won both a third Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, along with [[Grammy Award for Best Country Song]], both awarded in 1987.<ref name=\"whitburn\"/> Following these were \"[[Rockin' with the Rhythm of the Rain]]\" and \"[[Cry Myself to Sleep]]\".<ref name=\"allmusic\"/>\n\n1987's ''[[Heartland (The Judds album)|Heartland]]'' was led off by another Elvis Presley cover, specifically \"[[Don't Be Cruel]]\", featuring backing vocals from [[The Jordanaires]].<ref name=\"whitburn\"/> Huey described this album as more \"uneven\" than its predecessors.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> \"[[I Know Where I'm Going (The Judds song)|I Know Where I'm Going]]\", \"[[Maybe Your Baby's Got the Blues]]\", and \"[[Turn It Loose]]\" were also released from this compilation, followed in 1988 by two tracks off their ''[[Greatest Hits (The Judds album)|Greatest Hits]]'' package: \"[[Give a Little Love (The Judds song)|Give a Little Love]]\" and \"[[Change of Heart (The Judds song)|Change of Heart]]\" (written by Naomi), the latter of which accounted for their fourth Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal.<ref name=\"whitburn\"/>\n\n===1988 until disbanding===\n''[[River of Time (The Judds album)|River of Time]]'', issued in 1989, became their first disc not to reach the summit of the Top Country Albums charts. Despite its lower sales, it accounted for their last No&nbsp;1 hits \"[[Young Love (Strong Love)]]\" and \"[[Let Me Tell You About Love]]\",<ref name=\"whitburn\"/> the latter of which featured [[Carl Perkins]] on lead guitar. The later singles were less successful, with \"[[Guardian Angels (The Judds song)|Guardian Angels]]\" becoming their first single since \"Had a Dream\" not to make the Top 10 of the country charts.<ref name=\"whitburn\"/>\n\nHuey noted that at this point in the Judds' career, the personalities of Wynonna and Naomi began to differ. According to [[Allmusic]]: \"Naomi was the extroverted stage presence, the sometime songwriter, the ambitious businesswoman who steered the group's career and pushed her daughter to keep realizing her talent. Wynonna--despite her quiet, reserved demeanor--was a prodigiously talented vocal stylist who grew surer of herself with every passing release and rebelled more and more forcefully against her mother's direction.\"<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> Amid speculation that the two would disband, they released their last full studio album, ''[[Love Can Build a Bridge (album)|Love Can Build a Bridge]]'', in 1990. From it came \"[[Born to Be Blue (The Judds song)|Born to Be Blue]]\" and the [[Love Can Build a Bridge|title track]], written by Naomi along with [[Paul Overstreet]] and [[John Barlow Jarvis]]. \"Love Can Build a Bridge\" was also their last single to receive Grammy Awards, once again for Country Song and Best Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal.<ref name=\"whitburn\"/> This album was promoted by a farewell tour.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> Ending the original segment of their career was ''[[Greatest Hits Volume Two (The Judds album)|Greatest Hits Volume Two]]'' (1991). It also accounted for the single \"[[John Deere Tractor (song)|John Deere Tractor]]\", originally found on ''Wynonna & Naomi''.<ref name=\"whitburn\"/>\n\nThe Judds decided to say goodbye to their fans with a Farewell Tour in 1991, culminating in a date on Dec. 4 at the Murphy Center in Murfreesboro, Tenn., that was filmed for a TV special titled The Judds: Their Final Concert. The special performance includes appearances from Carl Perkins, [[Reba McEntire]], and [[Larry Gatlin]], and it features an emotional moment in which Naomi urges Wynonna, who had already announced her intention to launch a solo career, to \"go toward the light\" as she takes her own path forward.<ref name=\"Taste Of Country article\">{{cite web |last1=Whitaker |first1=Sterling |title=Remember When the Judds Played Their 'Final Show'? |url=https://tasteofcountry.com/the-judds-final-concert-1991/ |website=Taste Of Country |date=December 4, 2021 |access-date=5 May 2023}}</ref>\n\nFollowing their disbanding, Wynonna Judd signed to [[MCA Records]] and [[Curb Records]] between 1992 and 1997, followed by just Curb from then onward. She charted over 25 singles on her own, including four that went to No.&nbsp;1 on the Hot Country Songs charts. These included her first three releases, \"[[She Is His Only Need]]\", \"[[I Saw the Light (Wynonna Judd song)|I Saw the Light]]\", and \"[[No One Else on Earth]]\" all in 1992, along with \"[[To Be Loved by You (Wynonna Judd song)|To Be Loved by You]]\" in 1996.<ref>Whitburn, p. 383</ref>\n\n==Reunion shows==\nWynonna and Naomi briefly reunited for a performance at the [[Super Bowl XXVIII]] halftime show.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/super-bowl-halftime-shows-ranked-from-worst-to-best-20140128/16-tanya-tucker-clint-black-travis-tritt-and-the-judds-1994-0013556|title=16.

The 23 song set was released as ''[[The Judds Reunion Live]]'' and features Naomi's husband, Larry Strickland producing. \n\nIn 2008, the Judds once again reunited for a concert at the 2008 [[Stagecoach Festival]] in [[Indio, California]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/music/news/article_1373760.php/The_Judds_reunite_for_2008_Stagecoach_Festival|title=The Judds reunite for 2008 Stagecoach Festival|website=monstersandcritics.com|access-date=6 April 2018|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819125616/http://www.monstersandcritics.com/music/news/article_1373760.php/The_Judds_reunite_for_2008_Stagecoach_Festival|archive-date=19 August 2014}}</ref> as well as two shows in Canada, including one at the world-famous [[Calgary Stampede]] and another at the Merritt Mountain Music Festival in [[Merritt, British Columbia]].
