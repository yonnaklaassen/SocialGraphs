He was a pioneering figure in the [[outlaw country]] movement of the 1970s, moving away from the polished [[Nashville sound]] and toward a more raw, introspective style. He was a three-time [[Grammy Awards|Grammy Award]] winner, out of 13 total nominations.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Kris Kristofferson {{!}} Artist {{!}} GRAMMY.com |url=https://www.grammy.com/artists/kris-kristofferson/9938 |access-date=2024-10-01 |website=grammy.com |archive-date=October 1, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20241001063253/https://www.grammy.com/artists/kris-kristofferson/9938 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nHe released his debut album ''[[Kristofferson (album)|Kristofferson]]'' in 1970.

He was also nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Original Score]] for the film [[Songwriter (film)|''Songwriter'']] (1984). His acting career waned somewhat following his role in the [[box office bomb]] ''[[Heaven's Gate (film)|Heaven's Gate]]'' (1980), but he continued to act in films such as ''[[Stagecoach (1986 film)|Stagecoach]]'' (1986), ''[[Lone Star (1996 film)|Lone Star]]'' (1996), and the [[Blade (franchise)|''Blade'' film trilogy]] (1998–2004). \n\n== Early life and education ==\nKristoffer Kristofferson was born in [[Brownsville, Texas]], to Mary Ann (née Ashbrook) and Lars Henry Kristofferson, a [[United States Army Air Corps|U.S. Army Air Corps]] officer (later a [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] [[major general]]).<ref name=\"Times, San Mateo\">{{cite news |title=Death claims famed pilot |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/52168909/henry-christopher-kristofferson/ |access-date=May 26, 2020 |work=The Times |date=January 4, 1971 |location=San Mateo, California |page=3 |quote=Henry C.

Country music performer [[Kenny Rogers]] recorded some of Kristofferson's songs, including a version of \"Me and Bobby McGee\" in 1969 with [[Kenny Rogers and the First Edition|the First Edition]] for the ''[[Ruby, Don't Take Your Love to Town (album)|Ruby, Don't Take Your Love To Town]]'' album.{{citation needed|date=September 2024}}\n\nKristofferson released his second album—''[[The Silver Tongued Devil and I]]''—in 1971. It included \"[[Lovin' Her Was Easier (than Anything I'll Ever Do Again)]]\". This success established Kristofferson's career as a recording artist. Soon after, Kristofferson made his acting debut in ''[[The Last Movie]]'' (directed by [[Dennis Hopper]]), and appeared at the [[Isle of Wight Festival 1970|Isle of Wight Festival]]. A portion of his Isle of Wight performance is featured on the three disc compilation, ''The First Great Rock Festivals of the Seventies''. In 1971, he acted in ''[[Cisco Pike]]'', and released his third album, ''[[Border Lord]]''. The album was all-new material and sales were sluggish. He also swept the [[Grammy Awards]] that year with numerous songs nominated, winning country song of the year for \"Help Me Make It Through the Night\". Kristofferson's 1972 fourth album, ''[[Jesus Was a Capricorn]]'', initially had slow sales, but the third single, \"[[Why Me (Kris Kristofferson song)|Why Me]]\", was a success and significantly increased album sales. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a [[Music recording certification|gold disc]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] on November 8, 1973.<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\">{{cite book| first= Joseph| last= Murrells| year= 1978| title= The Book of Golden Discs| edition= 2nd| publisher= Barrie and Jenkins Ltd| location= London| page= [https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/330 330]| isbn= 0-214-20512-6| url-access= registration| url= https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/330}}</ref>\n\nIn 1972, Kristofferson appeared with [[Rita Coolidge]] on British TV on BBC's ''[[The Old Grey Whistle Test]]'', performing \"Help Me Make It Through the Night\".

He appeared in ''[[Cisco Pike]]'' (1972) with [[Gene Hackman]]; ''[[Blume in Love]]'' (1973), directed by [[Paul Mazursky]]; three [[Sam Peckinpah]] films: ''[[Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid]]'' (1973), ''[[Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia]]'' (1974), and ''[[Convoy (1978 film)|Convoy]]'' (1978); and [[Michael Ritchie (filmmaker)|Michael Ritchie]]'s ''[[Semi-Tough]]'' (1977) with [[Burt Reynolds]]. He continued acting in [[Martin Scorsese]]'s ''[[Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore]]'' (1974), ''[[Vigilante Force]]'' (1976), ''[[The Sailor Who Fell from Grace with the Sea (film)|The Sailor Who Fell from Grace with the Sea]]'' (1976), and the romantic drama ''[[A Star Is Born (1976 film)|A Star Is Born]]'' (1976) with [[Barbra Streisand]], for which he received a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy|Golden Globe Award for Best Actor]]. At the peak of his box office power, Kristofferson turned down [[William Friedkin]]'s ''[[Sorcerer (film)|Sorcerer]]'' (1977) and the romantic war film ''[[Hanover Street (film)|Hanover Street]]'' (1979). Despite his success with Streisand, Kristofferson's solo musical career headed downward with his non-charting ninth album, ''[[Shake Hands with the Devil (album)|Shake Hands with the Devil]]''. His next film, the two-part 1979 [[NBC]]-TV movie ''[[Freedom Road]]'', did not get good ratings.{{citation needed|date=September 2024}}\n\nKristofferson was next cast in the lead role as the enigmatic Sheriff James Averill in [[Michael Cimino]]'s bleak and sprawling 1980 anti-Western ''[[Heaven's Gate (film)|Heaven's Gate]]''. Despite being a scandalous studio-bankrupting and industry-changing failure at the time (it cost Kristofferson his Hollywood A-list status), the film gained critical recognition in subsequent years. In 1981, he co-starred with [[Jane Fonda]] in ''[[Rollover (film)|Rollover]]'', directed by [[Alan J. Pakula]]. In 1986, he starred in ''[[The Last Days of Frank and Jesse James]]'' with Johnny Cash and [[Flashpoint (1984 film)|''Flashpoint'']] with [[Treat Williams]] in 1984, directed by William Tannen. This was followed, in 1985, by the [[neo-noir]] thriller ''[[Trouble in Mind (film)|Trouble In Mind]]'' co-starring [[Keith Carradine]] and [[Lori Singer]]. In 1987, Kristofferson starred in the seven-episode TV series ''[[Amerika (miniseries)|Amerika]]'' with [[Robert Urich]] and [[Christine Lahti]]. In 1989, he was the male lead in the film ''[[Millennium (film)|Millennium]]'' with [[Cheryl Ladd]]. In 1996, he earned a supporting role as Charlie Wade, a corrupt [[South Texas]] sheriff in [[John Sayles]]' ''[[Lone Star (1996 film)|Lone Star]]'', a film nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay]]. In 1997, he co-starred in the film ''[[Fire Down Below (1997 film)|Fire Down Below]]'' with [[Steven Seagal]].{{citation needed|date=September 2024}}\n\nIn 1998, Kristofferson took a role in the film ''[[Blade (1998 film)|Blade]]'', alongside [[Wesley Snipes]], as [[Blade (character)|Blade]]'s mentor [[Abraham Whistler]]. He reprised the role in ''[[Blade II]]'' (2002) and again in ''[[Blade: Trinity]]'' (2004). In 1998 he starred in ''[[Dance with Me (1998 film)|Dance with Me]]'' along with [[Vanessa Williams]] and [[Chayanne]]. In 1999, he co-starred with Mel Gibson in ''[[Payback (1999 film)|Payback]]''. He played rancher Rudolph Meyer in [[Molokai: The Story of Father Damien]] (1999). He was then in the 2001 [[Tim Burton]] version of ''[[Planet of the Apes (2001 film)|Planet of the Apes]]''. He also played the title character \"Yohan\" as an old man in the Norwegian film ''Yohan—the Children Wanderer''.  He co-starred in the 2011 film ''[[Dolphin Tale]]'' and its 2014 sequel, ''[[Dolphin Tale 2]]''. In 2012, Kristofferson was in ''[[Joyful Noise (film)|Joyful Noise]]'' with longtime friend [[Dolly Parton]].

They married in 1973 and released an album titled ''[[Full Moon (Kris Kristofferson and Rita Coolidge album)|Full Moon]]'', another success buoyed by numerous hit singles and Grammy nominations. His fifth album, ''[[Spooky Lady's Sideshow]]'', released in 1974, was a commercial failure, setting the trend for most of the rest of his musical career. Artists such as [[Ronnie Milsap]] and [[John Duncan (artist)|Johnny Duncan]] continued to record Kristofferson's material with success, but his distinctively rough voice and anti-pop sound kept his own audience to a minimum. Meanwhile, more artists took his songs to the top of the charts, including [[Willie Nelson]], whose 1979 LP release of ''[[Sings Kristofferson|(Willie Nelson) Sings Kristofferson]]'' reached number five on the U.S. Country Music chart and certified Platinum in the U.S.{{citation needed|date=September 2024}}\n\nIn 1979, Kristofferson traveled to [[Havana]], Cuba, to participate in the historic [[Havana Jam]] festival that took place on March 2–4, alongside Rita Coolidge, [[Stephen Stills]], the CBS Jazz All-Stars, the [[Trio of Doom]], [[Fania All-Stars]], [[Billy Swan]], [[Bonnie Bramlett]], [[Mike Finnigan]], [[Weather Report]], and [[Billy Joel]], plus an array of Cuban artists such as [[Irakere]], [[Pacho Alonso]], [[Tata Güines]], and [[Orquesta Aragón]]. His performance is captured on Ernesto Juan Castellanos's documentary ''Havana Jam '79''.{{citation needed|date=September 2024}}\n\nOn November 18, 1979, Kristofferson and Coolidge appeared on ''[[The Muppet Show]]'', where Kristofferson sang \"[[Help Me Make It Through the Night]]\" with [[Miss Piggy]], Coolidge sang \"[[We're All Alone]]\" with forest animals, and the pair sang \"[[Full Moon (Kris Kristofferson and Rita Coolidge album)|Song I'd Like to Sing]]\" with the Muppet monsters.

He married again, to Lisa Meyers, and concentrated on films for a time, appearing in the 1984 releases ''[[The Lost Honor of Kathryn Beck]]'', ''[[Flashpoint (1984 film)|Flashpoint]]'',  and ''[[Songwriter (film)|Songwriter]]''. Nelson and Kristofferson both appeared in ''Songwriter'', and Kristofferson was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Original Score]]. The album ''[[Music from Songwriter]]'', featuring Nelson-Kristofferson duets, was a country success.{{citation needed|date=September 2024}}\n\nNelson and Kristofferson continued their partnership, and added [[Waylon Jennings]] and [[Johnny Cash]] to form the [[supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[The Highwaymen (country supergroup)|the Highwaymen]]. Their first album, ''[[Highwayman (The Highwaymen album)|Highwayman]]'', was a success, and the supergroup continued working together for a time.

''[[Lone Star (1996 film)|Lone Star]]'' (1996 film by [[John Sayles]]) reinvigorated Kristofferson's acting career, and he soon appeared in ''[[Blade (1998 film)|Blade]]'', ''[[Blade II]]'', ''[[Blade: Trinity]]'', ''[[A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries (film)|A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries]]'', ''[[Fire Down Below (1997 film)|Fire Down Below]]'', [[Tim Burton]]'s remake of ''[[Planet of the Apes (2001 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'', ''[[Chelsea Walls]]'', ''[[Payback (1999 film)|Payback]]'', ''[[The Jacket]]'', and ''[[Fast Food Nation (film)|Fast Food Nation]]''.{{citation needed|date=September 2024}}\n\nThe [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] inducted Kristofferson in 1985, as had the [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]] earlier, in 1977. In 1999, ''[[The Austin Sessions (Kris Kristofferson album)|The Austin Sessions]]'' was released, an album on which Kristofferson reworked some of his favorite songs with the help of artists such as [[Mark Knopfler]], [[Steve Earle]], and [[Jackson Browne]].

The movie was inspired by the true story of the mare [[Mariah's Storm]] which won the Turfway Breeders Cup Classic. In 2006, he received the [[Johnny Mercer Award]] from the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] and released his first album full of new material in 11 years; ''[[This Old Road]]''.
