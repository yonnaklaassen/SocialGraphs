He made his debut in 2022 with the single \"How It Oughta Be\".\n\n==Biography==\nShane Profitt was born in [[Columbia, Tennessee]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/shane-profitt-mn0004225422/biography | title=Shane Profitt biography | publisher=AllMusic | accessdate=January 9, 2022 | author=James Christopher Monger}}</ref>\n\nProfitt began playing guitar in 2018 when his grandfather gave him one for Christmas. After this, he began learning to perform [[cover song]]s at local venues in addition to writing his own material. After encountering a woman at a guitar store, he took her on a date to a [[sushi]] restaurant where he met country music singer [[Chris Janson]] and his wife, Kelly, who is also his manager. The Jansons signed Profitt to a songwriting contract, which led to Janson recording two of his songs on his 2021 album ''All In''. He also selected Profitt as an opening act on his Halfway to Crazy tour.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://countrynow.com/country-next-shane-profitt/ | title=Country Next: Shane Profitt | publisher=Country Now | date=October 25, 2022 | accessdate=January 9, 2023 | author=Melissa Lorge}}</ref>\n\nThis led to Profitt signing with [[Big Machine Records]] along with Janson's imprint label, Harpeth 60 Records, in 2022.
