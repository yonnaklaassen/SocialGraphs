Active since 1948, he began his career as part of the duo [[Rusty and Doug]], along with his brother, [[Rusty Kershaw]]. He had an extensive solo career that included fifteen albums and singles that charted on the [[Hot Country Songs]] charts. He is also a member of the [[Louisiana Music Hall of Fame]], being inducted in 2009.\n\n== Early life ==\nBorn in an unincorporated community called Tiel Ridge in [[Cameron Parish, Louisiana|Cameron Parish]], Kershaw spoke [[Louisiana French]] and did not learn English until the age of eight. By that time, he had mastered the fiddle, which he played from the age of five, and was on his way to teaching himself to play 28 instruments.<ref name = \"CMT\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/kershaw_doug/bio.jhtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110529012212/http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/kershaw_doug/bio.jhtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 29, 2011 |title=Doug Kershaw Bio |publisher=Cmt.com |access-date=2015-10-17}}</ref> His first gig was at a local bar, the Bucket of Blood, where he was accompanied by his mother on guitar.<ref name=\"LouisianaRocks\">{{cite book|last1=Aswell|first1=Tom|title=Louisiana Rocks!: The True Genesis of Rock and Roll|date=2013|publisher=Pelican Publishing|isbn=9781455607839|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BSHTGsnI8skC&q=%22Doug+Kershaw%22+%2B+%22Bucket+of+Blood%22&pg=PA222|access-date=21 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nKershaw became interested in Cajun music during parties his parents would host on the family's [[houseboat]] in Louisiana, where he first heard Cajun bands playing the music.\n\n==\"Doug and Rusty\"==\nDoug grew up surrounded by [[Cajun music|Cajun]] fiddle and [[accordion]] music. After teaching his brother, Rusty, to play guitar, he formed a band, the Continental Playboys, with Rusty and older brother Nelson \"Peewee\" Kershaw in 1948.<ref name=\"LouisianaRocks\"/> With the departure of Peewee from the group, in the early 1950s, [[Rusty & Doug]] continued to perform as a duo. In 1955, when Kershaw was nineteen, he and Rusty performed on the ''[[Louisiana Hayride]]'' [[KWKH]] radio broadcast in [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]], Louisiana.<ref name=\"Stabler-p233\">{{cite book|last=Stambler|first=Irwin|title=Country Music: The Encyclopedia|year=2000|publisher=St. Martin's Griffin|edition=3rd|page=233|isbn=978-0312264871}}</ref> The two also performed at the WWVA Jamboree (later renamed [[Jamboree U.S.A.]]), in [[Wheeling, West Virginia|Wheeling]], West Virginia.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Dregni|first1=Michael|title=Rockabilly: The Twang Heard 'Round the World: The Illustrated History|date=2011|publisher=Voyageur Press|isbn=9780760340622|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=06VWZ69WBAEC&q=%22Doug+Kershaw%22+%2B+%22WWVA+jamboree%22&pg=PA144|access-date=21 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the brothers initially sang in French, [[J. D. \"Jay\" Miller]], owner of the [[Feature Records]] label, persuaded them to incorporate songs in English into their repertoire. In 1955, Doug and Rusty recorded their first single, \"So Lovely, Baby.\" Released on the Hickory label, the tune went to number 14 on the country music charts. Later that same year, Doug and Rusty were invited to become members of the ''[[Louisiana Hayride]]'' cast. The Kershaws appeared at the [[Grand Ole Opry]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]] and became regular members of the Opry cast the following year.<ref name = \"CMT\" /><ref>{{cite web\n| title = Opry Timeline – 1950s\n| url = http://www.opry.com/about/Timeline_1950.html\n| publisher = Opry.com\n| access-date = July 10, 2012\n| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190330032424/https://www.opry.com/about/Timeline_1950.html\n| archive-date = March 30, 2019\n| url-status = dead\n}}</ref>\nDespite the demands of his music career, Doug enrolled in [[McNeese State University]], in [[Lake Charles, Louisiana]], where he earned an [[undergraduate degree]] in Mathematics. At the peak of their early career, in 1958, Doug and Rusty both enlisted in the [[United States Army]]. They devoted their attention to the military until their discharge three years later.<ref name=\"LouisianaRocks\"/>\n\n== \"Louisiana Man\" and solo career ==\nAfter fulfilling their military obligation, the two brothers recorded \"[[Louisiana Man]]\", an autobiographical song that Doug had written while in the Army. The song not only sold millions of copies but over the years has come to be considered a standard of modern Cajun music.<ref name=\"Woodstra-p255\">{{cite book|last=Woodstra|first=Chris|title=All Music Guide to Country: The Experts' Guide to the Best Country Recordings|publisher=Backbeat Books|edition=1st|year=1997|page=255|isbn=978-0879304751}}</ref> The song was eventually [[cover version|covered]] by more than 800 artists.\n\nThere were three albums released by the duo on [[Hickory Records]], only one being released before they split up. The first was ''Rusty and Doug Sing Louisiana Man'' (LPM 103) in 1961. ''Kershaw (Genus Cambarus)'' (LPS 163) was released in 1972 and was a double LP. ''Louisiana Man'' (HR 4506) was the final Hickory album, released in 1974. By 1964, the brothers had elected to go their separate ways. It took another three years before Kershaw signed a songwriters' contract with BMI, in 1967.\n\nIn June 1969, Kershaw made his first network television appearance on the debut of the ''[[The Johnny Cash Show (TV series)|Johnny Cash Show]]''.<ref name=\"LouisianaRocks\"/> After watching Kershaw's ''Johnny Cash Show'' performance as an eight-year-old boy, [[Mark O'Connor]] became inspired to learn to play the fiddle.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1993/11/19/mark-oconnors-art-fiddling-with-the-best/ad489226-573c-4281-b521-c7aff4a63e5a/ |title=Mark O'Connor's Art: Fiddling With The Best |author=Himes, Geoffrey |work=washingtonpost.com |access-date=5 May 2022 }}</ref> He capped the year with a week-long engagement at the New York City's [[Fillmore East]] as opening act for [[Eric Clapton]]'s [[Derek and the Dominos]]. While it seemed to many rock and pop fans that Kershaw had appeared out of nowhere, he had already sold more than 18 million copies of the records he had made in the early '60s with his brother, Rusty. \"Louisiana Man\" had been a Top 10 country hit in 1961 and its follow-up, \"Diggy Liggy Lo\", had done almost as well. His performance in front of a national audience led to [[Warner Bros.
