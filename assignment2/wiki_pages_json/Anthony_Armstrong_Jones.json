A former [[Professional golfer|professional golf]]er, Jones recorded four albums for [[Chart Records]] in that timespan, in addition to charting six times in the Top 40 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country singles charts. His debut single was a No.&nbsp;22-peaking [[cover version|cover]] of \"[[Proud Mary]],\" originally by [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]], which served as the title track of his first album.  Its second single was \"[[New Orleans (Gary U.S. Bonds song)|New Orleans]],\" originally recorded by [[Gary U. S. Bonds]].\n\nJones' second album, ''Take a Letter Maria'', produced his biggest hit in its No.&nbsp;8 title track, a cover of the pop hit for [[R. B. Greaves]]. Later that year, he released ''Sugar in the Flowers'', which produced singles in \"Lead Me Not into Temptation\" and its title track. Finishing off his single releases that year was a rendition of [[Neil Diamond]]'s \"[[Sweet Caroline]],\" which Jones recorded on ''Take a Letter Maria''.\n\nJones later moved to [[Epic Records]], where he charted three singles in 1973, including a No.&nbsp;33 cover of [[Jim Croce]]'s \"[[Bad, Bad Leroy Brown]]\". He recorded for Homa Records in the 1970s but did not have any chart success, and charted for the last time in 1986 with the No.&nbsp;74 \"Those Eyes\" on the Air label. After retiring from the music business, Jones founded a club called Proud Mary in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]]. He died on June 16, 1996.\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Year\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Album\n! colspan=\"1\"| Chart positions\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n! width=\"50\"| [[Top Country Albums|US Country]]\n|-\n|1969\n|'''''Proud Mary'''''\n*<small>Released: 1969</small>\n*<small>Label: [[Chart Records]] No.&nbsp;1019</small>\n*<small>Format: [[LP album|LP]]</small>\n|align=\"center\"|44\n|-\n|rowspan=2|1970\n|'''''Take a Letter Maria'''''\n*<small>Released: 1969</small>\n*<small>Label: Chart Records No.&nbsp;1027</small>\n*<small>Format: LP</small>\n|align=\"center\"|42\n|-\n|'''''Sugar in the Flowers'''''\n*<small>Released: 1970</small>\n*<small>Label: Chart Records #CHS-1036</small>\n*<small>Format: LP</small>\n|align=\"center\"|—\n|-\n|1971\n|'''''Greatest Hits'''''\n*<small>Released: 1971</small>\n*<small>Label: Chart Records #CHS-1047</small>\n*<small>Format: LP</small>\n|align=\"center\"|—\n|}\n\n===Singles===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Year\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Single\n! colspan=\"2\"| Chart positions\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Album\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n! width=\"50\"| [[Hot Country Songs|US Country]]<ref name=\"whitburn\">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2008|publisher=Record Research, Inc.|pages=212|isbn=0-89820-177-2}}<!--|accessdate=2009-10-06--></ref>\n! width=\"50\"| CAN Country\n|-\n|rowspan=2|1969\n|\"[[Proud Mary]]\"\n|align=\"center\"|22\n|align=\"center\"|—\n|rowspan=2|''Proud Mary''\n|-\n|\"[[New Orleans (Gary U.S. Bonds song)|New Orleans]]\"\n|align=\"center\"|28\n|align=\"center\"|—\n|-\n|rowspan=5|1970\n|\"[[Take a Letter Maria]]\"\n|align=\"center\"|8\n|align=\"center\"|8\n|''Take a Letter Maria''\n|-\n|\"Lead Me Not Into Temptation\"\n|align=\"center\"|56\n|align=\"center\"|—\n|rowspan=3|''Sugar in the Flowers''\n|-\n|\"One for the Road\"<sup>A</sup>\n|align=\"center\"|—\n|align=\"center\"|32\n|-\n|\"Sugar in the Flowers\"\n|align=\"center\"|38\n|align=\"center\"|38\n|-\n|\"[[Sweet Caroline]]\"\n|align=\"center\"|40\n|align=\"center\"|35\n|''Take a Letter Maria''\n|-\n|rowspan=3|1973\n|\"I'm Right Where I Belong\"\n|align=\"center\"|70\n|align=\"center\"|—\n|rowspan=4|singles only\n|-\n|\"[[Bad, Bad Leroy Brown]]\"\n|align=\"center\"|33\n|align=\"center\"|83\n|-\n|\"I've Got Mine\"\n|align=\"center\"|69\n|align=\"center\"|—\n|-\n|1986\n|\"Those Eyes\"\n|align=\"center\"|74\n|align=\"center\"|—\n|}\n*<sup>A</sup>[[B-side]] to \"Lead Me Not into Temptation.\"\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20181021190250/http://www.chartrecords.net/a_a_jones_main.htm Anthony Armstrong Jones] biography at Chart Records.net\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jones, Anthony Armstrong}}\n[[Category:1949 births]]\n[[Category:1996 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Ada, Oklahoma]]\n[[Category:American country singer-songwriters]]\n[[Category:American male singer-songwriters]]\n[[Category:Country musicians from Oklahoma]]\n[[Category:20th-century American singer-songwriters]]\n[[Category:Singer-songwriters from Oklahoma]]\n[[Category:20th-century American male singers]]"
