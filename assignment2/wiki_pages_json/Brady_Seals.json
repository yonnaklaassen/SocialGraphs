He is the cousin of [[Jim Seals]] (of Seals & Crofts) and [[Dan Seals]], [[Johnny Duncan (country singer)|Johnny Duncan]], the nephew of [[Troy Seals]]. Seals made his debut in 1988 as co-lead vocalist and keyboardist in the sextet [[Little Texas (band)|Little Texas]], with whom he recorded until his departure in late 1994. Between then and 2002, he recorded as a solo singer, releasing three studio albums and charting in the Top 40 on the country charts with \"Another You, Another Me\". In 2002, Seals formed a quartet called [[Hot Apple Pie]], in which he has recorded one studio album and charted three singles. A fourth solo album, ''Play Time'', was released in 2009 via Star City.\n\n==Biography==\nSeals was raised in a musical home in the [[Cincinnati]], Ohio, suburb of [[Fairfield, Ohio|Fairfield]]. He began playing piano and writing songs at the age of nine, and was performing in a high-school band at the age of 16. After leaving home not long after, Seals returned to finish his education, but then left again. He ended up in Nashville and joined the group [[Little Texas (band)|Little Texas]] with friend and fellow musician Del Gray.\n\nSeals spent six years with Little Texas, playing keyboards and co-writing all of the band's major hits. By late 1994, shortly after the release of their third album, ''[[Kick a Little]]'', Seals had left the group and began a solo career. He signed to [[Reprise Records]] and released his debut album, ''The Truth'', in 1996. It produced three chart singles for him, including his only solo top 40 hit, \"Another You, Another Me\" at number 32.<ref name=\"whitburn\">{{cite book |last=Whitburn |first=Joel |title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2008 |publisher=Record Research, Inc |year=2008 |page=372 |isbn=0-89820-177-2}}</ref> Another album, the self-titled ''Brady Seals'', was issued in 1998 via Reprise Records' parent label, [[Warner Bros.
