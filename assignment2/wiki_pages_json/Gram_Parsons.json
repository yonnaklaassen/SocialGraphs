He recorded as a solo artist and with the [[International Submarine Band]], [[the Byrds]], and [[the Flying Burrito Brothers]], popularizing what he called \"Cosmic American Music\", a hybrid of [[country music|country]], [[rhythm and blues]], [[soul music|soul]], [[American folk music|folk]], and [[rock music|rock]].<ref>{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r1217687|pure_url=yes}}|title=Gram Parsons Archive, Vol. 1: Live at the Avalon Ballroom 1969 review|last=Leggett |first=Steve |work=Allmusic |access-date=21 March 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Schinder|first1=Scott|last2=Schwartz|first2=Andy|title=Icons of Rock: An Encyclopedia of the Legends Who Changed Music Forever|url=https://archive.org/details/iconsofrockencyc0000schi|url-access=registration|year=2008|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, Connecticut|isbn=978-0-313-33845-8|page=[https://archive.org/details/iconsofrockencyc0000schi/page/274 274]}}</ref>\n\nParsons was born in [[Winter Haven, Florida]], and developed an interest in country music while attending [[Harvard University]]. He founded the International Submarine Band in 1966, but the group disbanded prior to the 1968 release of its debut album, ''[[Safe at Home]]''. Parsons joined the Byrds in early 1968 and played a pivotal role in the making of the ''[[Sweetheart of the Rodeo]]'' album, a pioneering [[country rock]] album and a seminal [[progressive country]] recording.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kentucky.com/entertainment/music-news-reviews/article220248025.html |title= Marty Stuart thankful opening for Chris Stapleton, 'the man carrying the flag for country music'|last=Tunis|first=Walter |date=October 22, 2018|work=Lexington Herald-Leader |access-date=2023-07-23}}</ref> After leaving the group in late 1968, Parsons and fellow Byrd [[Chris Hillman]] formed The Flying Burrito Brothers in 1969; the band released its debut, ''[[The Gilded Palace of Sin]]'', the same year. The album was well received critically but failed commercially. After a sloppy cross-country tour, the band hastily recorded ''[[Burrito Deluxe]]''. Parsons was fired from the band before the album's release in early 1970.  Parsons spent the first half of 1971 with [[Keith Richards]] of the [[Rolling Stones]], living in his French villa [[Nellcôte]] during the recording sessions for ''[[Exile on Main Street]]'', though he contributed very little to the recording process itself.  After traveling around Britain with friends in late 1971, he was treated for [[heroin]] addiction and returned to the U.S., where he was introduced to [[Emmylou Harris]], who assisted him on vocals for his first solo record, ''[[GP (album)|GP]]'', released in 1973. Although the record received enthusiastic reviews, it failed to chart.  His health deteriorated due to several years of drug abuse, foreshadowing his death from a [[drug overdose|toxic combination]] of morphine and alcohol in 1973 at the age of 26.  A posthumous solo album, ''[[Grievous Angel]]'', peaked at number 195 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' chart.\n\nParsons's relatively short career was described by [[AllMusic]] as \"enormously influential\" for country and rock, \"blending the two genres to the point that they became indistinguishable from each other.\"<ref name=\"Allmusic Parsons\">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p5109|pure_url=yes}}|title=Gram Parsons Biography|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen|work=Allmusic|access-date=21 March 2010}}</ref> He has been credited with helping to found the [[country rock]] and [[alt-country]] genres.

Snively]], who held extensive properties in Winter Haven and in Waycross. Gram's father, Ingram Connor II was a famous [[World War II]] [[flying ace]], decorated with the [[Air Medal]], who was present at the 1941 [[attack on Pearl Harbor]].{{sfn|Meyer|2007|p=7}} Biographer David Meyer characterized these parents as loving; he wrote in ''Twenty Thousand Roads'' that they are \"remembered as affectionate parents and a loving couple\".{{sfn|Meyer|2007|p=27}}\n\nHowever, he also notes that \"unhappiness was eating away at the Connor family\": Avis suffered from depression, and both parents were [[alcoholic]]s.{{sfn|Meyer|2007|p=37}} Ingram Connor II died by suicide two days before Christmas in 1958, devastating the 12-year-old Gram and his younger sister, also named Avis.{{sfn|Meyer|2007|p=37-49}} Avis, Gram's mother, subsequently married Robert Parsons, who adopted Gram and his sister; they took his surname.\n\nGram Parsons briefly attended the prestigious [[Bolles School]] in [[Jacksonville, Florida]], before transferring to the public [[Winter Haven High School]]; after failing his junior year, he returned to Bolles. For a time, the family found a stability of sorts. They were torn apart in early 1965, when Robert became embroiled in an [[extramarital sex|extramarital affair]] and Avis' heavy drinking led to her death from [[cirrhosis]] on June 5, 1965, the day of Gram's graduation from Bolles.{{sfn|Meyer|2007|pp=139-143}}\n\nAs his family was disintegrating around him, Parsons developed strong musical interests, particularly after seeing [[Elvis Presley]] perform in concert on February 22, 1956, in Waycross.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elvispresleymusic.com.au/elvis_presley_1956.html |title=Elvis Presley 1956 : The King of Rock 'n' Roll |website=Elvispresleymusic.com.au |access-date=2012-06-07}}</ref> Five years later, barely in his teens, he played in [[rock and roll]] cover bands such as the Pacers and the Legends, headlining in clubs owned by his stepfather in the Winter Haven/Polk County area. By the age of 16, he graduated to [[folk music]], and in 1963 he teamed up with his first professional outfit, the Shilohs, in [[Greenville, South Carolina]].

Forays into New York City (where Parsons briefly lived with a female folk singer in a loft on Houston Street) included a performance at Florida's exhibition in the [[1964 New York World's Fair]] and regular appearances at the Café Rafio on [[Bleecker Street]] in [[Greenwich Village]] in the summer of 1964.

He did not become seriously interested in [[country music]] until his time at Harvard, where he heard [[Merle Haggard]] for the first time.\n\n=== The International Submarine Band (1966–1967) ===\n{{Main article|International Submarine Band}}\nIn 1966, he and other musicians from the Boston folk scene formed a group called the [[International Submarine Band]]. After briefly residing in the [[Kingsbridge, Bronx|Kingsbridge]] section of [[the Bronx]], they relocated to [[Los Angeles]] the following year. Following several lineup changes, the band signed to [[Lee Hazlewood]]'s [[LHI Records]], where they spent late 1967 recording ''[[Safe at Home]]''. The album contains one of Parsons' best-known songs, \"Luxury Liner,\" and an early version of \"Do You Know How It Feels,\" which he revised later in his career. ''Safe at Home'' would remain unreleased until mid-1968, by which time the International Submarine Band had broken up.\n\nThe International Submarine Band appeared in the [[Peter Fonda]] film [[The Trip (1967 film)|''The Trip'']] (1967) as a performing band in one of the clubs. Their song \"Lazy Days\" was offered for the film's soundtrack, however the soundtrack was later done by Mike Bloomfield's [[The Electric Flag|Electric Flag]]. In 1967, Peter Fonda had befriended Parsons through actor Brandon de Wilde.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Unterberger |first=Richie |date=May 24, 2020 |title=Peter Fonda, Rock's Easy Rider |url=http://www.richieunterberger.com/wordpress/peter-fonda-rocks-easy-rider/ |access-date=December 12, 2023 |website=Wordpress}}</ref> During this time, Fonda had recorded a version of the Parsons' song \"November Nights\" titled \"November Night\", dropping the 's'.

Their 1969 album ''[[The Gilded Palace of Sin]]'' marked the culmination of Parsons' post-1966 musical vision: a modernized variant of the [[Bakersfield sound]] that was popularized by [[Buck Owens]] amalgamated with strands of soul and [[psychedelic rock]]. The band appeared on the album cover wearing [[Nudie Cohn|Nudie]] suits emblazoned with all sorts of hippie accoutrements, including [[marijuana]], [[Tuinal]], and [[Seconal]]-inspired patches on Parsons' suit.<ref name=\"Grdn\">{{cite news |last1=Robinson |first1=John |title=Naked talent |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2004/feb/28/popandrock.gramparsons |access-date=24 August 2022 |work=The Guardian |date=28 February 2004}}</ref> Along with the Parsons-Hillman originals \"Christine's Tune\" and \"Sin City\" were versions of the [[soul music]] classics \"[[The Dark End of the Street]]\" and \"Do Right Woman\", the latter featuring David Crosby on high harmony. The album's original songs were the result of a very productive songwriting partnership between Parsons and Hillman, who were sharing a bachelor pad in the [[San Fernando Valley]] during this period. The atypically pronounced (for Parsons) gospel-soul influence on this album likely evolved from the ecumenical tastes of bassist Chris Ethridge (who co-wrote \"Hot Burrito No. 1 [I'm Your Toy]\" and \"Hot Burrito No. 2\" with Parsons) and frequent jamming with [[Delaney & Bonnie]] and Richards during the album's gestation.{{citation needed|date=August 2022}}\n\nOriginal drummer [[Eddie Hoh]] (best known for his work with [[The Monkees]] and [[Al Kooper]]) proved to be unable to perform adequate takes due to a substance abuse problem and was dismissed after two songs, leading the group to record the remainder of the album with a variety of session drummers, including former International Submarine Band drummer Jon Corneal (who briefly joined the group as an official member, appearing on a plurality of the tracks) and Popeye Phillips of [[Dr. Hook & the Medicine Show]]. Before commencing live performances, the group ultimately settled upon original Byrds drummer Michael Clarke. Technically different in comparison to his predecessors{{according to whom|date=November 2021}}, Clarke's striking physical appearance proved to be the primary criterion in this decision; an associate of the band would later recall that \"the Burritos had to be pretty\" and \"Corneal didn't fit\" from that standpoint.{{sfn|Meyer|2007|p=313}}\n\nWhile unsuccessful from a commercial standpoint, the album was measured by rock critic [[Robert Christgau]] as \"an ominous, obsessive, tongue-in-cheek country-rock synthesis, absorbing rural and urban, traditional and contemporary, at point of impact.\" Embarking on a cross-country tour via train, as Parsons suffered from periodic bouts of fear of flying, the group squandered most of their money in a perpetual poker game and received bewildered reactions in most cities. Parsons was frequently indulging in massive quantities of [[psilocybin]] and [[cocaine]], so his performances were erratic at best, while much of the band's repertoire consisted of vintage [[honky-tonk]] and soul standards with few originals. Perhaps the most successful appearance occurred in Philadelphia, where the group opened for the reconstituted Byrds. Midway through their set, Parsons joined the headline act and fronted his former group on renditions of \"Hickory Wind\" and \"You Don't Miss Your Water\". The other Burritos surfaced with the exception of Clarke, and the joint aggregation played several songs, including \"[[Long Black Veil]]\" and \"Goin' Back\".{{citation needed|date=August 2022}}\n\nThe Flying Burrito Brothers appeared at the [[Sky River Rock Festival]] near Sultan, Washington, at the end of August.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.humbead.com/skyriver/|title=The Sky River Rock Festival|date=December 13, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181213002048/http://www.humbead.com/skyriver/|archive-date=2018-12-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://concertposterauction.com/detail.asp?id=6642|title=Sky River Rock Festival 1969 AOR Concert/Event Poster - Listing # 6642|date=December 16, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181216031410/http://concertposterauction.com/detail.asp?id=6642|archive-date=2018-12-16}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://forums.stevehoffman.tv/threads/anybody-here-meet-gram-parsons.275850/|title=....Anybody here meet Gram Parsons?|website=Steve Hoffman Music Forums}}</ref>\n\nAfter returning to Los Angeles, the group recorded \"The Train Song\", written during an increasingly infrequent songwriting session on the train and produced by 1950s R&B legends [[Larry Williams]] and [[Johnny \"Guitar\" Watson]]. Despite a request from the Burritos that the remnants of their publicity budget be diverted to promotion of the single, it also flopped. During this period, Ethridge realized that he did not share Parsons' and Hillman's affinity for country music, precipitating his departure shortly thereafter. He was replaced by lead guitarist [[Bernie Leadon]], while Hillman reverted to bass.\n\nBy this time, Parsons's own [[recreational drug use|use of drugs]] had increased so much that new songs were rare and much of his time was diverted to partying with the Stones, who briefly relocated to America in the summer of 1969 to finish their forthcoming ''[[Let It Bleed]]'' album and prepare for an autumn cross-country tour, their first series of regular live engagements in over two years. As the Stones prepared to play the nation's largest basketball arenas and early stadium concerts, the Burritos played to dwindling nightclub audiences; on one occasion, Jagger had to beseech Parsons to fulfill an obligation to his group.

Playing a short set including \"Six Days on the Road\" and \"[[Bony Moronie]],\" Parsons left on one of the final helicopters and attempted to seduce [[Michelle Phillips]]. \"Six Days...\" was included in ''[[Gimme Shelter (1970 film)|Gimme Shelter]]'', a documentary of the event.\n\nWith mounting debt incurred, A&M hoped to recoup some of their losses by marketing the Burritos as a straight country group. To this end, manager Jim Dickson instigated a loose session where the band recorded several honky tonk staples from their live act, contemporary pop covers in a countrified vein (\"[[To Love Somebody (song)|To Love Somebody]]\", \"[[Lodi (Creedence Clearwater Revival song)|Lodi]]\", \"[[I Shall Be Released]]\", \"[[Honky Tonk Women]]\"), and Larry Williams' \"Bony Moronie.\" This was soon scrapped in favor of a second album of originals on an extremely reduced budget.\n\nFaced with a dearth of new material, most of the album was hastily written in the studio by Leadon, Hillman, and Parsons, with two ''Gilded Palace of Sin'' outtakes thrown into the mix. The resulting album, entitled ''[[Burrito Deluxe]]'', was released in April 1970. Although it is considered less inspired than its predecessor, it is notable for the Parsons-Hillman-Leadon song \"Older Guys\" and for its take on Jagger and Richards' \"Wild Horses\", the first recording released of this famous song. Parsons was inspired to cover the song after hearing an advance tape of the ''[[Sticky Fingers]]'' track sent to Kleinow, who was scheduled to overdub a pedal steel part; although Kleinow's part was not included on the released Rolling Stones version, it is available on bootlegs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ5KTXbXoJo| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211109/KJ5KTXbXoJo| archive-date=2021-11-09 | url-status=live|title=The Rolling Stones: Wild Horses (Alternate Sticky Fingers Version with Gram Parsons)|last=entarctica|date=9 May 2011|access-date=19 December 2017|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Ultimately—and to the chagrin of Hillman, who was not keen on the song amid the band's creative malaise—Jagger and Richards consented to the [[cover version]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tSy9OPq-XD0C&q=wild+horses+burrito+brothers&pg=PP112|title=Flying Burrito Brothers' The Gilded Palace of Sin|first=Bob|last=Proehl|date=15 December 2008|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing USA|access-date=19 December 2017|via=Google Books|isbn=9781441143495}}</ref>\n\nLike its predecessor, ''Burrito Deluxe'' underperformed commercially but also failed to carry the critical cachet of the debut. Disenchanted with the band, Parsons left the Burritos in mutual agreement with Hillman, who was long fatigued by his friend's unprofessionalism. Under Hillman's direction, the group recorded one more studio album before dissolving in the autumn of 1971.\n\nIn a recent interview with ''[[American Songwriter]]'' Chris Hillman explained that \"[t]he greatest legacy of the Flying Burrito Brothers and Gram is we were the alternative country band. We couldn't get on country radio and we couldn't get on rock radio! We were the outlaw country band for a brief period.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.americansongwriter.com/2012/05/pieces-of-the-sky-the-legacy-of-gram-parsons/|title=Pieces Of The Sky: The Legacy Of Gram Parsons|magazine=[[American Songwriter]]|access-date=4 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Solo career and touring with Emmylou Harris (1970–1973)===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=November 2019}}\nParsons signed a solo deal with A&M Records and moved in with producer [[Terry Melcher]] in early 1970.{{sfn|Meyer|2007|pp=337-342}} Melcher, who had worked with the Byrds and [[the Beach Boys]], was a member of the successful duo [[Bruce & Terry]], also known as [[The Rip Chords]]. The two shared a mutual penchant for cocaine and heroin, and as a result, the sessions were largely unproductive, with Parsons eventually losing interest in the project. \"Terry loved Gram and wanted to produce him ... But neither of them could get anything done,\" recalled writer and mutual friend [[Eve Babitz]].{{sfn|Meyer|2007|pp=340}} \"Long lost, the tapes from this session have gathered a legendary patina,\" writes David Meyer.{{sfn|Meyer|2007|pp=341}} The recording stalled, and the master tapes were checked out, but there is conflict as to whether \"Gram ... or Melcher took them\".{{sfn|Meyer|2007|pp=340-341}}\n\nHe then accompanied the Rolling Stones on their [[The Rolling Stones UK Tour 1971|1971 U.K. tour]] in the hope of being signed to the newly formed [[Rolling Stones Records]]; by this juncture, Parsons and Richards had mulled the possibility of recording a duo album. Moving into [[Villa Nellcôte]] with the guitarist during the sessions for ''[[Exile on Main St.|Exile on Main Street]]'' that commenced thereafter, Parsons remained in a consistently incapacitated state and frequently quarreled with his girlfriend, aspiring actress Gretchen Burrell. Eventually, Parsons was asked to leave by [[Anita Pallenberg]], Richards' longtime domestic partner. Decades later, Richards suggested in his memoir that Jagger may have been the impetus for Parsons' departure because Richards was spending so much time playing music with Parsons. Rumors have persisted that he appears somewhere on the legendary album, and while Richards concedes that it is very likely he is among the chorus of singers on \"Sweet Virginia\", this has never been substantiated. Parsons attempted to rekindle his relationship with the band on their [[The Rolling Stones American Tour 1972|1972 American tour]] to no avail.\n\nHe returned to the US for a one-off concert with the Burritos, and at Hillman's request went to hear [[Emmylou Harris]] sing in a small club in [[Washington, D.C.]] They befriended each other and, within a year, he asked her to join him in Los Angeles for another attempt to record his first solo album. It came as a surprise to many when Parsons was enthusiastically signed to [[Reprise Records]] by [[Mo Ostin]] in mid-1972. The ensuing ''[[GP (album)|GP]]'' (1973) featured several members of [[Elvis Presley]]'s [[TCB Band]], led by lead guitarist [[James Burton]]. It included six new songs from a creatively revitalized Parsons alongside several country covers, including [[Tompall Glaser]]'s \"[[Streets of Baltimore]]\" and [[George Jones]]' \"[[That's All It Took]]\".\n\nParsons, by now featuring Harris as his duet partner, toured across the United States as Gram Parsons and the Fallen Angels in February–March 1973. Unable to afford the services of the TCB Band for a month, the group featured the talents of Colorado-based rock guitarist [[Jock Bartley]] (soon to climb to fame with [[Firefall]]), veteran Nashville session musician [[Neil Flanz]] on pedal steel, eclectic bassist Kyle Tullis (best known for his work with [[Dolly Parton]] and [[Larry Coryell]]) and former [[Mountain (band)|Mountain]] drummer [[N.D. Smart]]. The touring party also included Gretchen Parsons—by this point extremely envious of Harris—and Harris' young daughter. Coordinating the spectacle as road manager was [[Phil Kaufman (producer)|Phil Kaufman]], who had served time with [[Charles Manson]] on [[Federal Correctional Institution, Terminal Island|Terminal Island]] in the mid-sixties and first met Parsons while working for the Stones in 1968. Kaufman ensured that the performer stayed away from substance abuse, limiting his [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] intake during shows and throwing out any drugs smuggled into hotel rooms. At first, the band was under-rehearsed and played poorly; however, they improved markedly with steady gigging and received rapturous responses at several leading countercultural venues, including [[Armadillo World Headquarters]] in [[Austin, Texas]], [[Max's Kansas City]] in New York City, and [[Liberty Hall (Houston, Texas)|Liberty Hall]] in [[Houston, Texas]] (where [[Neil Young]] and [[Linda Ronstadt]] sat in for a filmed performance). According to a number of sources, it was Harris who forced the band to practice and work up an actual set list. Nevertheless, the tour failed to galvanize sales of ''[[GP (album)|GP]]'', which never charted in the ''Billboard'' 200.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/search/artists/gram+parsons|title=Artist Search for \"gram parsons\"|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=19 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nFor his next and final album, 1974's posthumously released ''[[Grievous Angel]]'', he again used Harris and members of the TCB Band for the sessions. The record generally received more enthusiastic reviews than its predecessor, ''[[GP (album)|GP]]''. Although Parsons only contributed two new songs to the album (\"In My Hour of Darkness\" and \"Return of the Grievous Angel\"), he was reportedly enthusiastic with his new sound and seemed to have finally adopted a diligent mindset to his musical career, limiting his intake of alcohol and opiates during most of the sessions.\n\nBefore recording, Parsons and Harris played a preliminary four-show mini-tour as the headline act in a June 1973 Warner Brothers country rock package with the [[Kentucky Colonels (band)|New Kentucky Colonels]] and [[Country Gazette (band)|Country Gazette]]. A shared backing band included former Byrds lead guitarist and Kentucky Colonel [[Clarence White]], [[Pete Kleinow]], and [[Chris Ethridge]]. On July 15, 1973, White was killed by a drunk driver in [[Palmdale, California]], while loading equipment in his car for a concert with the New Kentucky Colonels.<ref>\"Car kills Topanga musician\", ''Long Beach (CA) Press-Telegram'', Monday, July 16, 1973, p. 13 (A Topanga musician loading instruments aboard his van was struck and killed Sunday...\")</ref> At White's funeral, Parsons and [[Bernie Leadon]] launched into an impromptu touching rendition of \"[[Farther Along (song)|Farther Along]]\"; that evening, Parsons reportedly informed Phil Kaufman of his final wish: to be cremated in Joshua Tree. Despite the almost insurmountable setback, Parsons, Harris, and the other musicians decided to continue with plans for a fall tour.\n\nIn the summer of 1973, Parsons' [[Topanga Canyon]] home burned to the ground, the result of a stray cigarette. Nearly all of his possessions were destroyed with the exception of a guitar and a prized [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]] automobile. The fire proved to be the last straw in the relationship between Burrell and Parsons, who moved into a spare room in Kaufman's house. While not recording, he frequently hung out and jammed with members of New Jersey–based country rockers [[Quacky Duck and His Barnyard Friends]] and the [[proto-punk]] [[Jonathan Richman]] & the Modern Lovers, who were represented by former Byrds manager Eddie Tickner.\n\n==Personal life==\nIn 1967, Nancy Ross gave birth to Gram's daughter [[Polly_Parsons_(producer)|Polly Parsons]].<ref name=\"latimes/2004-jul-08-wk-pop8\">{{cite news |last1=Cromelin |first1=Richard |title=The heir to a parent |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2004-jul-08-wk-pop8-story.html |access-date=11 September 2023 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=8 July 2004}}</ref>\n\nIn 1971, after leaving the Stones' camp, Parsons married Gretchen Burrell (Gretchen Lisl Berrill Parsons Carpenter),<ref name=\"californiabirthindex/4567413\">{{cite web |title=Gretchen Lisl Berrill born on May 15, 1952 in Los Angeles County, California. |url=https://www.californiabirthindex.org/birth/gretchen_lisl_berrill_born_1952_4567413 |website=CaliforniaBirthIndex.org |access-date=11 September 2023}}<!-- https://www.gettyimages.com/photos/gretchen-burrell --></ref><ref name=\"tcmdb/0%7C208758\">{{cite web |title=Gretchen Burrell |url=https://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/person/0%7C208758/Gretchen-Burrell |website=[[tcmdb]] |publisher=[[tcm.com]] |access-date=11 September 2023 |language=en}}</ref> at his stepfather's New Orleans estate. Allegedly, the relationship was far from stable, with Burrell cutting a needy and jealous figure while Parsons quashed her burgeoning film career. Many of the singer's closest associates and friends claim that Parsons was preparing to commence divorce proceedings at the time of his death; the couple had already separated by this point.\n\nParsons and Burrell enjoyed the most idyllic time of their relationship in the second half of 1971, visiting old cohorts like Ian Dunlop and [[Family (band)|Family]]/[[Blind Faith]]/[[Traffic (band)|Traffic]] bassist [[Ric Grech]] in England. With the help of Grech and one of Grech's friends who also dabbled in country music and is now known as [[Hank Wangford]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview with Hank Wangford |publisher=The Gram Parsons Project |url=http://www.gramparsonsproject.com/hank/index.htm |access-date=2011-11-06 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005060128/http://www.gramparsonsproject.com/hank/index.htm |archive-date=2011-10-05}}</ref> Parsons eventually stopped using heroin; a previous treatment suggested by [[William Burroughs]] proved unsuccessful.\n\nBefore formally breaking up with Burrell, Parsons already had a woman waiting in the wings. While recording, he saw a photo of a beautiful woman at a friend's home and was instantly smitten. The woman in the photo was Margaret Fisher, a high school sweetheart of the singer from his [[Waycross, Georgia]], days. Like Parsons, Fisher had drifted west and became established in the Bay Area rock scene. A meeting was arranged and the two instantly rekindled their relationship, with Fisher dividing her weeks between Los Angeles and San Francisco at Parsons' expense.\n\n==Death==\n{{Main|Death of Gram Parsons}}\nIn the late 1960s, Parsons became enamored of and began to vacation at [[Joshua Tree National Park]] (then a [[National Monument]]) in southeastern California, where he frequently used [[psychedelics]] and reportedly experienced several [[UFO sightings]]. After splitting from Burrell, Parsons often spent his weekends in the area with Margaret Fisher and Phil Kaufman, with whom he had been living. Scheduled to resume touring in October 1973, Parsons decided to go on another recuperative excursion on September 17. Accompanying him were Fisher, personal assistant Michael Martin, and Martin's girlfriend Dale McElroy. Kaufman later said that Parsons' attorney was preparing divorce papers to serve to Burrell while Parsons remained in Joshua Tree on September 20.{{sfn|Meyer|2007|p=416}}\n\nDuring the trip, Parsons often retreated to the desert, while the group visited bars in the nearby hamlet of [[Yucca Valley, California|Yucca Valley]] on both nights of their stay. Parsons consumed large amounts of alcohol and [[barbiturate]]s. On September 18, Martin drove back to Los Angeles to resupply the group with marijuana. That night, after challenging Fisher and McElroy to drink with him (Fisher disliked alcohol and McElroy was recovering from a bout of hepatitis), he said, \"I'll drink for the three of us,\" and proceeded to drink six double tequilas. They then returned to the Joshua Tree Inn, where Parsons purchased [[morphine]] from an unknown young woman. After being injected by her in room #1, he overdosed. Fisher gave Parsons an ice-cube [[suppository]], and later, a cold shower. Instead of moving Parsons around the room, she put him to bed in room #8 and went out to buy [[coffee]] in the hope of reviving him, leaving McElroy to stand guard. As his respirations became irregular and later ceased, McElroy attempted [[CPR|resuscitation]]. Her efforts failed and Fisher, watching from outside, was visibly alarmed. After further failed attempts, they decided to call an ambulance. Parsons was declared dead on arrival at Yucca Valley Hospital at 12:15&nbsp;a.m. on September 19, 1973, in Yucca Valley. The official cause of death was an overdose of morphine and alcohol.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PtpkCgAAQBAJ&q=%22discovering+that+parsons+had+overdosed%22&pg=PA66|title=The Encyclopedia of Dead Rock Stars: Heroin, Handguns, and Ham Sandwiches|first=Jeremy|last=Simmonds|page=66|edition=2nd|date=2012|publisher=Chicago Review Press|access-date=14 April 2020|via=Google Books|isbn=9781556527548}}</ref><ref name=\"dope\">[http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a5_014.html \"What's up with the strange end of country-rock pioneer Gram Parsons?\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080328235408/http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a5_014.html |date=March 28, 2008 }}, ''[[The Straight Dope]]''; accessed September 24, 2017.</ref>\n\nAccording to Fisher in the 2005 biography ''Grievous Angel: An Intimate Biography of Gram Parsons,'' the amount of morphine consumed by Parsons would be lethal to three regular users. [[Keith Richards]] stated in the 2004 [[documentary film]] ''Fallen Angel'' that Parsons understood the danger of combining opiates and alcohol and should have been more cautious. Upon Parsons' death, Fisher and McElroy were returned to Los Angeles by Kaufman, who dispersed the remnants of Parsons' drugs in the desert.\n\nBefore his death, Parsons said he wanted his body cremated at Joshua Tree and his ashes spread over Cap Rock, a prominent natural feature there. However, Parsons' stepfather Bob organized a private ceremony back in New Orleans and neglected to invite any of his friends from the music industry.<ref name=\"dope\"/> Two accounts state that Bob Parsons stood to inherit Gram's share of his grandfather's estate if he could prove that Gram was a resident of Louisiana, explaining his eagerness to have him buried there.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Strange Death of Gram Parsons: 1973 |publisher=ByrdWatcher: A Field Guide to the Byrds of Los Angeles |url=http://www.ebni.com/byrds/memgrp6.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990420141112/http://ebni.com/byrds/memgrp6.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=20 April 1999 |access-date=25 March 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gramparsonsproject.com/ |title=Gram Parsons Project, interview with Phil Kaufman |website=Gramparsonsproject.com |access-date=2012-06-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303043252/http://www.gramparsonsproject.com/ |archive-date=2012-03-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Gram Parsons Memorial.jpg|thumb|Parsons' makeshift memorial in [[Joshua Tree, California]]]]\nTo fulfill Parsons' funeral wishes, Kaufman and a friend stole his body from [[Los Angeles International Airport]] and in a borrowed hearse, they drove it to Joshua Tree. Upon reaching the Cap Rock section of the park, they attempted to cremate Parsons' body by pouring five gallons of gasoline into the open coffin and throwing a lit match inside; what resulted was an enormous fireball.\n\nThe two were arrested several days later. Since there was no law against stealing a dead body, they were only fined $750{{sfn|Fong-Torres|1998|p=4}} for stealing the coffin and were not prosecuted for leaving {{convert|35|lb}} of his charred remains in the desert. What remained of Parsons' body was eventually buried in Garden of Memories Cemetery in Metairie, Louisiana.\n\nThe site of Parsons' cremation is today known as The Cap Rock Parking Lot. A local myth brings Parsons fans out to a large [[Glossary of climbing terms#F|rock flake]] known to [[rock climbing|rock climbers]] as ''The Gram Parsons Memorial Hand Traverse''. This myth was popularized when someone added a slab that marked Parsons' cremation to the memorial rock. The slab has since been removed by the U.S. National Park Service, and relocated to the Joshua Tree Inn. There is no monument at Cap Rock noting Parsons' cremation at the site.<ref name=\"billboard\">[[Billboard Magazine]] article: \"[http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/79020/park-service-mulls-gram-parsons-memorial Park Service Mulls Gram Parsons Memorial].</ref> Joshua Tree park guides are given the option to tell the story of Parsons' cremation during tours, but there is no mention of the act in official maps or brochures.<ref name=\"billboard\" /> Fans regularly assemble simple rock structures and writings on the rock, which the Park Service periodically removes.<ref name=\"billboard\" />\n\n==Legacy==\n[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] of [[AllMusic]] describes Parsons as \"enormously influential\" for both country and rock, \"blending the two genres to the point that they became indistinguishable from each other. ...

The show featured tunes written by Gram Parsons and [[Gene Clark]] as well as influential songs and musical styles from other artists that were part of that era. Performers were also encouraged to showcase their own material. The underlying theme of the event is to inspire the performers to take these musical styles to the next level of the creative process. Past concerts have featured such notable artists as [[Sneaky Pete Kleinow]], [[Chris Ethridge]], [[Spooner Oldham]], [[John Molo]], Jack Royerton, [[Gib Guilbeau]], [[Counting Crows]], Bob Warford, [[Rosie Flores]], [[David Lowery (musician)|David Lowery]], [[Barry and Holly Tashian]], George Tomsco, [[Jann Browne]], [[Lucinda Williams]], Polly Parsons, The \"Road Mangler\" Phil Kaufman, [[Ben Fong-Torres]], [[Victoria Williams]], [[Mark Olson (musician)|Mark Olson]], and [[Sid Griffin]], as well as a variety of many other bands that had played over the two or three day event. In addition, the Gram Parsons Tribute, in Waycross, Georgia, is a music festival remembering Parsons in the town in which he grew up. Additional tributes spring up every year, the latest being the Southern California \"Gram On!\" celebration by The Rickenbastards in July, 2013, celebrating the life and legacy of a simple country boy with a dream, Gram Parsons.\n\nIn February 2008, Gram's protégée, [[Emmylou Harris]], was inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]].
