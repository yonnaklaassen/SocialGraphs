Active since 1990, he has recorded eight studio albums, and has charted more than twenty singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now [[Hot Country Songs]]) charts. His highest-charting hits are \"[[What Kind of Fool Do You Think I Am]]\" (1992), \"[[Tender Moment]]\" (1993), and \"[[A Little Bit of You (Lee Roy Parnell song)|A Little Bit of You]]\" (1995), all of which peaked at No.&nbsp;2. Four more of his singles have charted in the Top Ten as well. Parnell made a shift in the early 2000s back to the bluesier sounds of his early works, releasing two blues albums on [[Vanguard Records]] and [[Universal South]]. Besides his own work, Parnell has played [[slide guitar]] and [[National String Instrument Corporation|National guitar]] on several other country and blues recordings.\n\n==Early years==\nParnell was born in [[Abilene, Texas]], but raised in [[Stephenville, Texas]].<ref name=\"encyclopedia\">{{cite book|last1=Stambler|first1=Irwin|last2=Landon|first2=Grelun|title=Country Music: The Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d18K8QWcEo8C&q=%22lee+roy+parnell%22&pg=PA359|date=July 14, 2000|publisher=Macmillan|pages=359–360|isbn=9780312264871}}</ref> His father had performed with [[Bob Wills]], and Parnell gave his first performance at age six on Wills' radio show.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> Parnell played guitar and drums in various bands during his teenage years. He joined [[Kinky Friedman]]'s [[Texas Jewboys]] in his late teens and moved to Austin in 1974 to join the city's budding music scene. <ref name=\"allmusic\"/> He moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], in 1987, and he signed with the [[Arista Nashville]] recording company two years later.<ref name=\"encyclopedia\"/>\n\n==Career==\n===''Lee Roy Parnell''===\nParnell released his [[Lee Roy Parnell (album)|self-titled debut album]] for [[Arista Records]] in 1990.<ref name=\"Rusty Russell 2009\">Rusty Russell.  \"Lee Roy Parnell: A Nashville hitmaker breaks out. \" Guitar Player  December 1, 2001: General Interest Module, ProQuest. Web.  July 14, 2009.</ref> This album produced three chart singles in \"Crocodile Tears\", \"Oughta Be a Law\" and \"Family Tree\", none of which charted in the Top 40 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country charts. A video for \"Mexican Money\" was created and released, but the song was not released to radio.\n\n===''Love Without Mercy''===\n''[[Love Without Mercy]]'' was Parnell's breakthrough album, released in 1992. Although its lead-off single \"The Rock\" fell short of Top 40, the next three singles all reached Top Ten:<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> \"[[What Kind of Fool Do You Think I Am]]\" at No.&nbsp;2, the title track at No.&nbsp;8, and finally \"Tender Moment\" also at No.&nbsp;2. These three were also Top Ten hits on the ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' charts in Canada.\n\n===''On the Road''===\n1993's ''[[On the Road (Lee Roy Parnell album)|On the Road]]'', Parnell's third album for the Arista label, also produced two top-10 hits: the [[On the Road (Lee Roy Parnell song)|title track]] and \"I'm Holding My Own\", at No.&nbsp;6 and No.&nbsp;3 respectively. The album also contained a No.&nbsp;17-peaking rendition of the [[Hank Williams]] song \"Take These Chains from My Heart\", which Parnell recorded as a duet with [[Ronnie Dunn]] of [[Brooks & Dunn]], although Dunn was not credited on the chart. The final single from ''On the Road'', \"The Power of Love\", peaked at No.&nbsp;51.\n\n===''We All Get Lucky Sometimes''===\nParnell's fourth album, 1995's ''[[We All Get Lucky Sometimes]]'', was also his first for Career Records, then a newly formed subsidiary of [[Arista Nashville]]. This album's lead-off single \"A Little Bit of You\" was the third single of his career to reach No.&nbsp;2. Following it were the No.&nbsp;12 \"When a Woman Loves a Man\" (featuring background vocals by [[Trisha Yearwood]]), the No.&nbsp;3 \"Heart's Desire\" and another No.&nbsp;12 in \"Giving Water to a Drowning Man\". The album's title track, which was its fifth single, peaked at No.&nbsp;46.\n\n===''Every Night's a Saturday Night'' and ''Hits and Highways Ahead''===\n''[[Every Night's a Saturday Night]]'' was Parnell's final release for Career Records. This was his first album since his debut release that did not produce a Top Ten hit, and only three singles were released from it: \"Lucky Me, Lucky You\" at No.&nbsp;35, \"You Can't Get There From Here\" at No.&nbsp;39 (his final Top 40 hit), and \"All That Matters Anymore\" at No.&nbsp;50. After Career Records was merged back into Arista Nashville, Parnell released his final album for the Arista label, 1999's ''[[Hits and Highways Ahead]]''. This album's only single, \"She Won't Be Lonely Long\", peaked at No.&nbsp;57, and by the year's end, Parnell exited Arista's roster.\n\n===''Tell the Truth'', ''Back to the Well'' and ''Midnight Believer''===\nIn 2000 Parnell signed to [[Vanguard Records]]<ref name=\"Rusty Russell 2009\"/> and released the album ''Tell the Truth''. This album's only single, \"South by Southwest\", failed to chart, and he soon left the label as well. Parnell's next album, ''Back to the Well'', came in 2006 on [[Universal South Records]], although it also produced only one non-charting single in \"Daddies and Daughters.\"\n\n==External contributions==\nBesides playing [[slide guitar]] and [[National guitar]] on his albums and co-writing several of his own songs, Parnell has co-written two Top 40 country hits for other artists: \"Too Much\" by [[Pirates of the Mississippi]] and \"[[That's My Story (song)|That's My Story]]\" by [[Collin Raye]], from 1992 and 1993 respectively. In 1994, he and [[Steve Wariner]] collaborated with [[Diamond Rio]] on a cover of [[Merle Haggard]]'s \"[[Workin' Man's Blues]]\", credited to Jed Zeppelin and recorded for a tribute album ''[[Mama's Hungry Eyes: A Tribute to Merle Haggard]]''. This rendition peaked at No.&nbsp;48 on the country charts. He played slide guitar on [[Mary Chapin Carpenter]]'s late-1994 Number One hit \"[[Shut Up and Kiss Me (Mary Chapin Carpenter song)|Shut Up and Kiss Me]]\", and appeared in the song's music video. Parnell added slide guitar to [[Delbert McClinton]]'s \"Sending Me Angels\" in 1997, and in late 2004, he was credited with playing slide guitar on [[David Lee Murphy]]'s No.&nbsp;46-peaking single \"Inspiration\", from the album ''[[Tryin' to Get There]]''.\n\n==Discography==\n{{main|Lee Roy Parnell discography}}\n\n;Studio albums\n*''[[Lee Roy Parnell (album)|Lee Roy Parnell]]'' (1990)\n*''[[Love Without Mercy]]'' (1992)\n*''[[On the Road (Lee Roy Parnell album)|On the Road]]'' (1993)\n*''[[We All Get Lucky Sometimes]]'' (1995)\n*''[[Every Night's a Saturday Night]]'' (1997)\n*''Tell the Truth'' (2001)\n*''Back to the Well'' (2006)\n*''Midnight Believer'' (2017)\n\n;Compilation albums\n*''[[Hits and Highways Ahead]]'' (1999)\n\n==Notes==\n{{refbegin}}\n\n*A{{anchor|endnote_A}}'''[[#ref_A|^]]''' Jed Zeppelin was an all-star group featuring [[Diamond Rio]], Lee Roy Parnell, and [[Steve Wariner]].\n\n{{refend}}\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year\n!Organization\n!Award\n!Nominee/Work\n!Result\n|-\n|1994\n|rowspan=2| [[Country Music Association Awards]]\n|[[Country Music Association Award for New Artist of the Year|Horizon Award]]\n|Lee Roy Parnell\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|1995\n|Vocal Event of the Year\n|\"[[Workin' Man Blues]]\" <small>with [[Diamond Rio]] and [[Steve Wariner]]</small>\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|1996\n|[[Grammy Awards]]\n|[[Grammy Award for Best Country Instrumental Performance|Best Country Instrumental Performance]]\n|\"Cat Walk\" <small>with [[Flaco Jimenez]]</small>\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|1997\n|Country Music Association Awards\n|Vocal Event of the Year\n|\"John the Revelator: Peace in the Valley\" <small>with [[The Fairfield Four]]</small>\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|1998\n|Grammy Awards\n|Best Country Instrumental Performance\n|\"Mama, Screw Your Wig On Tight\"\n|{{nom}}\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n<!-- *Cronin, Peter. \"Parnell slips into the mainstream.\" ''Billboard'' 105.46 (Nov 13, 1993): 35.\n*Flippo, Chet. \"Parnell Revisits Hits and Looks `Ahead'; Remembering Music Pioneer Anita Carter.\" ''Billboard'' 111.33 (Aug 14, 1999): 28. \n*Huey, Steve.
