In early 1978, Williamson released his first compilation album under the ''Country Greats'' series. This was followed later in the year by his third album, ''Road to Town'', with contributions by other musicians including [[Tommy Emmanuel]] on guitar. Also that year Williamson formed a country music band, Crow, which performed on the pub and club circuit across Australia. In 1980 Crow were renamed as Sydney Radio, to play rock music with a reggae influence. The members used face paint, with Williamson disguised as the clown, Ludwig Leichhardt. Williamson penned rock and reggae numbers for the band some of which were recorded but never released. Since 1970 Williamson has had a friendship with radio presenter, [[John Laws]], who calls Williamson his 'little brother'. In 1977, Williamson recorded and released a single, \"It's a Grab It While It's Goin' Kind of Life\", which is a musical tribute to Laws. Up until Laws' first retirement on 25 June 2007, Williamson wrote and performed a series of [[jingle]]s for Laws' morning show on [[2UE]], and his final jingle was \"Hey good on ya Lawsie, you pulled the plug at last\". Laws made a successful comeback to radio broadcasting in February 2011, this time at [[2SM]], part of the Super Radio Network, and Williamson's jingles for his programme resumed.\n\n===1980s===\nIn early 1981 John Williamson's rock group, Sydney Radio, disbanded and he began playing solo in pubs, which attracted more new fans. He recorded a tribute song for [[ANZAC]]s, \"Diggers of the ANZAC (This Is Gallipoli)\", which was well received and issued as a single. Williamson met [[Pixie Jenkins]], a fiddle player, and the two toured together for several years. In April 1981 Williamson issued a single, \"The Breaker\", featuring narrated vocals by [[Bud Tingwell|Charles 'Bud' Tingwell]], which was inspired by the movie, ''[[Breaker Morant (film)|Breaker Morant]]'' (1980) (which had Tingwell as a supporting actor).<ref name=\"Breaker\">{{cite web | url = http://www.tvmem.com/OZST/ffilms/B-FFILM/BREAKERM.htm | title = ''Breaker Morant'' | publisher = Australian Soundtracks | editor = Dennis W.

Later that year, he issued ''Fair Dinkum J.W.'', featuring traditional Australian ballads, \"With My Swag upon My Shoulder\", \"Botany Bay\" and \"Brisbane Ladies\"; as well as originals, \"Country Football\", \"Kill the Night\", \"Wrinkles\" and \"(You've Gotta Be) Fair Dinkum\", a duet with Karen Johns.\n\nIn 1983 Williamson released his first solo live album, ''[[Singing in the Suburbs]]'' and another live album, ''[[The Smell of Gum Leaves]]'', in September 1984. It featured another comic track, \"I'm Fair Dinkum\". Williamson then launched his merchandise business, The Fair Dinkum Road Company, in Sydney. The album included his cover version of [[Spectrum (band)|Spectrum]]'s 1971 single, \"[[I'll Be Gone (Spectrum song)|I'll Be Gone]]\", which he played using only guitar and harmonica. At the start of 1985 he founded an independent record label, Gumleaf Recordings.

The next two tracks, \"Frangipani Bay\" and \"Cape York Peninsula\", were written during a road trip to Australia's most northern point. The lyrics in \"The Devil's Boots\" relate to the bushranger, [[Ned Kelly]]. \"Buried in Her Bedclothes\" was written after Williamson and Mary-Kay, his spouse of the time, met an elderly woman on an [[Indian Pacific]] rail trip. Her husband had died six months earlier and she had refused to get out of bed for three months. Her family suggested the train trip as a remedy – she shared her memories with the Williamsons and said that the train 'had done the job'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://members.madasafish.com/~d_hodgkinson/TBsongs.htm|title=John Williamson - the Aussie Ballader |publisher=Mad as a Fish|access-date=2 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nWilliamson referred to 2003 as his 'most True Blue year ever'.

Also on ''[[Chandelier of Stars]]'' is \"A Country Balladeer\" which is a duet with [[Chad Morgan]], and \"Flower on the Water\" is a tribute to the victims of the Bali bombings. The first four lines are inspired by words on a photo of a deceased victim: \"To hear your voice, to see you smile / To sit and talk to you awhile / To be together the same old way / That would be our greatest wish today\". Williamson found the author and started a friendship.\n\nThe following November, Williamson released the new song \"We Love This Country\" on a compilation of the same name with his favourite holiday songs to promote Australian tourism with [[travel trailer|caravans]] – it became a jingle for [[Jayco]] commercials. He promoted the aforementioned projects of 2005 together with [[Pixie Jenkins]] and [[Warren H Williams]] as part of their True Blue Reunion Tour. In August 2006, ''[[The Platinum Collection (John Williamson album)|The Platinum Collection]]'', a three-disc set of Williamson's hits from 1970''–''2005 was released. In September, Williamson was devastated after hearing of the death of fellow wildlife conservationist and friend, [[Steve Irwin]]. In reaction to the news, he wrote a tribute tune, \"Wildlife Warriors: It's Time\". He was evidently emotional while performing both \"[[Give Me a Home Among the Gumtrees|Home Among the Gum Trees]]\" and \"True Blue\" at Irwin's memorial service inside the arena of his [[Australia Zoo]] Crocoseum. The service was filmed live-to-air and later released on DVD. ''[[Wildlife Warriors (album)|Wildlife Warriors]]'' was additionally released in November 2006 on a compilation album of the same name, along with twelve of Williamson's favourite conservation awareness tracks and his two live performances from Irwin's memorial.\n\nAt the beginning of 2008 Williamson decided to put together a musical. Based on his music and lyrics, the book by [[Simon Heath]] and directed by [[Bernie Zelvis]], Williamson named it ''[[Quambatook (musical)|Quambatook – The Musical]]''. On 7 February 2008, the musical was premiered at the EVAN Theater in [[Penrith, New South Wales|Penrith]] to positive reviews, making it a major highlight in the history of Australian musical theatre.\n\nThe album ''[[Hillbilly Road]]'' was released in August 2008. The lyrics for the album were inspired by his home in [[Springbrook, Queensland|Springbrook]]. Subsequent singles that followed were \"Cydi\", \"Drink a Little Love\", \"Australia Is Another Word for Free\" as a trio with Williams and [[Amos Morris]], and \"Better Than a Picture\". \"The Joy Is in the Journey\" was a special bonus addition to finish the album, previously appearing on the [[Quambatook (musical)#Concept album|Quambatook Musical soundtrack]]. The ''[[Hillbilly Road]]'' album was promoted everywhere around Australia until early the next year when Williams decided to move on and pursue other musical projects, leaving Williamson to perform the rest of the tour solo. At the Country Music Awards of Australia for 2009 he won 'Bush Ballad of the Year' for \"Australia Is Another Word for Free\", performed by Williamson, Williams and Morris.<ref name=\"CMAA2009\">{{cite web | url = http://www.country.com.au/winners-archive/66-2009 | title = 2009 | date = 2 July 2010 | publisher = Country Music Association of Australia (CMAA) | access-date = 25 October 2012 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110706103257/http://www.country.com.au/winners-archive/66-2009 | archive-date = 6 July 2011 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nBy late 2009 Williamson got together with fellow country star [[Adam Harvey]] and recorded their cover to Roger Miller's \"[[King of the Road (song)|King of the Road]]\", issued both as a single and on Harvey's duets album ''Both Sides Now''. Williamson then made his [[Carols By Candlelight]] debut at the [[Sidney Myer Music Bowl]].\n\n===2010s===\nOn 26 January ([[Australia Day]]) 2010 Williamson released a new Australian anthem called \"Island of Oceans\" as a duet with [[Shannon Noll]]. Williamson released a new double-CD compilation album ''[[Absolute Greatest: 40 Years True Blue]]'' commemorating this milestone. At a press conference for the album in Tamworth on 21 January hosted by the then [[Governor-General]] [[Quentin Bryce]], in his acceptance speech, John expressed his gratitude for the longevity of his career up to that point, in the process thanking his fans, friends and family, including his first wife, Mary-Kay.\n\nOn 28 January 2011 Williamson released a recording of a concert with the [[Sydney Symphony Orchestra]] at the [[Sydney Opera House]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.musicshop.com.au/john-williamson-john-williamson-in-symphony-cd-dvd.html |title=John Williamson John Williamson in Symphony CD/DVD |access-date=2 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120903155834/http://www.musicshop.com.au/john-williamson-john-williamson-in-symphony-cd-dvd.html |archive-date=3 September 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.sanity.com.au/products/2195165/John_Williamson_In_Symphony_SIGNED_COPY | title=John Williamson in Symphony }}</ref> At the Australian Country Music Awards in Tamworth that same month John presented [[Jimmy Little]] with the Lifetime Achievement\nAward.\n\nIn January 2012, Williamson released ''[[The Big Red]]''.
