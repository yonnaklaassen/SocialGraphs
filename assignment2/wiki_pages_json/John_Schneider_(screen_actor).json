His other brother (also called John) died of lung failure age three, three years before John's birth. John's life as an entertainer began at the age of eight, when he put on magic shows for his peers and their families. This once got him into trouble, when he had himself chained up and tossed into a swimming pool with the intention of re-creating [[Harry Houdini]]'s legendary escape act. When he was 14, he and his mother moved to [[Atlanta]], Georgia, where his love for performing continued.

They returned to their roles in February 1983 only after their claims were satisfied. The show was canceled in 1985, after seven seasons. Schneider directed the series finale, titled \"Opening Night at the Boar's Nest,\" airing originally on CBS, February 8, 1985.\n\n[[File:John Schneider, Tom Welling & Brian Peterson.jpg|right|thumb|Schneider (left) with Smallville co-star Tom Welling and producer Brian Peterson]]\n\nIn 2001, he portrayed [[Jonathan \"Pa\" Kent|Jonathan Kent]], the adoptive father of [[Clark Kent]] on ''[[Smallville]]'', starring in 100 episodes.
