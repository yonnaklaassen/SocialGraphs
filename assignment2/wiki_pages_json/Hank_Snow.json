He was the fifth of six children, of whom the two eldest died in infancy. His parents were married on November 10, 1909, in Liverpool, Nova Scotia.<ref name=\"Hatt-1983\" /> After divorcing his father, Hank's mother married Charles Tanner in 1930.<ref name=\"TannerObit-1953\" /> In his autobiography, Snow tells how his parents struggled to feed their four remaining children during hard financial times. George Snow worked for low pay as a foreman in [[sawmill]]s, often far from home, while Marie helped support the family by washing clothes and scrubbing floors in better-off homes. Both parents showed musical talent. Although Snow says his father loved to sing \"in an amateurish way\", he describes his mother as \"an accomplished singer\" who played piano during [[silent film]]s at the local theatre and sometimes performed in [[minstrel show]]s. She also enjoyed playing her own [[pump organ]], but refused several offers to join travelling shows because of her dedication to the family.<ref name=\"HankSnow\">Hank Snow with Jack Ownbey and Bob Burris. (1994) ''The Hank Snow Story: Hank Snow, the Singing Ranger''. Urbana, Illinois: University of Illinois Press.</ref>\n\nSnow's parents legally separated when he was eight, and the local [[Overseer of the Poor]] decided the children should be taken from their mother because of her inability to support them financially. One sister moved in with an aunt, while the other two were sent to separate foster homes. Snow himself went to live with his paternal grandmother, who ordered him never to mention his mother's name and subjected him to severe beatings, as well as psychological abuse.{{citation needed|date=August 2023}} Gradually, Snow began to sneak away to visit his mother in nearby [[Liverpool, Nova Scotia|Liverpool]] and eventually, after his grandmother failed in her attempt to get him sent to [[reform school]], he was allowed to rejoin his mother.<ref name=\"HankSnow\" />\n\n===Musical beginnings===\nAfter his mother's remarriage to local fisherman Charles Tanner, she ordered a Hawaiian [[steel guitar]] advertised in a magazine along with free lessons and several 78 rpm [[gramophone record]]s. At first, she ordered her son not to touch the guitar because it was one of her prized possessions, but later, when she finally allowed him to play, she marveled at his play. He was soon invited to play for his neighbors and elsewhere.<ref name=\"HankSnow\" />\n\n===Life at sea===\n[[File:The Famous Bluenose.jpg| thumb | Photo of the ''[[Bluenose]]''. Snow painted the schooner on cardboard winning 1st prize at the Lunenburg Fisheries Exhibition.]]\n\nIn 1926, Snow found work by joining a fishing [[schooner]] where he served as a \"flunky\" or cabin boy.<ref>The Merriam-Webster online dictionary defines ''flunky'', in this sense, as \"one performing menial or miscellaneous duties.\" Snow's duties included forking cod from the deck into a bin where a \"throater\" would grab the fish, slit its throat and belly before passing it on to another crew member who would remove its head.</ref><ref name=\"AllMusic\"/> The job did not pay any wages. Snow, however, was allowed to cut out cod tongues and sell them later along with any fish he caught from the deck. After one trip, he sold his tongues and fish for around $58. Feeling rich, he ordered a guitar and chord book for $5.95 from the [[Eaton's|T. Eaton]] mail-order catalogue. In 1927 or 1928, Snow remembers hearing radio broadcasts while at sea. The one-hour broadcasts featured recordings by such country artists as [[Vernon Dalhart]] and [[Carson Robison]]. \"I still remember Dalhart singing '[[The Prisoner's Song]],' and 'The [[Wreck of the Old 97]],'\" Snow recalls. \"These songs gave me a great lift.\" He adds that he tried to sing the songs exactly as the artists had, entertaining his fellow crew members by singing and dancing while accompanying himself on a [[mouth organ]].<ref name=\"HankSnow\" />\n\nSnow's fishing trips went well until August 1930, when the schooner he was sailing on got caught in ferocious winds that blew it uncontrollably toward [[Sable Island]], known as the \"[[Graveyard of the Atlantic]]\" because the crews of ships wrecked there rarely survived. Snow writes that when they were about 14 miles from the island, \"the Good Lord reached out his hand and changed the wind. Saved by the grace of God!\" A day later, Snow learned that six other vessels had been lost in the gale and that 132 men had drowned. Once ashore in [[Canso, Nova Scotia|Canso]], Snow vowed he would never return to the open sea again. \"I was finished,\" he wrote. \"No more fishing trips for me.\"<ref name=\"HankSnow\" />\n\n===Life after sailing===\n\nSnow returned to live with his mother and stepfather, again without holding down steady work. Instead, he attempted to get by just peddling fish door-to-door or landing occasional jobs that included transporting passengers and their luggage by horse-drawn buggy to and from the train station in [[Lunenburg, Nova Scotia|Lunenburg]]; unloading salt and coal ships; raking [[scallops]] and hauling loads of dried [[cod]] into a warehouse for processing and shipping. One winter, after being reunited with his father, he cut pulpwood and firewood on his father's farm in the backwoods at [[Pleasantville, Nova Scotia|Pleasantville]].<ref name=\"HankSnow\" />\n\nOn September 2, 1935, he married Minnie Blanche Aalders, a young [[Fairview, Nova Scotia|Halifax]] woman, born in [[Kentville, Nova Scotia]],<ref>NS Scotia vital statistics, [https://www.novascotiagenealogy.com/ItemView.aspx?ImageFile=77-970&Event=marriage&ID=221136 marriage record] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230303200943/https://archives.novascotia.ca/vital-statistics/ItemView/?ImageFile=77-970&Event=marriage&ID=221136 |date=2023-03-03 }}</ref> who worked in a local chocolate factory. She soon became pregnant and gave birth to their only child, Jimmie Rodgers Snow.<ref name=\"HankSnow\" />\n\n==Career==\n===Early music career===\nAt one point, Snow spotted a picture of a guitar for $12.95 in Eaton's catalogue. He figured he could sell his old guitar for five dollars, but since he still wasn't working, he wondered how he would raise the additional $7.95. The answer came when a storeowner in the village of [[Blue Rocks, Nova Scotia|Blue Rocks]] hired him to paint yellow pinstripes on the wooden spokes of his brand new car. He offered to pay Snow two dollars per wheel. After the new guitar arrived, Snow experimented by playing runs and [[chord progression]]s in the style of Jimmie Rodgers. He also sang and played in an old fishhouse where local men stored their gear. Soon, Snow was invited to perform in a [[minstrel show]] in [[Bridgewater, Nova Scotia|Bridgewater]] to help raise money for charity. \"Someone blackened my face with black polish and put white rings around my eyes and lips,\" Snow recalls. When his turn came in the show, he played a song called \"I Went to See My Gal Last Night.\" \"My debut was a big success,\" Snow wrote. \"I even got a standing ovation.\"<ref name=\"HankSnow\" />\n\nIn March 1933, Snow wrote to Halifax radio station [[CHNS-FM|CHNS]], asking for an audition. The rejection letter he received only made him more determined. Later that year, he visited the station, was given an audition and hired to do a Saturday evening show that was advertised as ''Clarence Snow and his Guitar''. After a few months, he adopted the name \"The Cowboy Blue Yodeler\" in homage to his idol Jimmie Rodgers, known as \"America's Blue Yodeler.\" Since Snow's Saturday show had no sponsor, he was not paid for his performances, but he did manage to earn money playing halls and clubs in towns where people had heard him on the radio. He also played in Halifax theatres before the movies started and performed, for $10 a week, on a CHNS musical show sponsored by a company that manufactured a popular laxative. At the urging of the station's chief engineer and announcer, he adopted the name Hank because it went well with cowboy songs and once again, influenced by Jimmie Rodgers, he became \"Hank, The Yodeling Ranger.\" Snow also appeared occasionally on the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]'s regional network.<ref name=\"HankSnow\" />\n\n===Canadian years===\nSnow's audition with the Canadian division of [[RCA Victor]] in [[Montreal, Quebec]], on October 29, 1936, led to a recording contract and the release of his first record, with \"The Prisoned Cowboy\" coupled with \"Lonesome Blue Yodel.\"<ref name=\"HankSnow\" /> Snow spent his entire career with [[RCA Records|RCA]] Victor, recording for the label until 1981. A weekly CBC radio show brought him national recognition and, he began touring Canada until the late 1940s, when American country music stations began playing his records.\n\n===Nashville===\nSnow moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]] in 1949, and \"Hank Snow, the Singing Ranger,\" made his first records in the United States for RCA Victor in 1949. His first US release, \"[[Hank Snow discography|Marriage Vow]],\" climbed to number ten on the country charts in the fall of 1949; However, it was not until he was invited to play at the [[Grand Ole Opry]] in 1950 that he gained serious attention in the United States. His second release in early 1950, \"I'm Moving On,\" was the first of seven number-one hits on the country charts. \"I'm Moving On\" stayed at the top for 21 weeks, setting the all-time record for most weeks at number one.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Streaming Statistics of Hank Snow |url=https://spacemedia.uk/stats/artist/3fq6r0bSIm4McymHKNMk4S |access-date=2024-07-30 |website=spacemedia.uk}}</ref>\n\nThat same year \"The Golden Rocket\" and \"[[The Rhumba Boogie]]\" both hit number one, with the latter remaining there for eight weeks.<ref>{{Citation | title = Boogie Bobs records | url = http://www.boogiebobsrecords.com/component/page,shop.cart/func,cartAdd/product_id,38949/option,com_virtuemart/Itemid,1/vmcchk,1/ | access-date = 14 December 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110708082651/http://www.boogiebobsrecords.com/component/page,shop.cart/func,cartAdd/product_id,38949/option,com_virtuemart/Itemid,1/vmcchk,1/ | archive-date = 2011-07-08 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\nAlong with these hits, his other \"signature song\" was \"[[I've Been Everywhere]],\" in which he portrayed himself as a [[hitchhiker]] bragging about all the towns he had been through. This song was originally written and performed in Australia by [[Geoff Mack]], and its re-write incorporated North American place names. Rattling off a well-rhymed series of city names at an [[auctioneer]]'s pace has long made the song a challenge for any singer.\n\nWhile performing in [[Renfro Valley]], Snow worked with a young [[Hank Williams]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Jim |date=2012-10-17 |title=DUQUESNE PENNSYLVANIA – THE SONG! |url=https://duquesnehunky.com/2012/10/17/duquesne-pennsylvania-the-song/ |access-date=2024-07-30 |website=The Duquesne Hunky |language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn the February 7, 1953, edition,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8QwEAAAAMBAJ&q=%22Jimmy+Rogers+Snow%22&pg=PA42|title=Billboard|page=42|date=7 February 1953|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|access-date=11 October 2021|via=Google Books|archive-date=3 March 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230303220937/https://books.google.com/books?id=8QwEAAAAMBAJ&q=%22Jimmy+Rogers+Snow%22&pg=PA42|url-status=live}}</ref> ''Billboard'' magazine reported that Snow's then-17-year-old son, Jimmie Rodgers Snow, had signed with RCA Victor, and that the younger Snow would \"record duets with his father,\" as well as cover his own material.\n\n===Rainbow Ranch===\nSnow bought a ranch home in [[Madison, Tennessee]], shortly after he experienced success with \"I've Been Everywhere\" and \"I'm Movin' On.\" He named the home '[[Rainbow Ranch (Nashville, Tennessee)|Rainbow Ranch]]' after his band, which was known as the \"Rainbow Ranch Boys.\" In recent years the home has been restored by Snow's family.<ref name=\"WOC\">{{cite news |last1=Sawyer |first1=Bobbie Jean |title=You Can Spend the Night at Hank Snow's Ranch |url=https://www.wideopencountry.com/can-spend-night-hank-snows-ranch/ |access-date=7 December 2022 |publisher=Wide Open Country |date=21 December 2019 |archive-date=7 December 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221207160818/https://www.wideopencountry.com/can-spend-night-hank-snows-ranch/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The home was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Davidson County, Tennessee]] on November 27, 2018.<ref name=\"NRHP\">{{cite web |title=National Register Digital Assets - Rainbow Ranch |url=https://npgallery.nps.gov/AssetDetail/NRIS/100003154 |website=npgallery |publisher=National Park Service U.S. Department of the Interior |access-date=7 December 2022 |archive-date=7 December 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221207003659/https://npgallery.nps.gov/AssetDetail/NRIS/100003154 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Elvis Presley===\nA regular at the Grand Ole Opry, in 1954 Snow persuaded the directors to allow a young [[Elvis Presley]] on stage. Snow used Presley as his opening act and introduced him to [[Colonel Tom Parker]]. In August 1955, Snow and Parker formed the management team Hank Snow Attractions. This partnership signed a management contract with Presley, but before long, Snow was out and Parker had full control over the rock singer's career. Forty years after leaving Parker, Snow stated, \"I have worked with several managers over the years and have had respect for them all except one. Tom Parker [Snow refused to recognize the honorary title \"Colonel\"] was the most egotistical, obnoxious human being I've ever had dealings with.\"\n\n===Later career===\nPerforming in lavish and colorful sequin-studded suits, Snow had a career covering six decades, during which he sold more than 80 million albums. Although he became a [[Naturalization|naturalized]] American citizen in 1958, he still maintained friendships in Canada. He also continued to reference Canada in his works, such as with the 1968 album ''My Nova Scotia Home''.\n\nDespite his lack of schooling, Snow was a gifted songwriter and in 1978 was elected to the [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]]. In Canada, he was ten times voted that country's top country music performer. In 1979, he was elected to the [[Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum|Country Music Hall of Fame]], the [[Canadian Music Hall of Fame]] and the Nova Scotia Music Hall of Fame. He was also inducted into the [[Canadian Country Music Hall of Fame]] in 1985.\n\nHis autobiography, ''The Hank Snow Story'', was published in 1994, and later The Hank Snow Country Music Centre opened near his ancestral home in [[Liverpool, Nova Scotia]]. A victim of [[child abuse]],{{citation needed|date=August 2023}} he established the Hank Snow International Foundation For Prevention Of Child Abuse.\n\n==Illness and death==\nIn 1996, Snow began experiencing respiratory problems that forced him to retire from performing. He died three years later on December 20, 1999, aged 85, at his [[Rainbow Ranch (Nashville, Tennessee)|Rainbow Ranch]] in [[Madison, Tennessee]], and was interred in Nashville's [[Spring Hill Cemetery (Nashville)|Spring Hill Cemetery]].<ref>{{Cite news | date = 1999-12-20 | newspaper = [[The Chicago Tribune]] | title = Hank Snow, movin country music hall | url = http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1999-12-20/news/9912210013_1_hank-snow-movin-country-music-hall | access-date = 2011-07-31 | archive-date = 2012-10-01 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121001222750/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1999-12-20/news/9912210013_1_hank-snow-movin-country-music-hall | url-status = dead }}</ref> His wife Minnie died on May 12, 2003, in Madison, Tennessee.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.tributes.com/show/Minnie-B.-Snow-48444893 | title = Tributes | website = Tributes.com | access-date = 2013-04-02 | archive-date = 2016-05-13 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160513205301/http://www.tributes.com/show/Minnie-B.-Snow-48444893 | url-status = live }}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:NS-01204 - Hank Snow Statue (26921085594).jpg|alt=From Dennis Jarvis|thumb|Hank Snow's statue at the Hank Snow Hometown Museum in Liverpool, Nova Scotia.]]\n[[Elvis Presley]], [[The Rolling Stones]], [[Ray Charles]], [[Ashley MacIsaac]], [[Johnny Cash]] and [[Emmylou Harris]], among others, have covered his music.\n\nOne of his last top hits, \"[[Hello Love (song)|Hello Love]]\", was sung by [[Garrison Keillor]] to open each broadcast of his ''[[Prairie Home Companion]]'' radio show. The song became Snow's seventh and final number 1 hit on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs|Hot Country Singles]] chart in April 1974. At 59 years and 11 months, Snow became the oldest country artist to have a top song on the chart. It was an accomplishment that Snow held for more than 26 years, until [[Kenny Rogers]]'s hit record in May 2000 (at 61 years and nine months), \"[[Buy Me a Rose]]\". ([[Dolly Parton]] and [[Willie Nelson]] subsequently reached the top of the chart at older ages as secondary duet partners on records fronted by other artists.)\n\nIn [[Robert Altman]]'s 1975 film ''[[Nashville (film)|Nashville]]'', [[Henry Gibson]] played a self-obsessed country star partly based on Hank Snow.<ref>https://www.houstonpress.com/music/lonesome-onry-and-mean-hank-snow-movin-on-to-altmans-nashville-and-george-wallace-6513034</ref> Snow is played by Australian actor [[David Wenham]] in [[Baz Luhrmann]]'s ''[[Elvis (2022 film)|Elvis]]''.<ref name=\"Screen Jalali\">{{cite news |last1=Jalali |first1=Jessica |title=Elvis (2022): Where You've Seen The Cast Before |url=https://screenrant.com/elvis-2022-cast-previous-movies-tv-shows/ |access-date=December 31, 2022 |work=ScreenRant |date=June 12, 2022 |archive-date=January 1, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230101000554/https://screenrant.com/elvis-2022-cast-previous-movies-tv-shows/ |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nSnow is referenced in the opening lines of [[Jimmy Buffett]]'s 1974 song \"The Wino and I Know.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.buffettnews.com/resources/songs/?song=17 |title=Jimmy Buffett Song & Lyrics Database |website=BuffettNews.com |date=18 February 2008 |access-date=2013-04-02 |archive-date=2012-08-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120807020128/http://www.buffettnews.com/resources/songs/?song=17 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe character of [[Heikki Lunta]], a fictitious Finnish snow god in the local culture of Michigan's Upper Peninsula, is named from the Finnish translation of Hank Snow.
