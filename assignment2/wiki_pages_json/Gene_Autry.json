Between 1950 and 1956, he hosted ''[[The Gene Autry Show]]'' television series. In many of them, he appeared with his [[Morgan horse|Morgan]] named [[Champion the Wonder Horse|Champion]].\n\nAutry was also one of the most important pioneering figures in the history of [[country music]], considered the second major influential artist of the genre's development after [[Jimmie Rodgers]].<ref name=\"cusic\" /> His films were the first media vehicle to carry Western music to a nationwide audience.<ref name=\"cusic\" />\n\nIn addition to his signature song \"[[Back in the Saddle Again]]\", as well as his recording hit \"[[At Mail Call Today]]\", Autry is still remembered for his association with [[Christmas music]], having debuted the seasonal standards \"[[Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Reindeer (song)|Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Reindeer]]\", \"[[Frosty the Snowman]]\", and \"[[Here Comes Santa Claus]]\".\n\nAutry is a member of both the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] and the [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]].

In the autumn of 1928, he auditioned for the [[Victor Talking Machine Company]], shortly before purchase by [[David Sarnoff]]'s [[RCA|Radio Corporation of America]] (RCA). According to [[Nathaniel Shilkret]],<ref>Shilkret, Nathaniel, ed. Niel Shell and Barbara Shilkret, ''Nathaniel Shilkret: Sixty Years in the Music Business'', Scarecrow Press, Lanham, Maryland, 2005. {{ISBN|0-8108-5128-8}}.</ref> director of Light Music for Victor at the time, Autry asked to speak to Shilkret after finding that he had been turned down. Shilkret explained to Autry that he was turned down not because of his voice, but because Victor had just made contracts with two similar singers. Autry left with a letter of introduction from Shilkret and the advice to sing on radio to gain experience and to come back in a year or two. In 1928, Autry was singing on [[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]] radio station KVOO (now [[KOTV (AM)|KOTV]]) as \"Oklahoma's Yodeling Cowboy\". The Victor archives<ref>Victor Recording Book, p.&nbsp;7247. (This is a page from Victor's daily log of recordings.)</ref> show an October 9, 1929, entry stating that the vocal duet of Jimmie Long and Gene Autry with two [[steel guitar|Hawaiian guitar]]s, directed by L. L. Watson, recorded \"My Dreaming of You\" (Matrix 56761) and \"My Alabama Home\" (Matrix 56762).\n\nAutry signed a recording deal with [[Columbia Records]] in 1929. He worked in [[Chicago]] on the [[WLS (AM)|WLS-AM]] radio show ''[[National Barn Dance]]'' for four years, and with his own show, where he met singer-songwriter [[Smiley Burnette]]. In his early recording career, Autry covered various genres, including a labor song, \"The Death of [[Mary Harris Jones|Mother Jones]]\", in 1931.\n\n[[File:Gene Autry 1942.JPG|thumb|left|Gene Autry in 1942]]\nAutry also recorded many \"[[hillbilly]]\"-style records in 1930 and 1931 in New York City, which were certainly different in style and content from his later recordings. These were much closer in style to the [[Salty Holmes|Prairie Ramblers]] or [[Dick Justice (singer)|Dick Justice]], and included the \"Do Right, Daddy Blues\" and \"Black Bottom Blues\", both similar to \"[[Deep Elm Blues|Deep Elem Blues]]\". These late [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]]-era songs deal with [[moonshine|bootlegging]], [[Police corruption|corrupt police]], and women whose occupation was certainly vice. These recordings are generally not heard today, but are available on European import labels, such as [[JSP Records]]. His first hit was in 1932 with \"[[That Silver-Haired Daddy of Mine]]\", a duet with fellow railroad man Jimmy Long that Autry and Long co-wrote.\n\nAs Autry's movie career flourished, so did his record sales. His unofficial theme song became the [[Raymond Otis Whitley|Ray Whitley]] composition \"[[Back in the Saddle Again]]\".<ref name=pc9>{{Gilliland |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19757/m1/ |title=Show 9 – Tennessee Firebird: American country music before and after Elvis.

His records sold more than 100 million copies and he has more than a dozen [[music recording certification|gold and platinum]] records, including the first record ever certified gold.\n\nToday's listeners associate Gene Autry with Christmas songs, which are played perennially during each holiday season. These include \"[[Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town]]\", his own composition \"[[Here Comes Santa Claus]]\", \"[[Frosty the Snowman]]\", and his biggest hit, \"[[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (song)|Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Reindeer]]\". He wrote \"Here Comes Santa Claus\" after being the Grand Marshal of the 1946 Santa Claus Lane Parade (now the [[Hollywood Christmas Parade]]). He heard all of the spectators watching the parade saying, \"Here comes Santa Claus!\" virtually handing him the title for his song. He recorded his version of the song in 1947 and it became an instant classic.\n\nIn the late 1950s he began recording other artists, as the original owner of [[Challenge Records (1950s)|Challenge Records]]. The label's biggest hit was \"[[Tequila (The Champs song)|Tequila]]\" by [[The Champs]] in 1958, which started the [[rock and roll]] [[instrumental]] craze of the late 1950s and early 1960s. He sold the label soon after, but the maroon (later green) label has the \"GA\" in a shield above the label name.\n\n=== Film career ===\n[[File:Gene Autry in Oh, Susanna!.png|right|thumb|Gene Autry in ''[[Oh, Susanna! (1936 film)|Oh, Susanna!]]'', 1936]]\nAutry and Burnette were discovered by film producer [[Nat Levine]] in 1934. Together, Autry and Burnette made their film debut for [[Mascot Pictures]] Corp. in ''[[In Old Santa Fe]]'' as part of a singing cowboy quartet; he was then given the starring role by Levine in 1935 in the 12-part [[Serial (film)|serial]] ''[[The Phantom Empire]]''. Shortly thereafter, Mascot was absorbed by the newly formed [[Republic Pictures|Republic Pictures Corp.]] and Autry went along to make a further 44 films up to 1940. Most were low-budget [[western (genre)|Westerns]] in which he played under his own name, rode his horse [[Champion the Wonder Horse|Champion]], had Smiley Burnette as his regular [[sidekick]], and had many opportunities to sing in each film. His films were tremendously successful, so much so that almost every other studio tried to compete by showcasing their own singing cowboys. By 1940 Autry was Republic's biggest star, and his films became more costly and more elaborate. They played first-run in large cities, unlike the usual \"B\" westerns that played in neighborhood theaters.<ref>Wyatt, Tom and Greenland, David. \"B Western Cowboys: Part I\", ''[[Classic Images]]''.

S. Army Air Corps during World War II. Part of his military service included his broadcast of a radio show for one year; it involved music and true stories. Several decades ago on an early afternoon show featuring Republic westerns, one of Gene's sidekicks said that when Gene told Republic Pictures of his intentions to join the military during World War II, Republic threatened to promote Roy Rogers as \"King of the Cowboys\" in Gene's absence, which it did. Republic reissued old Autry westerns during the war years, to keep his name before the public.\n\nAutry's contract had been suspended for the duration of his military service, and he had tried to have it declared void after his discharge. The courts found in Republic's favor, and Autry returned to Republic after the war. He finished out his contract with four more features, with Autry now publicized as \"King of the Singing Cowboys\".\n\nIn 1947 Autry left Republic for [[Columbia Pictures]], which offered him his own production unit. He chose a new sidekick, [[Pat Buttram]], recently returned from his [[World War II]] service. Buttram would co-star with Gene Autry in more than 40 films and in more than 100 episodes of [[The Gene Autry Show|Autry's television show]]. In 1951, Autry formed his own company (Flying A Productions) to make westerns under his own control, and Columbia continued to distribute them through 1953.\n\n==== Melody Ranch ====\nAutry purchased the 110-acre [[Movie ranch#Monogram Ranch/Melody Ranch|Monogram Ranch]] in 1953, in [[Placerita Canyon State Park|Placerita Canyon]] near [[Newhall, California]], in the northern [[San Gabriel Mountains]] foothills. He renamed it the Melody Ranch after his movie ''[[Melody Ranch]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scvhistory.com/scvhistory/sg032903.htm|title=Movie Magic in Placerita Canyon|website=Scvhistory.com|access-date=May 15, 2010}}</ref> Autry then sold 98 acres of the property, most of the original ranch. The Western town, [[adobe]]s, and ranch cabin [[Set construction|sets]] and open land for [[location shooting]] were retained as a movie ranch on 12 acres. Numerous \"B\" Westerns and TV shows were shot there during Autry's ownership, including the initial years of ''[[Gunsmoke]]'' with [[James Arness]]. A decade after he purchased Melody Ranch, a [[wildfire|brushfire]] swept through in August 1962, destroying most of the original standing sets and dashing Autry's plans to turn it into a museum. However, the devastated landscape did prove useful for productions such as ''[[Combat!]]''. A complete adobe ranch survived at the northeast section of the ranch.<ref>{{cite web|title=Placeritos Ranch/Monogram Ranch/Melody Ranch|url=http://www.movielocationsplus.com/MELODY.HTM|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160913080512/http://movielocationsplus.com/MELODY.HTM|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 13, 2016|website=Movielocationsplus.com|access-date=December 24, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://scvhistory.com/scvhistory/autry.htm|website=Scvhistory.com|title=Memories of the place I called Melody Ranch|first=Gene|last=Autry|access-date=February 2, 2008}}</ref>\n\nAccording to a published story by Autry, the fire caused him to turn his attention to [[Griffith Park]], where he would build his Museum of Western Heritage (now known as the [[Autry Museum of the American West]]).\n\nIn 1990, after his favorite horse Champion Three, which lived in retirement there, died, Autry put the remaining 12-acre ranch up for sale. It was purchased by the [[General Lee (car)#The Veluzat era|Veluzat family]] in 1991 and rebuilt.

His horse, Champion, also had a [[Mutual Broadcasting System|Mutual]] radio series, ''[[The Adventures of Champion (radio series)|The Adventures of Champion]]'' and a [[CBS|CBS-TV]] series of [[The Adventures of Champion (TV series)|the same name]]. In response to his many young radio listeners aspiring to emulate him, Autry created the Cowboy Code, or Ten Cowboy Commandments. These tenets promoting an ethical, moral, and patriotic lifestyle that appealed to youth organizations such as the [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scouts]], which developed similar doctrines. The Cowboy Code consisted of rules that were \"a natural progression of Gene's philosophies going back to his first ''[[Gene Autry's Melody Ranch|Melody Ranch]]'' programs—and early pictures.\"<ref name=\"george-256\">{{harvnb|George-Warren|2007|p=256}}</ref> According to the code:\n# The Cowboy must never shoot first, hit a smaller man, or take unfair advantage.\n# He must never go back on his word, or a trust confided in him.\n# He must always tell the truth.\n# He must be gentle with children, the elderly, and animals.\n# He must not advocate or possess racially or religiously intolerant ideas.\n# He must help people in distress.\n# He must be a good worker.\n# He must keep himself clean in thought, speech, action, and personal habits.\n# He must respect women, parents, and his nation's laws.\n# The Cowboy is a patriot.\n\nBeginning in 1950, he produced and starred in his own television show on [CBS through his Flying A Productions studio. In the late 1950s, Autry also made several appearances on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC-TV]]'s ''[[Ozark Jubilee|Jubilee USA]]''.\n\n=== Military career ===\nDuring World War II, Autry enlisted in the [[United States Army]] in 1942, and became a [[technical sergeant|tech sergeant]] in the United States Army Air Corps. Holding a private [[pilot licensing and certification|pilot certificate]], he was determined to become a military pilot and earned his [[Auxiliary Pilot Badge|Service Pilot]] rating in June 1944, serving as a [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator#C-109 version|C-109]] transport pilot with the rank of [[flight officer]].

It was known as the Flying A Ranch and encompassed 1200 acres. It served as headquarters for his traveling rodeo. The nearby town of Berwyn, then honored Autry by naming the town after him. Thirty Five thousand people attended the ceremony on November 16, 1941. A year later, he became a partner in the World Championship Rodeo Company, which furnished [[livestock]] for many of the country's major rodeos. In 1954, he acquired Montana's top [[bucking]] string from the estate of Leo J. Cremer Sr., and put Canadian [[bronc riding|saddle bronc riding]] champion Harry Knight in charge of the operation. A merger with the World Championship Rodeo Company in 1956 made Autry the sole owner. He moved the entire company to a {{convert|24000|acre|km2|adj=on}} ranch near [[Fowler, Colorado]], with Knight as the working partner in the operation. For the next 12 years, they provided livestock for most of the major rodeos in Texas, Colorado, Montana, and Nebraska. When the company was sold in 1968, both men continued to be active in rodeo.

The toy was commissioned by Kenton vice-president Willard Bixler, who had conceptualized an iron cap revolver modeled after the pearl-handled gun used by Gene Autry. Selling at 50 cents per gun, the cap pistols were extremely popular and by 1939, two million units of the toy had been sold in the [[United States]] and abroad. Autry received a portion of all sales revenues.<ref>{{Cite web|title=GeneAutry.com: Kenton, Ohio|url=https://www.geneautry.com/clubhouse/places/kenton_oh.html|access-date=2020-12-31|website=Geneautry.com|archive-date=November 30, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201130041529/https://www.geneautry.com/clubhouse/places/kenton_oh.html|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Rosen |first1=Steven |title=Autry spurs festival |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/194127023/ |access-date=6 September 2023 |work=Newspapers.com |publisher=Los Angeles Times |date=30 June 2009 |page=D3 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n=== Baseball ===\n[[File:AngelsRetired26.png|right|thumb|150px|Gene Autry's number 26 was retired by the [[California Angels]] in 1982.]]\nIn the 1950s, Autry had been a minority owner of the minor-league [[Hollywood Stars]]. In 1960, when [[Major League Baseball]] announced plans to add an expansion team in Los Angeles, Autry—who had once declined an opportunity to play in the [[Minor League Baseball|minor leagues]]—expressed an interest in acquiring the radio broadcast rights to the team's games. Baseball executives were so impressed by his approach that he was persuaded to become the owner of the franchise rather than simply its broadcast partner. The team, initially called the [[Los Angeles Angels]] upon its 1961 debut, moved to suburban [[Anaheim, California|Anaheim]] in 1966, and was renamed the California Angels, then the Anaheim Angels from 1997 until 2005, when it became the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. Autry served as vice president of the [[American League]] from 1983 until his death. In 1995, he sold a quarter share of the team to [[the Walt Disney Company]] and a controlling interest the following year, with the remaining share to be transferred after his death. Earlier, in 1982, he sold Los Angeles television station [[KTLA]] for $245&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Rosenstiel |first1=Thomas B. |title=Tribune Co.

The chosen number reflected that baseball's rosters (at the time) had 25 men, so Autry's unflagging support for his team made him the \"26th man\" (see also the ''[[12th man (football)|12th man]]'', a similar concept in football). When the Angels finally won their first (and to date, only) [[2002 World Series|World Series championship in 2002]], star outfielder [[Tim Salmon]] held Autry's cowboy hat aloft during the on-field celebration, and the public address system played his hit song, \"[[Back in the Saddle Again]]\".\n\n===Hotels===\nHe invested in property, owning by 1964 the [[Mark Hopkins Hotel]] in San Francisco; the [[Andaz West Hollywood|Hotel Continental]] in Hollywood; the Sahara Inn, a $12-million motel near Chicago; plus property in [[Palm Springs]].<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=January 8, 1964|last=Green|first=Abel|author-link=Abel Green|title=A Year of Tragedy & Trifles|page=3}}</ref>\n\n=== Retirement ===\nAutry retired from show business in 1964, having made almost 100 films up to 1955 and over 600 records. He was elected to the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] in 1969 and to the [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Gene Autry|url=http://nashvillesongwritersfoundation.com/Site/inductee?entry_id=1157|series=Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame|website=Nashvillesongwritersfoundation.com|access-date=December 24, 2017|language=en}}</ref> in 1970. After retiring, he invested widely in real estate, radio, and television. He also invested in ownership of the KOOL-TV CBS-affiliate (now [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliate [[KSAZ-TV]]) in [[Phoenix, Arizona]], which created local shows such as the weekly bilingual children's show ''Niños Contentos''.\n\nRepublic Pictures, its finances failing, had shut down production in 1957. By the late 1960s Republic was barely operational, managing only its film library. Gene Autry, correctly assessing the company's cash-poor situation, made a cash offer for the rights and negatives to his Republic films. The company accepted Autry's terms, and Autry now controlled the film materials for home-movie reprints and home-video tapes and discs.\n\n=== Death ===\n[[File:Gene Autry Grave.JPG|thumb|150px|Grave of Gene Autry, at Forest Lawn Hollywood Hills.]]\nAutry died of [[lymphoma]] on October 2, 1998, at his home in [[Studio City, Los Angeles|Studio City, California]].

Approximately 35,000 people attended the ceremonies broadcast live from the site on Autry's ''[[Gene Autry's Melody Ranch|Melody Ranch]]'' radio show. Expectations that Autry would make his permanent home on the ranch were heightened when Autry's house in California burned down just 8 days before the name change ceremony, but dashed three weeks later with the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]].<ref name =\"SaddleAgain\"/> Autry\njoined the military in 1942 and sold the ranch after the war.<ref name =\"SaddleAgain\"/>\n\nIn 1972, he was inducted into the [[Hall of Great Western Performers]] at the [[National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum|National Cowboy Hall of Fame and Western Heritage Center]] in [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]].
