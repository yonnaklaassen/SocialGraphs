In 2023 and 2024, Martin had his first charted entry with the single \"[[We Ride (Bryan Martin song)|We Ride]]\".\n\n==Biography==\nMartin was born in [[Logansport, Louisiana]]. As a teenager, he worked on an [[oil rig]] in addition to playing [[American football]] and [[bull riding]]. He broke his collar bone doing the latter, after which he developed an addiction to [[painkiller]]s. After this, he briefly enlisted in the [[United States Army]] and, after an attempted suicide, began recording music.<ref name=\"people\">{{cite web | url=https://people.com/country/bryan-martin-wolves-cry-music-video-premiere/ | title=Bryan Martin on How Writing Music After Misfiring a Gun Saved His Life: 'I've Lived Through It' | publisher=People | date=January 27, 2023 | accessdate=April 15, 2024}}</ref>\n\nMartin released the albums ''If It Was Easy'' in 2019 and ''Self Inflicted Scars'' two years later. In late 2022, his song \"We Ride\", released through [[Average Joes Entertainment]], began receiving attention on [[TikTok]]. By 2023, \"We Ride\" had begun charting on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Country Airplay]] charts, also reaching the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in early 2024. The song is on Martin's third album ''Poets & Old Souls''.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.billboard.com/music/chart-beat/bryan-martin-hot-100-debut-we-ride-1235641406/ | title=Hot 100 First-Timers: Bryan Martin Scores His First Chart Hit With ‘We Ride’ | publisher=Billboard | date=March 26, 2024 | accessdate=April 15, 2024}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/bulletins.billboard.com/country/country_update_2024_0412.pdf | title=Billboard Country Update | publisher=Billboard | date=April 12, 2024 | accessdate=April 15, 2024}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the song's release, Martin was booked as an opening act for [[Morgan Wallen]] and [[Warren Zeiders]].<ref name=\"people\"/><ref>{{cite web | url=https://tasteofcountry.com/bryan-martin-we-ride/ | title=Bryan Martin's rebellious side roams free in 'We Ride' [Listen] | publisher=[[Taste of Country]] | date=March 7, 2024 | accessdate=April 15, 2024}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n===Albums===\n*''It Was Easy'' (2019)\n*''Self Inflicted Scars'' (2022)\n*''Poets & Old Souls'' (2023)\n\n===Singles===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+List of singles, with selected peak chart positions\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Title\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Year\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"4\"| Peak chart positions\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| [[Music recording sales certification|Certifications]]\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Album\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%\"| [[Billboard Hot 100|US]]<br /><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/2024-07-20|title=''Billboard'' Hot 100: Week of July 20, 2024|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=July 16, 2024}}</ref>\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%\"| [[Hot Country Songs|US Country]]<br /><ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://bulletins.billboard.com/country/country_update_2024_0506.pdf|title=Billboard Country Update|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=May 6, 2024|access-date=May 7, 2024}}</ref>\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%\"| [[Country Airplay|US Country Airplay]]<br /><ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://bulletins.billboard.com/country/country_update_2024_0712.pdf|title=Billboard Country Update|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=July 12, 2024|access-date=July 13, 2024}}</ref>\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%\"| [[Canada Country|CAN Country]]<br /><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/canada-country/2024-08-03|title=Canada Country: Week of August 3, 2024|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=July 30, 2024}}</ref>\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"[[We Ride (Bryan Martin song)|We Ride]]\"\n| 2023\n| 56 || 16 || 3 || 12\n|\n* RIAA: Platinum{{Certification Cite Ref|region=United States|type=single|title=We Ride|artist=Bryan Martin}}\n| ''Poets & Old Souls''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Wolves Cry\"\n|2024\n|—\n|—\n|—\n|—\n|\n|TBA\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Martin, Bryan}}\n[[Category:American country singer-songwriters]]\n[[Category:Average Joes Entertainment artists]]\n[[Category:Country musicians from Louisiana]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Year of birth missing (living people)]]\n\n[[Category:People from DeSoto Parish, Louisiana]]"
