At age 18, she made her debut on the country music scene with the single \"Ain't What It Used to Be,\" a Top 40 hit on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts. Her debut album was originally slated for release in 2006 but was never released.<ref name=\"fort\">{{cite news|url=http://www.journalgazette.net/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071005/ENT02/710050387 |title=Singing a Broken record |accessdate=December 13, 2007 |last=Penhollow |first=Steve |date=October 5, 2007 |newspaper=[[Fort Wayne Journal-Gazette]]}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\nMullins was born in [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]].<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/megan-mullins-mn0001521468 | title=Megan Mullins Songs, Albums, Reviews, Bio & More | website=[[AllMusic]] }}</ref> She began to learn several instruments at an early age, and by age 3, she had won the Indiana State Fair Showmanship award at the State Fiddle Championship.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> Many of her family members are also professional musicians, most notably her brother Marcus, with whom she performed on the [[Grand Ole Opry]] at age 14.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/>\n\nBy 2006, she was signed to [[Broken Bow Records]], an independent record label. Her first single, titled \"Ain't What It Used to Be\" (also recorded by [[Billy Currington]] on his debut album) was issued early that year, reaching a peak of No.&nbsp;32 on the country music charts. A second single, \"Cryin' Days,\" failed to chart at all, and Mullins announced in October 2007 that she would be returning to the studio for further work on the album.<ref name=\"fort\"/>\n\nAlthough the album has not been released, Mullins remained on Broken Bow's roster. In 2008, Mullins recorded a duet with former [[Alabama (American band)|Alabama]] lead singer [[Randy Owen]] (who is also signed to Broken Bow), for his solo debut album ''[[One on One (Randy Owen album)|One on One]]''. Mullins also plays fiddle in Owen's road band.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/concertreview.asp?xid=327 |title=Randy Owen leaves Alabama behind |accessdate=December 2, 2008 |last=Remz |first=Jeffrey B. |date=August 3, 2008|work=[[Country Standard Time]]}}</ref> In April 2009, she switched to Stoney Creek, a sister label also started by the founder of Broken Bow. Her first release for Stoney Creek, \"Long Past Gone\", made its chart debut in May 2009, and peaked at No.&nbsp;48 later in the year. A second single for the label, \"Tradin' My Halo for Horns,\" failed to chart. In August 2010, Mullins and Stoney Creek parted ways.\n\n==Discography==\n===Singles===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Year\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Single\n! colspan=\"1\"| Peak positions\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Album\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n! width=\"60\"| [[Hot Country Songs|US Country]]\n|-\n| 2006\n| align=\"left\"| \"Ain't What It Used to Be\"\n| 32\n| align=\"left\" rowspan=\"2\"| ''Megan Mullins'' <small>(unreleased)</small>\n|-\n| 2007\n| align=\"left\"| \"Cryin' Days\"\n| —\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 2009\n| align=\"left\"| \"Long Past Gone\"\n| 48\n| rowspan=\"2\" {{n/a}}\n|-\n| align=\"left\"| \"Tradin' My Halo for Horns\"\n| —\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" style=\"font-size:8pt\"| \"—\" denotes releases that failed to chart\n|-\n|}\n\n===Guest singles===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!
