Thorn and Ezell left the band in the mid-1990s, with Rocky Thacker taking over on bass guitar; Keyboardist [[Stan Munsey]] joined the line up in 1995, until his departure in 2018. The band split up in 1997 after Raybon left.  Seales and McGuire reformed the band in 2000 with lead singer Brent Lamb, who was in turn replaced by [[Curtis Wright]] and then by [[Jimmy Yeary]]. Ezell rejoined in the early 2000s, and after his 2007 death, he was replaced by Mike Folsom. Raybon returned to the band in 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://theboot.com/marty-raybon-shenandoah/|title = Marty Raybon Rejoins Shenandoah|date = 2014-08-28|access-date = 2014-09-05|website = The Boot|publisher = Taste of Country Network|last = Stefano|first = Angela}}</ref> That same year, Jamie Michael replaced the retiring Jim Seales on lead guitar.\n\nShenandoah has released nine [[studio album]]s, of which two have been certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]].
