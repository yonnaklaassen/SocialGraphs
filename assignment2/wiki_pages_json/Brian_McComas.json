Originally signed to [[Mercury Nashville Records]], and then [[Lyric Street Records]] in 2001, McComas charted two minor singles in 2001 and 2002. A year later, he charted the Top Ten single \"[[99.9% Sure (I've Never Been Here Before)]]\" on the ''Billboard'' Hot Country Singles & Tracks charts. His eponymous debut album was also released that year. It produced an additional single before McComas was dropped from Lyric Street. He later signed to Katapult Records, which released his second album, ''Back Up Again'', in 2006.\n\n==Biography==\nMcComas was born in [[Bethesda, Maryland]], and his family moved to [[Harrison, Arkansas]] when he was four years old. At age sixteen, he attended a [[Paul Overstreet]] concert; while at the concert, Overstreet gave McComas the address of his publishing company. McComas submitted a demo tape to the publishing company, who then encouraged him to continue working on his writing skills.<ref name=\"allmusic\">[http://www.allmusic.com/artist/brian-mccomas-mn0000618766 Profile], Allmusic.com; accessed September 6, 2015.</ref><ref name=\"cmt\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20040121034511/http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/mccomas_brian/bio.jhtml McComas profile], cmt.com; accessed September 6, 2015.</ref>\n\nMcComas later attended college, but soon dropped out to move to [[Nashville, Tennessee]].<ref name=\"cmt\"/> He briefly signed with [[Mercury Records]], before he landed a deal with Lyric Street in 2001, charting the singles \"Night Disappear With You\" and \"I Could Never Love You Enough.\"<ref name=\"whitburn\">{{cite book|author=Joel Whitburn|authorlink=Joel Whitburn|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2008|publisher=Record Research, Inc|year=2008|page=266|isbn=978-0-89820-177-2}}</ref> In 2003, he landed his first Top 10, \"[[99.9% Sure (I've Never Been Here Before)]]\"<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> and the follow-up \"You're in My Head\", a No.&nbsp;21 hit on the country charts.
