The band was formed in 2002 by Michael Reynolds (lead vocals), brothers Michael Jeffers (vocals, bass guitar) and Chad Jeffers ([[Dobro]], [[lap steel guitar]]), and Rick Schell (drums, vocals). Their first album, ''Speak No Evil'', was released independently in 2002. Later that same year, they signed to [[BNA Records]] and released their [[Pinmonkey (album)|self-titled album]]. It produced the singles \"Barbed Wire and Roses\" and \"[[I Drove All Night]]\", both of which charted on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now [[Hot Country Songs]]) charts. Schell departed, with Mike Crouch taking his place as drummer; Chad Jeffers also left to join [[Keith Urban]]'s road band. Reduced to a trio composed of Mike Crouch, Michael Jeffers, and Michael Reynolds, Pinmonkey released their third album (titled ''Big Shiny Cars'') on the independent Back Porch label in 2006 before disbanding.\n\n==Biography==\nPinmonkey was founded in 2002 by Michael Reynolds (lead vocals), Rick Schell (drums, vocals), Michael Jeffers (bass guitar, vocals), and Chad Jeffers ([[Dobro]], [[lap steel guitar]]), the latter two of whom are brothers.<ref name=\"whitburn\"/> The Jeffers brothers are natives of [[Kingsport, Tennessee]], and had played in a band called the Habaneros, which was based out of [[Murfreesboro, Tennessee|Murfreesboro]], in the 1990s. Chad attended [[Belmont University]] and after graduating in 1994, he worked in the mail room of Starstruck Studios, a recording studio owned by [[Reba McEntire]], in addition to touring with [[the Wilkinsons]]. Rick Schell, a native of [[Homer, New York]], had moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]] in 1993 and had been hired to play on [[Steve Earle]]'s ''[[I Feel Alright]]'' album, leading to him also playing for [[Joy Lynn White]], [[Buddy Miller]], and [[Elizabeth Cook]]. Michael Reynolds had moved to Nashville after graduating high school, and was working at a [[McDonald's]] restaurant when he befriended Chad Jeffers. This led to the formation of Pinmonkey, and all four began performing at the Sutler, a club in Nashville, soon after their foundation.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cmt.com/news/1458300/pinmonkey-step-boldly-toward-bluegrass/ | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211205151209/http://www.cmt.com/news/1458300/pinmonkey-step-boldly-toward-bluegrass/ | url-status=dead | archive-date=December 5, 2021 | title=Pinmonkey Step Boldly Toward Bluegrass | work=CMT | date=October 23, 2002 | accessdate=November 20, 2018 | author=Craig Shelburne}}</ref>\n\nThe four musicians derived their band name Pinmonkey from \"[[And Maggie Makes Three]]\", an episode of the cartoon ''[[The Simpsons]]''.
