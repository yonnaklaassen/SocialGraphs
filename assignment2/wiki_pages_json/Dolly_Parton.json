Her first country single, \"Dumb Blonde\" (composed by [[Curly Putman]], one of the few songs during this era that she recorded but did not write), reached number 24 on the country chart in 1967, followed by \"Something Fishy\", which went to number 17.

As documented in her 1994 autobiography,<ref name=allMusicGuide/> initially, much of Wagoner's audience was unhappy that [[Norma Jean (singer)|Norma Jean]], the performer whom Parton had replaced, had left the show, and was reluctant to accept Parton (sometimes chanting loudly for Norma Jean from the audience).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/301080/dolly-parton/biography|title=Dolly Parton-Biography|magazine=Billboard|access-date=May 18, 2013}}</ref> With Wagoner's assistance, however, Parton was eventually accepted. Wagoner convinced his label, [[RCA Victor]], to sign her. RCA decided to protect their investment by releasing her first single as a [[duet]] with Wagoner. That song, a remake of [[Tom Paxton]]'s \"[[The Last Thing on My Mind]]\", released in late 1967, reached the country Top{{spaces}}10 in January 1968, launching a six-year streak of virtually uninterrupted Top{{spaces}}10 singles for the pair.\n\nParton's first solo single for RCA Victor, \"[[Just Because I'm a Woman (1968 album)#Album information|Just Because I'm a Woman]]\", was released in the summer of 1968 and was a moderate chart hit, reaching number 17. For the next two years, none of her solo efforts{{snd}}even \"[[In the Good Old Days (When Times Were Bad)]]\", which later became a standard{{snd}}were as successful as her duets with Wagoner. The duo was named [[Country Music Association Awards|Vocal Group of the Year]] in 1968 by the [[Country Music Association]], but Parton's solo records were continually ignored. Wagoner had a significant financial stake in her future; as of 1969, he was her co-producer and owned nearly half of Owe-Par,<ref>{{cite web|title=Dolly and Uncle Bill Owens start Owe-Par Publishing Company|date=November 18, 1966|url=http://dollyparton.com/life-and-career/awards_milestones/owe-par-publishing-company/|publisher=Dolly Parton|access-date=June 14, 2015}}</ref> the publishing company Parton had founded with Bill Owens.\n\nBy 1970, both Parton and Wagoner had grown frustrated by her lack of solo chart success.

The record shot to number three, followed closely, in February 1971, by her first number-one single, \"[[Joshua (song)|Joshua]]\".

Parton, who had always envisioned a solo career, made the decision to leave Wagoner's organization; the pair performed their last duet concert in April 1974, and she stopped appearing on his TV show in mid-1974, although they remained affiliated.

In a 2019 episode of the [[Sky Arts]] music series ''Brian Johnson: A Life on the Road'', Parton described finding old cassette tapes and realizing that she had composed both \"Jolene\" and \"I Will Always Love You\" in the same songwriting session, telling Johnson \"Buddy, that was a good night.\" Parton again topped the singles chart in 1975 with \"[[The Bargain Store]]\".<ref>[http://www.dollymania.net/chartb.html On The Charts{{snd}}The Singles], dollymania.net; accessed September 20, 2014.</ref>\n\n===1976–1986: Pop transition===\n[[File:Young-Dolly-Parton.jpg|thumb|upright|Parton in 1977]]\nBetween 1974 and 1980, Parton had a series of country hits, with eight singles reaching number one.

With her 1976 album ''[[All I Can Do (album)|All I Can Do]]'', which she co-produced with Porter Wagoner, Parton began taking more of an active role in production, and began specifically aiming her music in a more mainstream, pop direction. Her first entirely self-produced effort, ''[[New Harvest...First Gathering]]'' (1977), highlighted her pop sensibilities, both in terms of choice of songs – the album contained covers of the pop and R&B classics \"[[My Girl (The Temptations song)|My Girl]]\" and \"[[(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and Higher|Higher and Higher]]\" – and production.<ref>{{cite web|title=New Harvest ...

The result, 1977's ''[[Here You Come Again]]'', became her first million-seller, topping the country album chart and reaching number 20 on the pop chart. The [[Barry Mann]]-[[Cynthia Weil]]-penned [[Here You Come Again (song)|title track]] topped the country singles chart, and became Parton's first Top{{spaces}}10 single on the pop chart (no.{{spaces}}3). A second single, the double A-sided \"[[Two Doors Down (Dolly Parton song)|Two Doors Down]]\"/\"[[It's All Wrong, But It's All Right]]\" topped the country chart and crossed over to the pop Top{{spaces}}20. For the remainder of the 1970s and into the early 1980s, many of her subsequent singles moved up on both charts simultaneously. Her albums during this period were developed specifically for pop-[[crossover (music)|crossover]] success.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dolly Parton's Official Song List|date=November 6, 2014 |url=http://dollyparton.com/music-discography-song-list/|publisher=Dolly Parton|access-date=June 14, 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Dolly Parton and Burnett.jpg|thumb|upright|left|With [[Carol Burnett]], 1979]]\nIn 1978, Parton won a [[Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance]] for her ''Here You Come Again'' album.

During this period, her visibility continued to increase, with multiple television appearances. A highly publicized candid interview on a ''[[Barbara Walters Special]]'' in 1977 (timed to coincide with ''Here You Come Again''{{'s}} release) was followed by appearances in 1978 on [[Cher]]'s ABC [[Cher...

Parton became one of the few female country singers to have a number-one single on the country and pop charts simultaneously. It also received a nomination for an [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]]. Her singles continued to appear consistently in the country Top{{spaces}}10. Between 1981 and 1985, she had twelve Top{{spaces}}10 hits; half of them hit number one. She continued to make inroads on the pop chart as well.

It sold several million copies and produced four Top{{spaces}}10 country hits, including [[Phil Spector]]'s \"[[To Know Him Is to Love Him]]\", which went to number one. ''Trio'' won the [[Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]] and was nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]]. After a further attempt at pop success with ''[[Rainbow (Dolly Parton album)|Rainbow]]'' (1987), including the single \"[[The River Unbroken]]\", it ended up a commercial let-down, causing Parton to focus on recording country material. ''[[White Limozeen]]'' (1989) produced two number one hits in \"[[Why'd You Come in Here Lookin' Like That]]\" and \"[[Yellow Roses (Dolly Parton song)|Yellow Roses]]\". Although Parton's career appeared to be revived, it was actually just a brief revival before contemporary country music came in the early 1990s and moved most veteran artists off the charts.<ref name=allMusicGuide/>\n\n[[File:Dolly Parton with square red earrings.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Dolly Parton at a recording session {{circa|1989}}]]\nA duet with [[Ricky Van Shelton]], \"[[Rockin' Years]]\" (1991) reached number one, though Parton's greatest commercial fortune of the decade came when Whitney Houston recorded \"I Will Always Love You\" for the soundtrack of the feature film ''[[The Bodyguard (1992 film)|The Bodyguard]]'' (1992). Both the single and the album were massively successful. Parton's soundtrack album from the 1992 film, ''[[Straight Talk]]'', however, was less successful.
