In 1952, a heart attack left his father unable to farm.  Through his father's side, he is part of the [[Lee family]] of Virginia ([[Henry Lee II]] and [[Richard Henry Lee]] were two of his 4th-great-grandfathers).  He graduated from Christian Brothers High School in Memphis in 1962 as a merit finalist, a National Honor Society member and the salutatorian of his class. He graduated from [[Williams College]], in [[Williamstown, Massachusetts]], in 1966.

He played in Germany during college study abroad and after graduation. Upon arriving in Quebec in 1967, he joined a local band, Les Astronautes. He also began writing songs, which he performed as a solo artist at the Montreal Folk Workshop and at coffeehouses throughout eastern Canada, adding impetus to a revival in folk music that was taking place across Canada.

Because of his status as a draft-evader, entailing that he was subject to arrest had he entered the country, he was unable to tour in the United States, and he became recognized primarily as a songwriter. His best-known songs include \"Yankee Lady\", \"The Brand New Tennessee Waltz\", \"Mississippi, You're on My Mind\", \"A Showman's Life\",\"Biloxi\", \"That's a Touch I Like\", and \"Every Word You Say\".<ref name=star/> These and others have been recorded by numerous artists.

The song peaked at number 3 on the ''Billboard'' Hot Country Singles chart and at number 4 on the Canadian RPM Country Tracks chart.
