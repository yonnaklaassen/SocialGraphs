In 2003, he signed to [[Universal Music Group Nashville|MCA Nashville Records]]. That same year, his [[Long Black Train|debut album]]'s title track, \"[[Long Black Train (song)|Long Black Train]]\", was his breakthrough single release. His second album, ''[[Your Man (album)|Your Man]]'' (2006) accounted for his first two No.&nbsp;1 hits, \"[[Your Man (Josh Turner song)|Your Man]]\" and \"[[Would You Go with Me]]\", while 2007's ''[[Everything Is Fine]]'' included a No.&nbsp;2 hit, \"[[Firecracker (song)|Firecracker]]\". ''[[Haywire (Josh Turner album)|Haywire]]'', released in 2010, produced his biggest hit, the four-week No.&nbsp;1 hit \"[[Why Don't We Just Dance]]\" and another No.&nbsp;1 song, \"[[All Over Me (Josh Turner song)|All Over Me]]\". It was followed by ''[[Punching Bag (album)|Punching Bag]]'' (2012), whose lead-off single, \"[[Time Is Love]]\", was the biggest country hit of 2012 according to [[Billboard Year-End]].\n\n==Early life==\nTurner was born in [[Hannah, South Carolina]]. Growing up in the church, he founded a gospel quartet called Thankful Hearts, where he sang [[Bass (voice type)|bass]],<ref name=allmusic/> in addition to singing the bass part in choirs.<ref name=\"Bass11\">{{cite web |first=Laura|last=Macmillan|title=11 of the Greatest and Most Famous Bass Singers of All Time|publisher=Hello Music Theory|date=3 June 2022 |url=https://hellomusictheory.com/learn/famous-bass-singers/}}</ref>\n\nIn 1996, Turner developed a lesion on his right vocal cord. Turner was examined by the [[Vanderbilt University|Vanderbilt]] voice clinic, where doctors advised him to let it heal on its own. Surgery was not needed, but he did have to rest his voice for a year. While Turner rested his voice back at home, he learned classical vocal technique and how to take care of his voice and avoid developing further problems. Turner states that he \"learned how to whistle really well during that year\".<ref name=\"cmt20\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/articles/1484630/01272004/turner_josh.jhtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040212163020/http://www.cmt.com/news/articles/1484630/01272004/turner_josh.jhtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 12, 2004 |title=20 Questions With Josh Turner |website=CMT.com |date=2004-01-27 |access-date=2016-09-30}}</ref>\n\nAfter Hannah-Pamplico High School, he spent some time at [[Francis Marion University]] before moving to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], to enroll in [[Belmont University]] and pursue a career in music. After college, his fledgling career got a boost on December 21, 2001, during his debut on the [[Grand Ole Opry]], when he performed a song he wrote titled \"[[Long Black Train (song)|Long Black Train]]\", which was inspired by [[Hank Williams]].<ref name=allmusic/> He received a standing ovation in the middle of the song, then sang it again for an encore.\n\n==Career==\n\n===2001–2004: ''Long Black Train''===\nOn December 21, 2001, Turner debuted on the [[Grand Ole Opry]] with the song \"[[Long Black Train (song)|Long Black Train]]\".\n\nIn 2003, Turner released his debut album, also entitled ''[[Long Black Train]]''. Prior to its release, Turner had released 7\" vinyl singles of \"She'll Go on You\" and \"Long Black Train\". Both singles featured ''Long Black Train'' album track \"Backwoods Boy\" as a B-side. While neither \"Backwoods Boy\" nor \"She'll Go on You\" were successful (the latter peaking at No.&nbsp;46 on the country charts), \"Long Black Train\" spent more than forty weeks on the ''Billboard'' country charts, reaching a peak of No.&nbsp;13 and receiving a gold certification. The third single, \"What It Ain't\", was less successful, reaching No.&nbsp;31.\n\n===2005–2006: ''Your Man''===\nIn early 2006, Turner released his second album, ''[[Your Man (album)|Your Man]]''. The album's first single and title track, \"[[Your Man (Josh Turner song)|Your Man]]\", was written by [[Jace Everett]], [[Chris DuBois]] and [[Chris Stapleton]] and released in late 2005. \"Your Man\" also climbed the charts slowly, eventually reaching No.&nbsp;1 in early 2006. ''Your Man'' was certified [[Music recording sales certification|Gold]] by the [[RIAA]] four weeks after its release, and went [[Music recording sales certification|Platinum]] six months later.<ref name=\"RIAASearch\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&artist=Josh%20Turner&startMonth=1&endMonth=1&startYear=1958&endYear=2008&sort=Artist&perPage=25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924153944/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&artist=Josh%20Turner&startMonth=1&endMonth=1&startYear=1958&endYear=2008&sort=Artist&perPage=25|url-status=dead|archive-date=2015-09-24|title=RIAA - Gold & Platinum Searchable Database - September 24, 2015| website=[[Recording Industry Association of America]] }}</ref>\n\n\"[[Would You Go with Me]]\" was the second single released from ''Your Man''. Like the album's title track, \"Would You Go with Me\" also reached the top of the country singles charts, holding that position for two weeks; it also reached No.&nbsp;48 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|'' Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Turner also performed it on the [[CMA Awards]] in November 2006.\n\nShortly after the album's release, a song called \"[[Me and God]]\" was released as a single to [[Christian radio]]. A duet with bluegrass musician [[Ralph Stanley]], the song also featured members of the band [[Diamond Rio]] on background vocals. \"Me and God\" reached a peak of No.&nbsp;16 on the country charts.\n\nIn December 2006, the 49th Annual [[Grammy Award]] nominations were announced. Turner received nods for [[Best Male Country Vocal Performance]] and for [[Best Country Album]]. That same month, a featurette on [[Country Music Television|CMT Insider]] showed Turner in the studio working on the album. He mentioned that he wanted it to sound like music in the 18th and 19th centuries. Turner performed at the Ryman Auditorium where a live album was recorded, singing a song called, \"Church in the Holler\". Turner's album ''Josh Turner: Live At The Ryman'' was recorded in April and is available exclusively through [[Cracker Barrel]] restaurants.\n\nTurner, along with veteran songwriters [[Brett James]] and [[Don Schlitz]], wrote a song entitled \"Say Yes\"; recorded and released by singer [[Dusty Drake]] in 2007, the song was a minor Top 40 country hit for Drake, peaking at No.&nbsp;36.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dustydrake.musiccitynetworks.com/index.htm?id%3D3683 |title=Dusty Drake |access-date=2007-04-11 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061123163315/http://dustydrake.musiccitynetworks.com/index.htm?id=3683 |archive-date=2006-11-23 }}</ref>\n\n===2007–2011: ''Everything Is Fine'' and ''Haywire''===\nOn September 29, 2007, while giving an award to [[Roy Clark]] on Clark's 20th anniversary on the Grand Ole Opry, Turner was invited to become a member of the Grand Ole Opry.
