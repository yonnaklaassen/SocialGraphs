The girls first learned to harmonize through singing [[a cappella]] at their hometown church.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Greenwald|first=Andy|title=Band of the Week: New Traditionalists, the Secret Sisters|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/band-of-the-week-new-traditionalists-the-secret-sisters-20101116|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=February 1, 2011}}</ref> Laura and Lydia never considered a singing career as a duo. Laura went to [[Middle Tennessee State University]] to pursue a career in business, while Lydia was considered the \"real\" singer of the family.\n\n===2010: Discovery and debut album===\nLaura traveled to [[Nashville, Tennessee]] for an impromptu audition at [[Hotel Indigo]] where music business record executive Andrew Brightman and producer [[Dave Cobb]] were present, looking to create a new singing group. Lydia could not attend the audition, so Laura traveled by herself, where she auditioned with \"Same Old You\" by [[Miranda Lambert]]. Representatives from the audition soon asked her to come back to Nashville, to which she asked if she could bring her sister Lydia along. Lydia showed up later and they were asked to sing together,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.countrycalifornia.com/quotable-country-112910-edition|title=Country California is being retired.|website=Countrycalifornia.com|accessdate=May 25, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180525204937/http://www.countrycalifornia.com/quotable-country-112910-edition|archive-date=May 25, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> resulting in the formation of the Secret Sisters. The girls were soon flown to Los Angeles for their first time in the studio to record a couple of demos.  For Laura, it was her first time in an airplane. The demos were produced and record companies began responding accordingly. Within weeks, they were assigned to [[Universal Republic Records]] and the song selection process for their debut album began.\n\nTheir [[The Secret Sisters (album)|self-titled debut album]] consists of cover songs such as \"Why Don't Ya Love Me?\", \"[[Why Baby Why]]\", the [[Frank Sinatra]] song \"[[Somethin' Stupid]]\", and [[Nancy Baron]]'s, \"I've Got a Feeling\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Allen|first=James|title=The Secret Sisters|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-secret-sisters-r1940135/review|accessdate=January 12, 2012|newspaper=All Music}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|last=Rowland|first=Stephen|title=The Secret Sisters: The Secret Sisters|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/132841-the-secret-sisters-the-secret-sisters|magazine=PopMatters|accessdate=January 12, 2012|date=November 8, 2010}}</ref> The album also includes two originals written by Laura Rogers: \"Tennessee Me\" and \"Waste the Day\".

The album was released October 12, 2010. Laura tried to describe the experience: \"In so many ways we are still the same kids who would perform songs in our parents' room, when we sang about silver threads and golden needles and cold-hearted snakes, and all that.
