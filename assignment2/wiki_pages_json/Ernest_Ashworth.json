Signed to the Hickory label, he recorded two studio albums in his career and charted several singles on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]], including the number one \"[[Talk Back Trembling Lips]]\" and seven other top ten hits.\n\n==Biography==\nBorn in [[Huntsville, Alabama]], United States,<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Country Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1993|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-726-6|page=24}}</ref> he began his career singing on Huntsville [[radio station]] [[WBHP]].<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> In 1950, he moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]],<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> where he worked for several radio stations and was signed by [[Wesley Rose]] as a [[songwriter]] for [[Acuff-Rose Music]]. Among the artists who recorded his songs between 1949 and 1955 were [[Jimmy Dickens]], [[Carl Smith (country musician)|Carl Smith]], [[Johnny Horton]], and [[Paul Anka]].\n\nSuccess as a recording artist eluded him, however, and in 1957 he returned to Huntsville and began working at the [[US Army]]'s [[Redstone Arsenal]], doing guided missile work.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> Three years later, Rose arranged a recording contract for him with [[Decca Records]].<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> Billed as Ernest Ashworth, his first single, \"Each Moment (Spent With You)\", became a Top Five hit.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> Later that year, \"You Can’t Pick A Rose In December\" went into the Top Ten; and in 1961, \"Forever Gone\" reached the Top 20.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/>\n\nIn 1962, Ashworth moved to [[Hickory Records]], owned by [[Roy Acuff|Acuff]]-[[Wesley Rose|Rose]], and he scored a Top Five hit with \"Everybody But Me\", and a Top Ten with \"[[I Take the Chance]]\".<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/>\n\nBut it was his third release for Hickory that became a smash hit and his signature song. \"Talk Back Trembling Lips\" hit number one,<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> and stayed on the national country chart for 42 weeks, and peaked at No.&nbsp;101 on the pop chart.\n\nVoted \"Most Promising Male Artist\" by ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]]'', ''[[Billboard Magazine|Billboard]]'', and ''[[Record World]]'' magazines in 1963 and 1964, he was invited to join the cast of the [[Grand Ole Opry]] in 1964.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> More chart records followed including \"The D.J. Cried\", \"At Ease Heart\", and \"I Love To Dance With Annie\".<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> Ashworth continued to be a regular performer at the Opry, but he never had a record to match the success of \"Talk Back Trembling Lips\".<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/>\n\nHe also owned a radio station in [[Flomaton, Alabama]], and, in 1989, he purchased radio station [[WSLV]] in [[Ardmore, Tennessee]]. In 1992, Ashworth was inducted into the [[Alabama Music Hall of Fame]]. Always a popular performer overseas, he had a number one song on the UK Independent Chart, \"Lonely Only Bar\", in 1999 and was also named the \"Number One Most Programmed Independent Artist in Europe\" that year.\n\nAshworth remained active as a recording artist until his death in 2009, making appearances at the Grand Ole Opry and spending much of his time tending to the affairs of his radio stations in Ardmore,  and also [[Gallatin, Tennessee]].\n\nErnie Ashworth died on March 2, 2009, in Nashville, Tennessee, at age 80.<ref name=\"Obits\">{{Cite web|url=https://obits.tennessean.com/us/obituaries/tennessean/name/ernest-ashworth-obituary?pid=124861350|title=Ernest Bert \"Ernie\" Ashworth Obituary (2009) The Tennessean|website=Legacy.com|access-date=August 4, 2021}}</ref> He had undergone bypass surgery prior to his death.\n\n==Discography==\n===Albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
