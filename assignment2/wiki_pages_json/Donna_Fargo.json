In 1975, she released ''Whatever I Say Means I Love You'' (ABC/MCA), her fifth and final album for the DOT label, that included \"What Will the New Year Bring?\"\n\nDot Records was acquired by [[ABC Records|ABC]] and there was a noticeable drop-off in chart placings for Fargo, and in 1976, she moved to [[Warner Bros. Records]].<ref name=\"Donna Fargo at\"/>\nFargo came out with the ''On the Move'' album, which spawned two Top 20 hits. The next year her next album, ''Fargo Country'' was released.

For the next few years, the successes came at a lower level.<ref name=\"Donna Fargo at\"/>\nAlthough this serious [[neurological disease|neurological illness]] caused a deep decline in her promotional work, Fargo vowed not to allow the disease ultimately to get to her. In 1979, she recorded a new album, ''Just for You,'' from which the biggest hit was the No. 14 hit \"Daddy\", a new version of a song that Fargo had recorded in 1969. The follow-up, \"Preacher Berry\", peaked outside the Country Top 40.\n\n===1980 – present: current music career===\nFargo released one more album with Warner Bros. in 1980 before switching to the smaller Songbird label in 1981.

After several other label changes, Fargo signed with [[Mercury Records|Mercury]], and began another upswing.<ref name=\"Donna Fargo at\"/> She recorded an album with the label, ''Winners,'' which resulted in three singles spawned from the album, including a Top 30 hit, \"Me and You\". Fargo also dueted with [[Billy Joe Royal]] for her next single, \"Members Only\". The song became a Top 25 country hit in 1987, peaking at No.&nbsp;23. In 1991, she released the song \"Soldier Boy\", a reference to the [[Gulf War]] which was going on at the time. The song was Fargo's last charting single. After several years without a full-length recording, in 1992, Fargo began work on her autobiography.<ref name=\"Donna Fargo at\"/> In 2008, Fargo released a new single CD, \"We Can Do Better in America\".
