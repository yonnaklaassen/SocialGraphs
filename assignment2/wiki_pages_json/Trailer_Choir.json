The trio was signed to [[Show Dog Nashville]], a label owned by [[Toby Keith]], in 2007. After recording the song \"Off the Hillbilly Hook\" for the [[soundtrack]] to Keith's film ''[[Beer for My Horses (film)|Beer for My Horses]]'', Trailer Choir charted the singles \"What Would You Say\", \"Rockin' the Beer Gut\" and \"Rollin' Through the Sunshine\" on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts. These singles were followed by an [[extended play]] called ''Off the Hillbilly Hook'' and an album called ''Tailgate''. Hoyt departed the group in February 2011. The remaining members took a small hiatus in 2012, but started touring again in 2013 before ending their career again in 2016.\n\n==Background==\nTrailer Choir was founded in 2004 by Marc Fortney, known as Butter, along with Vinny Hickerson and Crystal Hoyt, who are respectively known as Big Vinny and Crystal in the group.<ref>{{cite news |first=Carl E. |last=Feather |title=Making his bread as Butter |url=http://www.starbeacon.com/archivesearch/local_story_331174033.html |work=[[Star Beacon]] |date=2007-11-27 |accessdate=2009-10-14 }}</ref> Trailer Choir had originally started as a loose association of musicians, usually including Fortney and Hickerson, that played cover shows at fraternities and clubs in order to make some money and have some fun, rather than as an intended career path.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bio|url=http://www.jambase.com/Artists/53495/Trailer-Choir/Bio|work=Trailer Choir|publisher=JamBase.com|accessdate=7 April 2012}}</ref> Wanting to add original music without losing the audience led the group to writing and playing the party anthem style they are known for. They then started performing original shows during the week, while continuing to play the frat houses and clubs on the weekend.\n\nAt one performance in late 2006, a fan named Crystal Hoyt jumped on the stage and took over Hickerson's microphone, thus becoming a member of the band until she parted ways with them in early 2011.<ref>{{cite web|last=Stromblad|first=Cory|title=Trailer Choir Becomes Duo With Departure of Crystal Hoyt|url=http://www.theboot.com/2011/02/01/trailer-choir-crystal-hoyt-leaves/|work=The Boot|publisher=TheBoot.com|accessdate=7 April 2012|date=February 1, 2011}}</ref> Not long after Hoyt joined them, Toby Keith showed up at one of their original performances on \"The Billy Block Show\" at a club called 12th & Porter.
