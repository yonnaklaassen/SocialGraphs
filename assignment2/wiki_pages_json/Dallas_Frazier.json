We were the Okies who went out to California with mattresses tied on the tops of their Model A Fords. My folks were poor. At twelve I moved away from home, with my folks' permission. Ferlin [Husky] offered me a job, and I started working with him when I was twelve. Then I recorded a side for [[Capitol Records]] when I was fourteen, and I did some country. I cut in the big circular building that's still out there on Hollywood and Vine.\"\n\nFrazier's 1957 song \"[[Alley Oop (song)|Alley Oop]]\", later taken to No. 1 in the US by [[The Hollywood Argyles]], was his first hit.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> After ''Hometown Jamboree'' went off the air, Frazier moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], and found work as a songwriter. Among his early successes was \"Timber I'm Falling\", a hit for Husky in 1964, and \"[[There Goes My Everything (song)|There Goes My Everything]]\", a big hit for [[Jack Greene]] in 1966,<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> that earned him a nomination for the [[Grammy Award for Best Country Song]].\n\nIn 1966, he released his solo debut album ''Elvira'', containing his song \"[[Elvira (song)|Elvira]]\". His follow-up, ''Tell It Like It Is'' (1967), was also a success.<ref name=allmusic/>\n\nWhile his singing success was limited, Frazier became an oft-covered songwriter.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> His tunes were recorded by [[O.C. Smith]], [[George Jones]] (who recorded [[Sings the Songs of Dallas Frazier|an entire album]] of Frazier's songs in 1968), [[Diana Ross]], [[Engelbert Humperdinck (singer)|Engelbert Humperdinck]], [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], [[Jack Greene]], [[Connie Smith]] (who also recorded an [[If It Ain't Love and Other Great Dallas Frazier Songs|entire album]] of Frazier's songs in 1972), [[Willie Nelson]], [[Brenda Lee]], [[Carola Standertskjöld|Carola]], [[Charley Pride]], [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Merle Haggard]], [[Gene Watson]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Moe Bandy]], [[Roy Head]], [[Charlie Louvin]], [[Rodney Crowell]], [[Dan McCafferty]], [[Poco]] and [[Ronnie Hawkins]]. In 1970, Frazier earned his second [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Country Song|Best Country Song]], which is awarded to the songwriter rather than the performer, for \"[[All I Have to Offer You (Is Me)]], which became a No. 1 hit for [[Charley Pride]]. Many of the songs became hits into the 1980s; examples include the [[Oak Ridge Boys]] cover of \"[[Elvira (song)|Elvira]]\" and [[Emmylou Harris]]'s version of \"Beneath Still Waters\".<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> The cover of \"Elvira\" by the Oak Ridge Boys was a crossover hit, peaking at No. 1 on Billboard's [[Hot Country Songs|Hot Country Singles and Tracks]] chart and No. 5 on the all genre [[Billboard Hot 100]]; and earned Frazier his third Grammy nomination for Best Country song. [[Anne Murray]] with [[Glen Campbell]], [[George Strait]], [[Randy Travis]], and [[Patty Loveless]] have all also recorded Frazier tunes.<ref name=allmusic/> Frazier himself charted eight times on the U.S. country chart.
