He has released 29 studio albums and three as a former member of [[Whiskeytown]].\n\nIn 2000, Adams left Whiskeytown and released his debut solo album, ''[[Heartbreaker (Ryan Adams album)|Heartbreaker]]'', to critical acclaim. The album was nominated for the [[Shortlist Music Prize]]. The following year, his profile increased with the release of the UK certified-gold ''[[Gold (Ryan Adams album)|Gold]]'', which included the single \"[[New York, New York (Ryan Adams song)|New York, New York]]\". During this time, Adams worked on several unreleased albums, which were consolidated into a third solo release, ''[[Demolition (Ryan Adams album)|Demolition]]'' (2002). Working at a prolific rate, Adams released the [[rock (album)|classic rock]]-influenced ''[[Rock n Roll (Ryan Adams album)|Rock N Roll]]'' (2003), after a planned album, ''[[Love Is Hell (Ryan Adams album)|Love Is Hell]]'', was rejected by his label [[Lost Highway Records|Lost Highway]]. As a compromise, ''Love Is Hell'' was released as two EPs and eventually released in its full-length state in 2004.\n\nAfter breaking his wrist during a live performance, Ryan Adams took a hiatus and formed a backing band called [[Ryan Adams & the Cardinals|The Cardinals]], who supported him on his next four studio albums. In 2009, due to complications from [[Ménière's disease]], Adams disbanded The Cardinals and took a break from music.<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Daniel|last=Kreps|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/ryan-adams-announces-split-from-the-cardinals-hiatus-20090114 |title=Ryan Adams announces split from the cardinals, hiatus|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=January 14, 2009}}</ref> However, he returned to the music scene in 2010, releasing his 13th studio album, ''[[Ashes & Fire]]''. Adams continued his musical journey by releasing his 14th album, ''[[Ryan Adams (album)|Ryan Adams]]'' in 2014.\n\nIn 2015, Adams gained attention for his cover album ''[[1989 (Ryan Adams album)|1989]]'', a song-for-song cover of [[Taylor Swift|Taylor Swift's]] album of the same name. In 2019, several women accused Adams of sexual harassment, leading to a delay in the release of three planned albums. Adams later issued an apology and eventually released six  more albums between 2020 and 2022. In addition to his own material, Adams has also produced albums for [[Willie Nelson]], [[Jesse Malin]], [[Jenny Lewis]], and [[Fall Out Boy]], and has collaborated with [[Counting Crows]], [[Weezer]], [[Norah Jones]], [[America (band)|America]], [[Minnie Driver]], [[Cowboy Junkies]], [[Leona Naess]], [[Toots and the Maytals]], [[Beth Orton]] and [[Krista Polvere]]. He has written ''[[Infinity Blues]]'', a book of poems, and ''[[Hello Sunshine (book)|Hello Sunshine]]'', a collection of poems and short stories.\n\n==Early life==\nDavid Ryan Adams was born on November 5, 1974, in [[Jacksonville, North Carolina]].<ref name=allmusicbio>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/ryan-adams-mn0000808336/biography|title=Ryan Adams Biography |first= Mark |last=Deming|access-date= February 14, 2019|website=[[AllMusic.com]]}}</ref> He is the middle of three children with an older brother and younger sister.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/bobmehr/at-home-kinda-with-ryan-adams|title=Ryan Adams Finally Finds His Way Home|first=Bob |last=Mehr|work=[[BuzzFeed]]|date=September 7, 2014|access-date=November 28, 2014}}</ref> His childhood has been described as \"dysfunctional\".

In his own words, \"I started writing short stories when I was really into [[Edgar Allan Poe]]. Then later, when I was a teenager, I got really hard into cult fiction: [[Hubert Selby, Jr.]], [[Henry Miller]], [[Jack Kerouac]].\" At 14, Adams began learning to play an electric guitar his mother and stepfather had bought him and soon joined a local band named Blank Label.

Whiskeytown saw Adams move to [[Alternative country|alt-country]], describing [[punk rock]] as \"too hard to sing\" in the title track of Whiskeytown's debut album ''[[Faithless Street]]''. Whiskeytown was heavily influenced by a number of country-rock pioneers, most notably [[Gram Parsons]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Inman |first1=Davis |title=Pieces Of The Sky: The Legacy Of Gram Parsons |url=https://americansongwriter.com/pieces-of-the-sky-the-legacy-of-gram-parsons/?nab=1 |website=American Songwriter|date=May 18, 2012 }}</ref> The band quickly gained critical acclaim with the release of their second full-length album, ''[[Strangers Almanac]]'', their first [[Record label|major label]] release. A third album, ''[[Pneumonia (album)|Pneumonia]],'' was completed in 1999, but record label problems delayed its release. It was eventually released by [[Lost Highway Records|Lost Highway]] in 2001, at which time the band was effectively done.\n\n===Solo career (2000–2004)===\nAdams made his solo debut in 2000, with ''[[Heartbreaker (Ryan Adams album)|Heartbreaker]]'' (produced by [[Ethan Johns]]).<ref>[https://archive.today/20120712133705/http://exclaim.ca/articles/multiarticlesub.aspx?csid1=112&csid2=4&fid1=26076 'Ryan Adams Grows Up'].

It was well received. Adams, however, initially refused to promote the record through radio station meet-and-greets and other music-industry conventions, instead opting for more recording and some live dates.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}} A video was eventually made for the album's first single, \"[[New York, New York (Ryan Adams song)|New York, New York]]\". The music video featured Adams performing in front of the city's skyline four days before the [[September 11 attacks]]. The video was played often on [[MTV]] and [[VH1]] after the attacks and became Adams's breakthrough to mainstream music consumers.\n\nFollowing the success of ''Gold'', in 2002 Adams was blocked by his label from releasing his choice for a follow-up album. This would be the second time, the first being with ''Gold;'' Adams had recorded \"the Suicide Handbook\" which was rejected on the grounds that it was \"too sad\". The label opted this time around to cherry pick (without Adams' involvement) from four of Adams' recorded albums it had already dismissed as unreleasable (48 Hours, The Suicide Handbook, The Pinkhearts and The Swedish Sessions) to create ''[[Demolition (Ryan Adams album)|Demolition]],'' released in September 2002. Although the album garnered him more critical attention, it failed to sell as well as ''Gold''. The same year, Adams produced [[Jesse Malin]]'s first album, ''[[The Fine Art of Self Destruction]]'', and later worked with Malin to form the punk-rock group [[The Finger (band)|The Finger]] (under the pseudonyms, \"Warren Peace\" and \"Irving Plaza\" respectively), who released two E.P.s which were collected together to form ''[[We Are Fuck You]]'', released on [[One Little Indian Records]] in 2003. He also starred in a [[Gap (clothing retailer)|Gap]] advertisement with Willie Nelson, performing a cover of Hank Williams's \"[[Move It On Over (song)|Move It on Over]]\".\n\nIn May 2002, Adams joined Elton John on ''[[CMT Crossroads]]'',<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cmt.com/shows/dyn/cmt_crossroads/59823/episode.jhtml | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040202201350/http://www.cmt.com/shows/dyn/cmt_crossroads/59823/episode.jhtml | url-status=dead | archive-date=February 2, 2004 | title=CMT Crossroads: Elton John and Ryan Adams | access-date=April 11, 2007 | publisher = [[Country Music Television]]}}</ref> which brings together country artists with musicians from other genres. During the show, John referred to Adams as \"fabulous one\" and spoke of how ''Heartbreaker'' inspired him to record ''[[Songs from the West Coast]]'', which at the time was his most successful album in several years. Also in 2002, Adams reportedly recorded a cover of [[The Strokes]]' debut album ''[[Is This It]]'', though it has never been publicly released.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nme.com/news/ryan-adams/11149 | title=Adams Different Strokes in Demand! | access-date=April 11, 2007 | date=April 3, 2002 | publisher = [[NME]]/[[IPC Media]]}}</ref>\n\nIn 2002 and 2003, Adams worked on recording ''[[Love Is Hell (Ryan Adams album)|Love Is Hell]]'', intending to release it in 2003. [[Lost Highway Records]] deemed that it was not commercially viable and was reluctant to release it, leading Adams to go back to the studio. Two weeks later he returned to Lost Highway with ''[[Rock n Roll (Ryan Adams album)|Rock n Roll]]'', which featured guest musicians including [[Melissa Auf der Maur]], [[Green Day]]'s [[Billie Joe Armstrong]], and Adams's girlfriend at the time, [[Parker Posey]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Smith |first1=RJ |title=Ryan Adams, 'Rock N Roll' (Lost Highway) |url=https://www.spin.com/2003/11/ryan-adams-rock-n-roll-lost-highway/ |website=SPIN |date=November 11, 2003 |access-date=August 3, 2020}}</ref>  Adams' songwriting received additional exposure when [[Joan Baez]] included his song \"In My Time of Need\", from his debut release, on her 2003 album ''[[Dark Chords on a Big Guitar]].''\n\nAlso released in 2003, Adams formed a punk band called The Finger with [[Jesse Malin]], Colin Burns, and Johnny T. Yerington.<sup>[[The Finger (band)#cite note-1|[1]]]</sup> The name derived from notorious early/mid-1990s [[Raleigh, North Carolina]] rock band Finger, of which Adams was a big fan. This light-hearted project allowed both artists to return to their punk backgrounds (Adams began his music career as singer for The Patty Duke Syndrome and Malin began his career in the hardcore punk band [[Heart Attack (band)|Heart Attack]] and more famously as the lead singer of [[D Generation]]). They began by releasing two EPs: ''We Are Fuck You'' and ''Punk's Dead Let's Fuck'' which were later collected to form the album ''[[We Are Fuck You]]'' that was released in 2003.\n\nAdams and Lost Highway Records eventually agreed that the label would release ''[[Rock n Roll (Ryan Adams album)|Rock N Roll]]'' as well as ''Love Is Hell'', on the condition that ''Love Is Hell'' be split into two EP installments. ''Rock N Roll'' and ''Love Is Hell, Pt. 1'' were released in November 2003, followed by ''Love Is Hell, Pt. 2'' in December. Both albums were well received by critics, and in May 2004 ''Love Is Hell'' was re-released as a full-length album.\n\n''Love Is Hell'' included a cover of [[Oasis (band)|Oasis']] \"[[Wonderwall (song)|Wonderwall]]\", which Adams had previously performed live, and about which [[Noel Gallagher]] once said, \"I never got my head round this song until I went to [see] Ryan Adams play and he did an amazing cover of it.\"<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nme.com/news/oasis/12909 | title = The 'Wonder' of Ryan | access-date=April 11, 2007| date=October 31, 2002 | publisher = [[NME]]/[[IPC Media]]}}</ref> The song earned Adams a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] nomination for \"[[Grammy Award for Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance|Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance]]\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/entertainment/2002112383_grammys08.html |title=Kanye West is at top of Grammy list |access-date=August 15, 2012 |date=December 8, 2004 |publisher=[[The Seattle Times Company]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629020925/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/entertainment/2002112383_grammys08.html |archive-date=June 29, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nWhile on tour to support ''Love Is Hell'' in January 2004, Adams fractured his wrist during a performance at the [[Royal Court Theatre, Liverpool|Royal Court Theatre]] in Liverpool.

The two performed [[Jerry Garcia]] and [[Robert Hunter (lyricist)|Robert Hunter]]'s Grateful Dead classic, \"Wharf Rat\". Adams performed at subsequent outings of [[Phil Lesh and Friends]], including a two-night stand at [[Red Rocks Amphitheatre]] outside of [[Denver]], Colorado and on New Year's Eve 2005 at the Bill Graham Event Center in San Francisco. Throughout 2006, Lesh's live performances included compositions by Adams, including several from ''Cold Roses'' (\"Cold Roses\", \"Let It Ride\", and \"Magnolia Mountain\").\n\nAdams produced [[Willie Nelson]]'s album ''[[Songbird (Willie Nelson album)|Songbird]]'', while he and The Cardinals performed as Nelson's backing band.  The album was released in October 2006.  He also opened for Nelson at the [[Hollywood Bowl]] later that fall, a show that featured [[Phil Lesh]] on bass and multiple [[Grateful Dead]] songs.  Late in 2006, Adams experimented with [[hip hop music]], adding to his web site 18 albums worth of new recordings under various pseudonyms, featuring humorous and nonsensical lyrics, as well as covers of two [[Bob Dylan]] songs (\"[[Isis (song)|Isis]]\" and \"[[You're a Big Girl Now]]\").\n\nAdams released his ninth album on June 26, 2007, titled ''[[Easy Tiger]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://main.losthighwayrecords.com/news.aspx?bid=1795 | title = Easy tiger | date = March 30, 2007 | access-date = April 11, 2007 | publisher = [[Lost Highway Records]] |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927212352/http://main.losthighwayrecords.com/news.aspx?bid=1795 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = September 27, 2007}}</ref> The album includes many tracks which were debuted during 2006's tours, as well as other older tracks which were previously unreleased.\n\nOn October 23, 2007, Adams released ''[[Follow the Lights]]'', an EP featuring three new songs: \"Follow the Lights\",\"Blue Hotel\" and \"My Love for You Is Real\", along with live studio versions of other previously released songs and a cover of Alice in Chains' \"Down In A Hole\".<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.nme.com/news/ryan-adams/31208 | title = Ryan Adams reveals details of new EP | publisher = [[NME]]/[[IPC Media]] | date=September 18, 2007 | access-date=September 21, 2007}}</ref> Adams also appeared as a guest musician on Cowboy Junkies' 2007 album and DVD ''[[Trinity Revisited]]'', a 20th-anniversary re-recording of their classic album ''[[The Trinity Session]]''.
