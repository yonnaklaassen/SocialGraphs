The group is composed of [[Hillary Scott]] (lead and background vocals), [[Charles Kelley]] (lead and background vocals, guitar), and [[Dave Haywood]] (lead and background vocals, guitar, piano, mandolin). Scott is the daughter of country music singer [[Linda Davis]], and Kelley is the brother of pop singer [[Josh Kelley]]. The band abbreviated the name to \"Lady A\" in June 2020 during the [[George Floyd protests]] in an attempt to blunt the name's associations with [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and the [[Antebellum South]], inadvertently causing a dispute with Black blues and gospel singer [[Anita White]], who had been using the name Lady A for more than 20 years.\n\nThe group made its debut in 2007 as guest vocalists on [[Jim Brickman]]'s single \"[[Never Alone (Jim Brickman song)|Never Alone]]\", before signing to [[Capitol Records Nashville|Capitol Nashville]]. Lady A has released six albums for Capitol: ''[[Lady Antebellum (album)|Lady Antebellum]]'', ''[[Need You Now (Lady Antebellum album)|Need You Now]]'', ''[[Own the Night]]'', ''[[Golden (Lady Antebellum album)|Golden]]'', ''[[747 (album)|747]]'', ''[[Heart Break (Lady Antebellum album)|Heart Break]]'', plus one Christmas album (''[[On This Winter's Night]]''), and one for [[Nashville Harbor Records & Entertainment]]: ''[[Ocean (Lady Antebellum album)|Ocean]]''. The first three albums are [[RIAA certification|certified platinum]] or higher by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). The albums have produced sixteen singles on the [[Hot Country Songs]] and [[Country Airplay]] charts, of which nine have reached number one. The longest-lasting number one single is \"[[Need You Now (Lady Antebellum song)|Need You Now]]\", which spent five weeks at that position in 2009; both that song and 2011's \"[[Just a Kiss (song)|Just a Kiss]]\" reached number one on the [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary charts]].\n\nLady A was awarded Top New Duo or Group by the [[Academy of Country Music]] and New Artist of the Year by the [[Country Music Association]] in 2008. The band was nominated for two Grammy Awards at the [[51st Annual Grammy Awards]] and two more at the [[52nd Annual Grammy Awards]], winning Best Country Performance by Duo or Group with Vocals for \"I Run to You\". It was awarded Top Vocal Group, Song of the Year (\"Need You Now\"), and Single of the Year (\"Need You Now\") at the 44th [[ACM Awards]] on April 18, 2010.

Interviewed by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', White described the band's token acknowledgement of racism while blithely appropriating an African American artist's name: \"They're using the name because of a [[Black Lives Matter]] incident that, for them, is just a moment in time. If it mattered, it would have mattered to them before. It shouldn't have taken [[Murder of George Floyd|George Floyd to die]] for them to realize that their name had a slave reference to it.
