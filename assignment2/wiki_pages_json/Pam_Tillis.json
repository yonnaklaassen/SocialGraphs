She is the eldest child of country singer [[Mel Tillis]]. After recording unsuccessful pop material for [[Elektra Records|Elektra]] and [[Warner Records]] in the early 1980s, Tillis shifted to country music. In 1989, she signed with [[Arista Nashville]], entering top-40 on [[Hot Country Songs]] for the first time with \"[[Don't Tell Me What to Do]]\" in 1990. This was the first of five singles from her breakthrough album ''[[Put Yourself in My Place (album)|Put Yourself in My Place]]''. \n\nTillis recorded five more albums for Arista Nashville in the next ten years, including a [[greatest hits]] album. She charted twelve top-ten hits on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country music charts with Arista, including the number-one \"[[Mi Vida Loca (My Crazy Life)]]\" in 1995. Other major hits of hers include her [[signature song]] \"[[Maybe It Was Memphis]]\", along with \"[[Shake the Sugar Tree]]\", \"[[Spilled Perfume]]\", a cover of [[Jackie DeShannon]]'s \"[[When You Walk in the Room]]\", and \"[[All the Good Ones Are Gone]]\". After exiting Arista, Tillis released ''[[It's All Relative: Tillis Sings Tillis]]'' for Lucky Dog Records in 2002, and ''[[RhineStoned]]'' and the Christmas album ''[[Just in Time for Christmas]]'' on her own Stellar Cat label in 2007. Her albums ''[[Homeward Looking Angel]]'' (1992), ''[[Sweetheart's Dance]]'' (1994), and ''[[Greatest Hits (Pam Tillis album)|Greatest Hits]]'' (1997) are all [[music recording sales certification|certified platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]], while ''Put Yourself in My Place'' and 1995's ''[[All of This Love]]'' are certified gold.\n\nShe has won two major awards: a [[Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals]] in 1999 for the multiple-artist collaboration \"Same Old Train\", and the 1994 [[Country Music Association]] award for [[Country Music Association Award for Female Vocalist of the Year|Female Vocalist of the Year]]. In 2000, she was inducted into the [[Grand Ole Opry]]. In addition to her own work, Tillis has written songs for [[Barbara Fairchild]], [[Juice Newton]], and [[Highway 101]], among others.
