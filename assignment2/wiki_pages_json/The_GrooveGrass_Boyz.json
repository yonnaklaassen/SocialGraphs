The group was founded as a side project by record producer and session musician Scott Rouse in 1987, after he began experimenting with dance mixes of bluegrass and country songs, eventually applying the term groovegrass to his mix of music. He then moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], and joined several other country musicians and funk bass guitarist [[Bootsy Collins]], releasing a country version of [[Los del Río]]'s \"[[Macarena]]\" and two albums. The country cover of \"Macarena\" charted on both the [[Hot Country Songs]] charts and the [[Bubbling Under Hot 100]], and was the group's only chart entry.\n\n==History==\nRouse, a [[session musician]] from [[Boston, Massachusetts]], first came up with the idea of GrooveGrass in the mid-1980s when he began experimenting with dance mixes of bluegrass songs such as [[Alton Delmore]]'s \"Deep River Blues\". His mixes became popular at local clubs, eventually leading to one disc jockey terming the blend of music \"groovegrass\".<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p350665/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=GrooveGrass biography |accessdate=2008-08-21 |last=Ankeny |first=Jason |publisher=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref>\n\nRouse then moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], at the request of his friend, musician [[Doc Watson]]. Rouse's first country remix was for [[Warner Bros. Records|Warner Bros.]] It was a remix of [[John Anderson (musician)|John Anderson]]'s 1983 Number One single \"[[Swingin' (John Anderson song)|Swingin']].\" At Anderson's request, Warner never released the cut, although it became a popular [[bootleg recording]].<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> It was followed by an [[Extended play|EP]] remix of \"[[Rocky Top]]\", which was released and went on to sell more than 100,000 copies in the United States.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> Rouse also produced comedian [[Jeff Foxworthy]]'s trademark \"You might be a redneck if…\" single he named called the \"Redneck Stomp\",<ref name=\"bb\"/> one of several similar musical tracks included on Foxworthy's ''[[Crank It Up: The Music Album]]''.\n\nSoon afterward, Rouse recruited several other musicians, including members of [[Del McCoury]]'s band, funk bass guitarist [[Bootsy Collins]], and bluegrass multi-instrumentalist [[Jerry Douglas]], to perform as the GrooveGrass Boyz.<ref name=\"news\">{{cite web |url=http://www.musiciansnews.com/mastering/18/nashville_producer_scott_rouse_mixing_groovegrass_with_the_u.shtml |title=Nashville producer Scott Rouse Mixing GrooveGrass with the UAD-1 |accessdate=2008-08-21 |work=Musicians' News}}</ref> They saw their most successful release in late 1996, when they put out a country version of the \"[[Macarena (song)|Macarena]]\", a song made popular earlier that year by Spanish duo [[Los del Río]].<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> The GrooveGrass Boyz' version, released on [[Imprint Records]],<ref name=\"bb\">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.allbusiness.com/retail-trade/miscellaneous-retail-retail-stores-not/4626736-1.html |title=Groovegrass' Scott Rouse Weds Unlikely Pair Of Bluegrass, R&B |accessdate=2008-08-21 |last=Bessman |first=Jim |date=1999-01-09 |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}</ref> peaked at No.&nbsp;70 on the [[Hot Country Songs]] charts and No.&nbsp;7 on the [[Bubbling Under Hot 100]].
