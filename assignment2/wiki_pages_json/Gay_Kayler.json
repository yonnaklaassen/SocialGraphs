Gay used her maiden name in her professional career until 1978, when she changed the spelling from Kahler to Kayler to maintain a consistency of pronunciation. She retired in 1998.\n\n==Early life==\nGay Kayler comes from a musical family. Her mother sang and played piano, piano accordion and violin with her siblings in their father's dance band on the [[Darling Downs]], Queensland, in the 1930s.<ref>Gay Gets Around, ''The Australian Women's Weekly'', 14 November 1962</ref>\n\nIn 1942, the Kayler family moved to Sydney, where Gay continued this musical tradition when, at the age of two-and-a-half, she captivated commuters on Sydney's trams and buses as she sang for them.<ref>Gay Kahler: Her 'gimmick' is that she can sing, ''The Secretaries and Managers Journal'', May 1973</ref>\n\nIn the early 1950s, Gay sang on one of the first reel-to-reel tape recorders in Australia – as part of its demonstration at the [[Sydney Royal Easter Show]].\n\nAfter attaining her certificate for 7th Grade Piano, Theory and Musical Perception, Gay and her family moved to [[Toowoomba, Queensland]]. It was there that Gay made her first professional performance in 1958.\n\nGay Kayler's reputation blossomed when she was chosen to sing the Alexandra Waltz for [[Princess Alexandra, The Honourable Lady Ogilvy|Princess Alexandra]] during her 1959 visit to Australia.<ref>Gay song for a princess, ''Woman's Day'', 7 January 1963</ref> The Fairy Princess wanted to hear more so, by royal command, the teenager sang a selection of songs.
