Said [[Toby Keith]] regarding his signing of the band: \"As soon as I got the CD I put it on and was hooked. Right then I knew I had to see if Flynnville Train were as good performing live as they are on the disc. They were more than I could have expected and I signed them on the spot. You will hear great things from this band.\"<ref>[http://www.flynnvilletrain.com/band.htm Flynnville Train - Band<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Their self-titled debut album was released on September 11, 2007.
