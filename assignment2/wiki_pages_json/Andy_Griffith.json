He gained prominence in the starring role in director [[Elia Kazan]]'s film ''[[A Face in the Crowd (film)|A Face in the Crowd]]'' (1957) and ''[[No Time for Sergeants (film)|No Time for Sergeants]]'' (1958) before he became better known for his television roles, playing the lead roles of [[Andy Taylor (The Andy Griffith Show)|Andy Taylor]] in the sitcom ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'' (1960–1968) and [[Ben Matlock]] in the [[legal drama]] ''[[Matlock (TV series)|Matlock]]'' (1986–1995).\n\n==Early life and education==\nGriffith was born on June 1, 1926 in [[Mount Airy, North Carolina]], the only child of Carl Lee Griffith and his wife, Geneva (née Nunn).<ref>{{cite book | last1=Robinson | first1=D. | last2=Fernandes | first2=D. | title=The Definitive Andy Griffith Show Reference: Episode-by-Episode, with Cast and Production Biographies and a Guide to Collectibles | publisher=McFarland, Incorporated, Publishers | year=2012 | isbn=978-1-4766-0187-8 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tcr6UMkvVPwC&pg=PT381 | access-date=September 29, 2021 | page=381}}</ref> As a baby, Griffith lived with relatives until his parents could afford to buy a home. With neither a crib nor a bed, he slept in dresser drawers for several months. In 1929, when Griffith was three, his father began working as a helper or carpenter and purchased a home in Mount Airy's \"[[Blue-collar worker|blue-collar]]\" south side. Griffith grew up listening to music. By the time he entered school, he was well aware that he was from what many considered the \"wrong side of the tracks\". He was a shy student, but once he found a way to make his peers laugh, he began to come out of his shell and come into his own.\n\nAs a student at [[Mount Airy High School]], Griffith cultivated an interest in the arts, and he participated in the school's drama program. A growing love of music, particularly [[swing music|swing]], would change his life.

He performed as a cast member of the play for several years, playing a variety of roles until he finally landed the role of [[Walter Raleigh|Sir Walter Raleigh]], for whom North Carolina's capital is named.\n\nHe attended the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]] (UNC) in [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina]], and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Music]] [[academic degree|degree]] in 1949.

That was the first of two appearances on that series. In 1960, Griffith appeared as a [[County (United States)|county]] [[sheriff]], who was also a [[justice of the peace]] and the [[copy editing|editor]] of the local newspaper, in an episode of ''[[Make Room for Daddy]]'' starring [[Danny Thomas]]. This episode, in which Thomas's character is stopped for running a stop sign in a little town, served as a [[backdoor pilot]] for ''The Andy Griffith Show''. Both shows were produced by [[Sheldon Leonard]].\n\n====''The Andy Griffith Show'' (1960–1968)====\n[[File:Andy Griffith Julie Adams Andy Griffith Show 1962.JPG|thumb|left|Andy Griffith and [[Julie Adams]] in 1962]]\nBeginning in September 1960, Griffith starred as [[Andy Taylor (The Andy Griffith Show)|Sheriff Andy Taylor]] in ''The Andy Griffith Show'' for the [[CBS#Television years: expansion and growth|CBS television network]]. The show took place in the fictional town of [[Mayberry]], North Carolina, where Taylor, a widower, was the sheriff and town sage. The show was filmed at Desilu Studios, with exteriors filmed at [[RKO Forty Acres|Forty Acres]] in [[Culver City, California]].\n\nFrom 1960 to 1965, the show co-starred [[character actor]] and comedian&nbsp;— and Griffith's longtime friend&nbsp;— Don Knotts in the role of [[Deputy sheriff|Deputy]] [[Barney Fife]], Taylor's best friend and comedy partner. He was also Taylor's cousin in the show at first, though later they dropped that cousin relationship and talked simply of knowing one another since boyhood. In the series premiere episode, in a conversation between the two, Fife calls Taylor \"Cousin Andy\", and Taylor calls Fife \"Cousin Barney\". The show also starred child actor [[Ron Howard]] (then known as Ronny Howard), who played Taylor's only child, Opie Taylor. It was an immediate hit. Griffith never received a writing credit for the show, but he worked on the development of every script. Knotts was frequently lauded and won multiple [[Emmy Award]]s for his comedic performances, as did [[Frances Bavier]] in 1967, while Griffith was never nominated for an Emmy Award during the show's run.\n\n[[File:Andy Griffith Lee Meriwether 1971.JPG|thumb|right|Publicity photo with [[Lee Meriwether]] for ''[[The New Andy Griffith Show]]'', 1971]]\nIn 1967, Griffith was under contract with CBS to do one more season of the show. However, he decided to quit the show to pursue a movie career and other projects. The series continued as ''[[Mayberry R.F.D.]]'', with [[Ken Berry]] starring as a widower farmer and many of the regular characters recurring, some regularly and some as guest appearances. Griffith served as executive producer (according to Griffith, he came in once a week to review the week's scripts and give input) and guest starred in five episodes (the pilot episode involved his marriage to [[Helen Crump]]).<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062587/fullcredits \"Full Cast and Crew for ''Mayberry R.F.D.''].

After spending seven months in rehabilitation for leg [[paralysis]] from [[Guillain–Barré syndrome]] in 1983, Griffith returned to television as the title character, Ben Matlock, in the legal drama ''Matlock'' (1986–1995) on NBC and ABC. Matlock was a [[country lawyer]] in [[Atlanta]], Georgia, who was known for his [[Southern American English|Southern drawl]] and for always winning his cases. ''Matlock'' also starred unfamiliar, struggling actors (both of whom were childhood fans of Andy Griffith) [[Nancy Stafford]] as Michelle Thomas (1987–1992) and [[Clarence Gilyard]], Jr. as Conrad McMasters (1989–1993). By the end of its first season it was a ratings powerhouse on Tuesday nights. Although the show was nominated for four Emmy Awards, Griffith once again was never nominated. He did, however, win a People's Choice Award in 1987 for his work as Matlock.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.peopleschoice.com/pca/awards/nominees/index.jsp?year=1987 |title=People's Choice Awards 1987 |access-date=August 1, 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Other television appearances====\nGriffith also made other character appearances through the years on ''[[Playhouse 90]]'', ''[[Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.]]'', ''[[The Mod Squad]]'', ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'', ''[[The Doris Day Show]]'', ''[[Here's Lucy]]'', ''[[The Bionic Woman]]'' and ''[[Fantasy Island]]'', among many others. He also reprised his role as Ben Matlock on ''[[Diagnosis: Murder]]'' in 1997, and his final guest-starring role was in 2001 in an episode of ''[[Dawson's Creek]]''.\n\n===Films (including television films)===\n[[File:A Face in the Crowd publicity photo (Patricia Neal & Andy Griffith).jpg|thumb|right|[[Patricia Neal]] and Griffith in ''[[A Face in the Crowd (film)|A Face in the Crowd]]'' (1957)]]\nFor most of the 1970s, Griffith starred or appeared in many television films, including ''[[The Strangers in 7A]]'' (1972), ''[[Go Ask Alice]]'' (1973), ''[[Winter Kill]]'' (1974) and ''[[Pray for the Wildcats]]'' (1974), which marked his first villainous role since ''A Face in the Crowd''. Griffith appeared again as a villain in ''[[Savages (1974 film)|Savages]]'' (1974), a television film based on the novel ''[[Deathwatch (book)|Deathwatch]]'' (1972) by [[Robb White]]. He appeared as The Father in a 1976 PBS television adaptation, directed by [[Stacy Keach]], of [[Luigi Pirandello]]'s ''[[Six Characters in Search of an Author]]''. Griffith received his only [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nomination as [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor – Miniseries or a Movie|Outstanding Supporting Actor – Miniseries or a Movie]] for his role as the father of a murder victim in the television film ''[[Murder in Texas (film)|Murder in Texas]]'' (1981) and won further acclaim for his role as a [[homicide|homicidal]] [[villain]] in the television film ''[[Murder in Coweta County]]'' (1983), co-starring music legend [[Johnny Cash]] as the sheriff. He also appeared in several [[miniseries|television miniseries]], including the television version of ''[[From Here to Eternity (TV series)|From Here to Eternity]]'' (1979), ''[[Roots: The Next Generations]]'' (1979), ''[[Centennial (miniseries)|Centennial]]'' (1978), and the [[Watergate scandal]]-inspired ''[[Washington: Behind Closed Doors]]'' (1977), playing a former president loosely based on [[Lyndon B. Johnson]].\n\nMost of the television movies in which Griffith starred were also attempts to launch a new series. ''[[Winter Kill]]'' (1974) launched the short-lived ''[[Adams of Eagle Lake]]'', which was canceled in 1975 after only two episodes. A year later, he starred as a New York City attorney for the DA's office in ''Street Killing'', which also failed to launch a new show. Two television films for NBC in 1977, ''The Girl in the Empty Grave'' and ''Deadly Game'', were attempts for Griffith to launch a new series featuring him as Police Chief Abel Marsh, a more hard-edged version of Andy Taylor; despite strong ratings, both were unsuccessful in leading to a new TV show.\n\nDuring this period, Griffith also appeared in two feature films, both of which flopped at the box office. He co-starred with [[Jeff Bridges]] as a crusty old 1930s western actor in the comedy ''[[Hearts of the West (1975 film)|Hearts of the West]]'' (1975), and he appeared alongside [[Tom Berenger]] as a gay villainous [[colonel]] and cattle baron in the Western comedy spoof ''[[Rustlers' Rhapsody]]'' (1985).\n\nFollowing another short-lived return to series television, playing a family patriarch in the ''Dynasty''-inspired ''The Yeagers'' in 1980, Griffith continued to make guest appearances in several hit series, including ''[[Hotel (American TV series)|Hotel]]'', ''[[Fantasy Island]]'', where he played a fictional version of western figure [[Judge Roy Bean]] featured in an aspiring singer's fantasy, and an episode of ''[[The Love Boat]]'', which featured a memorable appearance by pop icon [[Andy Warhol]]. He also appeared as an attorney in the NBC miniseries ''[[Fatal Vision (miniseries)|Fatal Vision]]'' (1984), which is considered a precursor to his role in ''Matlock''.\n\nGriffith stunned many unfamiliar with his ''A Face in the Crowd'' work in the television film ''Crime of Innocence'' (1985)...wherein he portrayed a hateful and vindictive judge who routinely sentenced juveniles to hard prison time, followed by lengthy and equally-torturous probation. Also noteworthy in Griffith's darker roles was his character in ''Under the Influence'' (1986), a TV movie in which Griffith played an alcoholic, abusive patriarch. He further surprised audiences with his role as a dangerous and mysterious grandfather in the television film ''Gramps'' (1995) co-starring [[John Ritter]]. He also appeared as a comical villain in the spy movie spoof ''[[Spy Hard]]'' (1996) starring [[Leslie Nielsen]]. In the television film ''[[A Holiday Romance]]'' (1999), Griffith played the role of Jake Peterson. In the film ''[[Daddy and Them]]'' (2001), Griffith portrayed the patriarch of a dysfunctional southern family.\n\nIn the feature film ''[[Waitress (2007 film)|Waitress]]'' (2007), Griffith played a crusty [[diner]] owner who takes a shine to [[Keri Russell]]'s character. His last appearance was the leading role in the [[romantic comedy]], [[independent film]] ''[[Play the Game (2009 film)|Play the Game]]'' (2009) as a lonely, widowed grandfather re-entering the dating world after a 60-year hiatus. The cast of ''Play the Game'' also included [[Rance Howard]], Ron Howard's real-life father, who had made appearances in various supporting roles on ''The Andy Griffith Show'', and [[Clint Howard]], Ron's younger brother, who had the recurring role of Leon (the kid offering the ice cream cone or peanut butter sandwich) on ''The Andy Griffith Show''.\n\n===Singing and recording career===\nGriffith sang as part of some of his acting roles, most notably in ''A Face in the Crowd'' and in many episodes of both ''The Andy Griffith Show'' and ''Matlock''. In addition to his recordings of comic monologues in the 1950s, he made an album of upbeat country and gospel tunes during the run of ''The Andy Griffith Show'', which included a version of the show's theme sung by Griffith under the title \"[[The Fishin' Hole]]\". In later years, he recorded successful albums of classic Christian [[hymn]]s for [[Sparrow Records]]. His most successful was the release ''I Love to Tell the Story: 25 Timeless Hymns'' (1996), which was certified platinum by the RIAA.<ref name=RIAA>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH |title=RIAA Gold & Platinum (May 21, 2010) |publisher=Riaa.com |url-status=dead |access-date=February 11, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626050454/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH |archive-date=June 26, 2007 }}</ref> The album won [[Grammy Award for Best Southern, Country or Bluegrass Gospel Album]] at the [[1997 Grammy Awards]].<ref name=NYT>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/28/arts/winners-of-the-1997-grammy-awards.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=February 28, 1997 |title=Winners of the 1997 Grammy Awards |access-date=February 11, 2013}}</ref>\n\nGriffith appeared in country singer [[Brad Paisley]]'s music video \"[[Waitin' on a Woman]]\" (2008).<ref name=LAT>{{cite news|title=Brad Paisley on Andy Griffith, star of his 'Waitin' on a Woman' video|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/posts/la-et-ms-brad-paisley-remembers-andy-griffith-costar-of-his-waitin-on-a-woman-video-20120703,0,4137394.story|access-date=July 14, 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=July 3, 2012|author=Randy Lewis}}</ref>\n\n===Name dispute===\nWilliam Harold Fenrick of [[Platteville, Wisconsin]], legally changed his name to Andrew Jackson Griffith and ran unsuccessfully for sheriff of [[Grant County, Wisconsin|Grant County]] in November 2006.
