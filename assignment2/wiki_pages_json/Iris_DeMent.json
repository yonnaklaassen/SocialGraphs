Her parents required her to get a GED high school diploma. She later went with a boyfriend to Topeka, Kansas, where she attended [[Washburn University]].There she started writing after receiving positive feedback from her English composition professor.<REF>Clancy, Sean.

The song has been recorded by [[Kate Rusby]], Kate Brislin & [[Jody Stecher]] and [[Trampled by Turtles]].\n\nHer first album, ''[[Infamous Angel]]'', was released in 1992 on the Rounder-Philo label and explored such themes as religious skepticism, small-town life, and human frailty. \"Let the Mystery Be\" has been covered by a number of artists, including [[10,000 Maniacs]] (whose 'Unplugged' version featured Talking Heads' David Byrne), as well as [[Alice Stuart]]. It was also used in the opening scenes of the film ''[[Little Buddha]]''. In the fall of 2015, a version of \"Let the Mystery Be\" from the [[Transatlantic Sessions]] became the musical theme for the opening credits of the [[HBO]] series [[The Leftovers (TV series)|''The Leftovers'']], replacing the original \"Main Title Theme\" composed by [[Max Richter]], and it would once again serve as the opening theme for the series finale.\n\nIn her second album, ''My Life'', released in 1994, she continued the personal and introspective approach. The record is dedicated to her father, who died two years earlier. ''My Life'' was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] in the Best Contemporary Folk Album category.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=The 37th Grammy Nominations |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1995-01-06-ca-17089-story.html |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |location=Los Angeles |date=January 6, 1995 |access-date=February 24, 2015 }}\n</ref>\n\nDeMent's third album, ''[[The Way I Should]]'', was released in 1996.
