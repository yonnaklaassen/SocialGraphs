He scored three US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] hits in the 1980s as a solo artist, and later became tenor vocalist in the country music band [[BlackHawk]] in the 1990s. In addition, Van co-wrote several singles for other artists, such as [[Restless Heart]]. Stephenson died of [[melanoma]] in 2001.\n\n==Biography==\nStephenson was born in [[Hamilton, Ohio]], but moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], when he was ten years old, and he played in [[garage band]]s as a teenager. He graduated from [[seminary]] school and wrote songs on the side in the 1970s; his first chart hit as a songwriter was for [[Crystal Gayle]], who cracked the US country Top Ten with his \"Your Kisses Will\" in 1979. Stephenson went on to write hits for [[Kenny Rogers]], [[Dan Seals]], [[Janie Fricke]], and [[John Anderson (musician)|John Anderson]]. Partnering with Dave Robbins, Stephenson wrote a string of hits for [[Restless Heart]] and would continue to work with Robbins later in his career.\n\nStephenson landed a recording contract of his own with Handshake Records, through which he released his first solo album, ''China Girl'', in 1981.  He later signed with [[MCA Records|MCA]], and his second album, ''Righteous Anger'', was released in 1984.  He scored big on the [[Billboard magazine|Billboard]] charts with \"Modern Day Delilah\" peaking at No.&nbsp;22, and a second hit, \"What the Big Girls Do\", peaked at No.&nbsp;45.<ref>[{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p20751|pure_url=yes}} Billboard Singles], Allmusic.com</ref> ''Righteous Anger'' charted at No.&nbsp;54 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]],<ref>[{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p20751|pure_url=yes}} Billboard], Allmusic.com</ref> but his follow-up 1986 disc, ''Suspicious Heart'', did not chart, nor did its lead single, \"We're Doing Alright.\" It also included two songs featured on movie soundtracks: \"Make It Glamorous\" from the 1984 film ''[[The Wild Life (film)|The Wild Life]]'' and \"No Secrets\" from the 1985 film ''[[Secret Admirer (film)|Secret Admirer]]''. Stephenson returned to songwriting duties until the early 1990s, when he became one-third of [[BlackHawk]], a successful country group, through the end of the decade. In February 1999, Stephenson was diagnosed with [[melanoma]] and underwent surgery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1443631/blackhawks-van-stephenson-dead-at-47.jhtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921044335/http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1443631/blackhawks-van-stephenson-dead-at-47.jhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 21, 2008|title=BlackHawk's Van Stephenson Dead at 47|website=Cmt.com|access-date=December 6, 2017}}</ref> He left the group in February 2000 to continue battling the cancer, but he died on the morning of April 8, 2001, as a result of the disease.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/van-stephenson-mn0000312523|title=Van Stephenson – Biography & History|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=December 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Title\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Release\n!
