She recorded the 1983 crossover hit \"[[Baby I Lied]]\", which reached No.&nbsp;4 on the country chart and No.&nbsp;26 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Allen has also written No. 1 singles for herself, [[Janie Fricke]], and [[John Conlee]]; top 5 hits for [[Patty Loveless]] and [[Tanya Tucker]]; and a top 10 hit for [[the Whites]].\n\n== Early life and rise to fame ==\nAllen was born Deborah Lynn Thurmond in [[Memphis, Tennessee]].<ref name=\"Larkin80\" /> She was a [[beauty queen]] when she was a teenager.<ref name=\"encyclocountry\" />\n\nHer early musical influences included [[Elvis Presley]], [[Roy Orbison]], [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Al Green]], [[Ray Charles]], [[the Beatles]], [[the Rolling Stones]], [[Led Zeppelin]] and the then-current music played on Memphis stations [[WHBQ (AM)|WHBQ]] and [[WDIA]]; as well as country musicians such as [[Brenda Lee]], [[Patsy Cline]], [[Tammy Wynette]], [[Dolly Parton]], [[Willie Nelson]], [[Waylon Jennings]] and [[Johnny Cash]]. At age 19, Allen moved to Nashville to begin pursuing a music career.<ref name=\"encyclocountry\" /> She worked a short stint as a waitress at the local [[Music Row]] IHOP restaurant. While there one day, she met Roy Orbison and songwriter [[Joe Melson]]. They admired her spunk, and two weeks later, they decided to hire Allen to sing background vocals on a couple of Orbison tracks.\n\nAllen also auditioned for and landed a job at the [[Opryland USA]] theme park. She was soon chosen by Opryland as a featured soloist and dancer for a State Department exchange tour of Russia starring [[Tennessee Ernie Ford]].<ref name=\"auto\">Betts, Stephen L., AOL Music; Deborah Allen interview, Nov. 2011</ref>\n\nUpon her return from Russia, Allen gravitated to the Nashville offices of Waylon Jennings, [[Tompall & the Glaser Brothers|the Glaser Brothers]] and [[John Hartford]], where her close friend, Marie Barrett, worked as a secretary. There Allen met her soon-to-be songwriting mentor, the poet, playwright, artist and songwriter [[Shel Silverstein]].<ref name=\"Richter\" /> After watching her perform at a happy hour show at the Spence Manor on Nashville's Music Row, Silverstein advised Allen to pursue a songwriting career.\n\nAllen's singing career received a boost when she was chosen to be a regular on [[Jim Stafford]]'s summer replacement series on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television. She went on to be an opening act on many of the star's personal appearances. Stafford and producer [[Phil Gernhard]] brought Allen back to Nashville to record a [[CB radio]] novelty record, \"Do You Copy\", which was recorded live and released as a single on [[Warner Bros. Records]]. Although she appreciated the opportunity to record with Stafford and Gernhard, Allen was disheartened that after waiting patiently for two years to make her first record, it was a novelty tune. She decided to move back to Nashville to follow her true musical direction.<ref name=\"auto\" />\n\nIn 1979, producer Bud Logan saw Allen singing at a private party, and invited her to sing on five unfinished duet tracks by the late [[Jim Reeves]]. Three of these duets – \"Don't Let Me Cross Over\", \"Oh, How I Miss You Tonight\" and \"Take Me in Your Arms and Hold Me\"<ref name=\"Larkin80\" /> – were released as singles, and made the top 10 on the country charts for Reeves' longtime label, RCA Records. She was billed as \"The Mystery Singer\" on the first release, an innovative promotion by label head Joe Galante.\n\n== Career peak: 1980s ==\nAllen signed with [[Capitol Records]] in 1980. Her debut album for the label that year, ''[[Trouble in Paradise (Deborah Allen album)|Trouble in Paradise]]'',<ref name=\"Larkin80\" /> produced her initial solo hit \"Nobody's Fool\", peaking at No. 24 on the ''Billboard'' Country chart. Her subsequent (non-album) country chart singles \"You (Make Me Wonder Why)\", \"You Look Like the One I Love\" and \"After Tonight\" (co-written by [[Troy Seals]]) peaked at #20, #33 and #82 respectively. Allen had written a song at the time called \"Don't Worry 'Bout Me Baby\" with [[Bruce Channel]] and [[Kieran Kane]]. Although she pleaded with Capitol to let her record it and release it as a single, the label refused. With the assistance of music publisher [[Don Gant]], Janie Fricke's producer, [[Jim Ed Norman]], heard \"Don't Worry 'Bout Me Baby\" and recorded it with Fricke. The single became Allen's first ''Billboard'' No. 1 single as a songwriter.\n\nBy 1982, she had begun collaborating with songwriter Rafe Van Hoy, and they married that year.<ref name=\"encyclocountry\" />\n\nIn 1983, Allen moved to [[RCA Records]], finding success with her album ''[[Cheat the Night]].''<ref name=\"Larkin80\" /> The first single from the album, \"Baby I Lied\", became her signature song and her only crossover hit. It peaked at No. 4 on ''Billboard'''s Country chart and reached No. 26 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in January 1984.<ref name=\"Larkin80\" /> The song also climbed into the top 10 of the [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]] chart. Allen followed her crossover hit with the country single \"[[I've Been Wrong Before]]\", which went to No. 1 on the ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]]'' country chart and No. 2 on the ''Billboard'' Country chart in the spring of 1984. The song also earned Grammy Award nominations for [[Grammy Award for Best Country Song|Best Country Song]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance|Best Female Country Vocal Performance]]. \"I Hurt for You\", also from Allen's breakthrough album, became a top 10 country hit in 1984. Her follow-up album that year, ''Let Me Be the First'', was the first album digitally recorded in (and released from) Nashville. Allen made the charts once again in 1984 with \"Heartache and a Half\" (co-written with Van Hoy and Muscle Shoals songwriter Eddie Struzick).\n\nIn 1987, Allen released the single \"Telepathy\", written by [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] under the alias \"Joey Coco\".<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/deborah-allen-recalls-magical-telepathy-with-prince-174700/|title=Deborah Allen Recalls Magical 'Telepathy' With Prince|first1=Stephen L.|last1=Betts|date=April 21, 2016|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]}}</ref> A more pop-oriented album of the same name was also issued that year, and Allen released her last single for RCA, \"You're the Kind of Trouble\".\n\n== 1990s–2000s ==\nAllen co-wrote her No.&nbsp;1 hit \"Don't Worry 'Bout Me Baby\" and wrote the Tanya Tucker hit \"Can I See You Tonight\", and earned further No.&nbsp;1s for Janie Fricke (\"Let's Stop Talking About It\") and John Conlee (\"I'm Only in It for the Love\"), the latter a co-write with [[Kix Brooks]] and Van Hoy.<ref name=\"Larkin80\" />\n\nAfter she co-produced and financed her album ''[[Delta Dreamland]]'', Allen signed a contract with [[Giant Records (Warner)|Giant Records]] to release the album in 1993. The first single, \"Rock Me (In the Cradle of Love)\", charted at No.&nbsp;29 on the ''Billboard'' Country chart. The video for \"Rock Me\" was filmed on Allen's own 16&nbsp;mm Arriflex SR camera and edited on her Sony editing machine, and won Allen the Music City Summit Award for co-producing and co-directing. Allen had one other charting single from ''Delta Dreamland'', \"If You're Not Gonna Love Me\".\n\nAllen's 1994 album ''All That I Am'', which she co-produced with Giant label head James Stroud, featured the single \"Break These Chains\".\n\nAllen also appeared as herself in the 1993 [[Peter Bogdanovich]] film ''[[The Thing Called Love]]'', and performed \"Blame It on Your Heart\" and the Don Schlitz ballad \"Ready and Waiting\" on the film's soundtrack.\n\nAllen also signed a co-publishing deal and record deal with Curb music publishing and Curb Records in the 1990s. Her one album with Curb in 2000, ''The Best Of'', included a new version of her 1983 hit \"Baby I Lied\". \nFive of Allen's songs were recorded by [[LeAnn Rimes]] – two appear on the multi-platinum album ''Blue'' and three on ''Sittin' on Top of the World''. Mary Griffin's version of Allen's song \"We Can Get There\" appears in the film ''[[Coyote Ugly (film)|Coyote Ugly]]''.\n\n==2010s–present==\nAllen's album ''Hear Me Now'' was released through Delta Rock Records and GMV Nashville on August 16, 2011.<ref name=\"Richter\">{{cite web |last1=Richter |first1=Alison |title=Deborah Allen: \"it's one great big journey and lesson\" |url=https://guitargirlmag.com/interviews/deborah-allen-its-one-great-big-journey-and-lesson/ |website=Guitar Girl Magazine |access-date=9 January 2020 |date=3 September 2019}}</ref> The first single was \"Anything Other Than Love\", co-written by Gary Burr.
