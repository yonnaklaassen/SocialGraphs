She quit in early 1972. “I didn’t quit thinking: Do I embark on a folk music career?” she said. “I quit because I was in 15th grade, and enough was enough already.”<ref name=Daley2018 />\n\nNot long after leaving college, Wheeler was hired at a steakhouse as a waitress. “Within a week, the owners and me, we realized we made a terrible mistake,” she said. “I could never be a waitress. But they needed [a musician], and I thought maybe I could do that, and they were relieved to get me out of waitressing.\"<ref name=Daley2018 /> Around the same time, Wheeler began performing at clubs in the [[Washington, D.C.]], and [[Baltimore]] area.<ref name=Bellaire2015>{{Cite web|last1=Bellaire|first1=Rick|title=Cheryl Wheeler|url=http://www.ripopmusic.org/musical-artists/musicians/cheryl-wheeler/|website=Rhode Island Music Hall of Fame Historical Archive|date=April 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131025083307/http://www.ripopmusic.org:80/musical-artists/musicians/cheryl-wheeler/ |archive-date=October 25, 2013 |access-date=November 28, 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1976, Wheeler moved to [[Providence, Rhode Island]], and began playing at folk clubs throughout New England, opening for artists such as [[Jonathan Edwards (musician)|Jonathan Edwards]], [[Tom Rush]], [[Jesse Winchester]], and [[Gordon Lightfoot]].<ref name=Lenker /><ref name=Bellaire2015 /><ref name=Whitlock1996>{{Cite news|last=Whitlock|first=Jennifer|title=Several Singers Have Scored with Cheryl Wheeler Songs|url=https://www.mcall.com/news/mc-xpm-1996-01-19-3082110-story.html|work=[[The Morning Call]]|date=January 19, 1996|url-status=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 28, 2020}}{{deadlink|date=September 2023}}</ref> Her big break came when Edwards asked her to audition for a spot in his band as a bass player. Wheeler didn't play bass, but she bought one and auditioned nonetheless. “To my complete astonishment, I got the gig,\" Wheeler recalled. \"But I knew I didn't get it for my bass playing. So I thought I must've got it for my singing. So that was a real shot in the arm because I hadn't thought about it before, but I thought I might actually be a good singer if Jonathan Edwards is hiring me.\"<ref name=Lenker />\n\nIn 1983, Wheeler released her first album, a four-song EP called ''Newport Songs'', which is now out of print. Her next two releases – a self-titled album in 1986 and ''Half a Book'' in 1987 – were produced by North Star Records in Providence. The song “Addicted,” from the self-titled album, was recorded by country singer [[Dan Seals]] and became a No. 1 hit for him in 1988 on Billboard's Top 40 Country chart.<ref name=Bellaire2015 />\n\nFollowing the success of her first two full-length albums, Wheeler was signed to [[Capitol Records]] and released ''Circles and Arrows'' in 1990. [[Suzy Bogguss]] recorded Wheeler's song “Aces” from this album, and it reached #9 on the country charts in 1992. Wheeler's next four albums – ''Driving Home'' (1993), ''Mrs. Pinocci's Guitar'' (1995), ''Sylvia Hotel'' (1999), and ''Defying Gravity'' (2005) – were produced by the folk-oriented Philo-Rounder Records in Cambridge, Massachusetts.<ref name=Bellaire2015 />\n\nIn 2003, Wheeler approved the production of a double disc album, ''No Previous Record'',<ref>{{Cite web|title=No Previous Record|url=http://cherylwheeler.com/discog/npr.html|website=Cherylwheeler.com|access-date=October 3, 2006|archive-date=October 12, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012134701/http://www.cherylwheeler.com/discog/npr.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> which contains songs that never made it onto a commercial recording. Distribution of the album is free, but restricted to members of her e-mail list.{{citation needed|date=November 2020}}\n\nWheeler's two most-recent albums – ''Pointing at the Sun'' (2009) and ''Cheryl Wheeler Live'' (2012) – were released by her own record label, Dias Records.<ref name=DirtyLinen2009 /><ref name=Bellaire2015 />\n\nWheeler's songs have been covered by a number of other artists in addition to [[Dan Seals]] and [[Suzy Bogguss]]. They include [[Kathy Mattea]], [[Sylvia Kirby|Sylvia]], [[Garth Brooks]], [[Peter, Paul, and Mary]], [[Bette Midler]], [[Kenny Loggins]], [[Melanie Safka|Melanie]], [[Holly Near]], and D.C. Anderson.<ref name=Bellaire2015 /><ref name=DirtyLinen2009 /> Wheeler has said she doesn't purposefully write for other people, but she appreciates when others cover her songs. “[It’s] great. I make money if they do well,” she said. “But more than that, it's wonderful to have a singer you respect singing your song.\"<ref name=Whitlock1996 />\n\nHer song \"If It Were Up to Me\" (which was written shortly after the [[1998 Westside Middle School shooting]]), with the closing line \"If it were up to me, I'd take away the guns\" got nationwide attention shortly after the [[Columbine High School massacre]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=If It Were Up to Me|url=http://cherylwheeler.com/songs/iiwutm.html|website=Cherylwheeler.com|access-date=April 15, 2020|archive-date=October 20, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101020161720/http://cherylwheeler.com/songs/iiwutm.html|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=DirtyLinen2009 /> Wheeler released the recording into the public domain to exempt radio stations from paying royalties (it was being played every hour near the high school), and Rounder Records ran a promotional campaign to donate money to the [[Brady Campaign]] each time the song was played on [[Adult Album Alternative]] radio stations.{{citation needed|date=November 2020}}\n\nIn 2014, Wheeler was inducted into the Rhode Island Music Hall of Fame.<ref name=Bellaire2015 />\n\n==Performances==\nWheeler has toured extensively throughout her career, and her live concerts include both comedic and serious commentary in addition to the songs themselves. As one reviewer wrote, she “masterfully blends blisteringly on-target observational humor, simple storytelling, gorgeous guitar work, and beautiful, rich songs.”<ref name=Hill2007 /> Another commented on her “free-wheeling live concerts” and called Wheeler a “thoughtful, amusing musician and storyteller (and irrepressible social critic)…. [H]er patter is a delicious, folk-flavored blend of Phyllis Diller and Mort Sahl, sometimes puckish, sometimes barbed.”<ref name=McNally2017 />\n\nAbout half of the songs Wheeler performs in concert are not available on any of her albums.<ref name=Nostrand2016 /> Many never get recorded and eventually fade from her set list. Although she mostly tours alone, she has also toured with [[Kenny White]] (who produced a number of her albums). White generally opens for her and then plays and sings harmony during Wheeler's set.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cherylwheeler.com/home/promoconfig.html|title=Performance Configurations|website=Cherylwheeler.com|access-date=July 3, 2009|archive-date=June 19, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619105334/http://www.cherylwheeler.com/home/promoconfig.html|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=McNally2017 /> Wheeler has also toured with the [[Christine Lavin]]-inspired tour \"On a Winter's Night\" and occasionally as part of Lavin's consortium [[Four Bitchin' Babes]].<ref name=Nostrand2016 />\n\nWheeler participated in a concert with fellow folk singer-songwriters [[Shawn Colvin]] and [[Mary Chapin Carpenter]] in 1988, the year before Colvin released her debut album.<ref name=Nostrand2016 /> The three performed on two consecutive nights, to critical acclaim, at [[The Birchmere]] in [[Alexandria, Virginia]].
