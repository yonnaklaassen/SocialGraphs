Strait renamed the group the [[Ace in the Hole Band]], and quickly became the lead; they began to perform at different [[honky-tonk]]s and bars around south and central Texas, traveling as far east as [[Huntsville, Texas|Huntsville]] and [[Houston]].<ref name=\"album-notes-box\"/> They gained a regional following and opened for national acts such as [[The Texas Playboys]]. Soon his band was given the opportunity to record several Strait-penned singles, including \"That Don't Change The Way I Feel About You\" and \"I Can't Go On Dying Like This\" for the Houston-based D Records [[Independent record label|independent label]]. However, the songs never achieved wide recognition, and Strait continued to manage his family cattle ranch during the day to make some extra cash.<ref name=\"album-notes-box\"/><ref name=\"erlewine\"/>\n\nWhile he continued to play with his band, without any real connections to the recording industry, Strait became friends with Erv Woolsey, who operated one of the bars in which the Ace in the Hole band played and who had previously worked for the major label [[MCA Records]]. Woolsey convinced some of his [[Music Row]] (Nashville) connections to come to Texas and to listen to Strait and his band play. Impressed with the performance but concerned that they could not market the Western Swing sound that the band featured, they left without offering a deal.\n\nAfter several unsuccessful trips to Nashville in search of a record deal in which Strait was turned down by every label in town, he considered giving up music altogether. He was offered a job designing [[Cattle-pen|cattle pens]] and decided to take it. He gave the band notice that he was leaving, but after a discussion with his wife, she convinced him to give pursuing music one more year. Not long afterward, a major label, [[MCA Records|MCA]], signed Strait to a recording contract in February 1981. The initial deal was for one song. If the single did well, the label would consider doing an album.<ref name=\"billboard-1981\"/> The Ace in the Hole band remained with Strait, performing as the backup and touring band for the now solo career of Strait.<ref name=\"erlewine\"/>\n\n===1980s===\nIn the spring of 1981, Strait released his first single for MCA Records, titled \"[[Unwound (song)|Unwound]]\", which climbed to number six on the ''Billboard ''[[Hot Country Songs]] chart that year and was included on his debut album ''[[Strait Country]]''.

The singles \"Go On\" and \"If You Can Do Anything Else\" were released from the record, with both peaking in the top five. In May 2001, ''[[The Road Less Traveled (George Strait album)|The Road Less Traveled]]'' was released. Reviews for the album were mostly positive; ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' described it as sticking to the formula, \"but adds a few twists that make it superior to his last few releases.\"<ref name=\"rs-dresdale\"/> It featured \"vocal processing\", and was considered by some critics as an experimental album.<ref name=\"erlewine\"/> Three singles were released from it, two of which reached number one, including \"[[She'll Leave You with a Smile]]\", his 50th on combined charts and \"[[Living and Living Well]]\", both of which reached the top 30 of [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], with the former peaking at number 23, Strait's highest rank on the chart. The single \"[[Run (George Strait song)|Run]]\" peaked at number two and reached number 34 on the ''Billboard'' 100. Strait released two records in 2003. ''[[For the Last Time: Live from the Astrodome]]'' was a recording of the last [[Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo]] to take place in the [[Astrodome]].

That year, he issued a greatest hits package billed as ''[[50 Number Ones]]'', chronicling the number-one hits of his career from all charts, starting with \"Fool Hearted Memory\" and ending with \"She'll Leave You With a Smile.\" A new track, \"[[I Hate Everything (song)|I Hate Everything]]\", was also included, and became his 51st overall number one in 2004.\n\nThe next year, ''[[Somewhere Down in Texas]]'' arrived, which produced the hit \"You'll Be There\", marking Strait's first appearance on the adult contemporary chart. The next year, he embarked on a tour that included only 18 performances, but grossed over $15&nbsp;million. He attributed this success to the fact that his band and he are \"musically very tight\", have a large pool of songs to draw from, and perform those songs very similarly to how they sound on their albums.<ref name=\"gactv-stark\"/>\n\n[[File:George Strait 2014 3.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Strait on the Cowboy Rides Away Tour, XL Center, Hartford, Connecticut, February 23, 2013]]\n\nOn October 3, 2006, Strait marked his 30th year in the music industry with the release of a new album titled ''[[It Just Comes Natural]]''.

The lead single from the album, \"[[I Saw God Today]]\", debuted at number 19 on the ''Radio and Records'' and ''Billboard'' charts. It is the highest debut ever for a single from Strait and the fourth-highest debut for a song in country-music history. ''Troubadour'' debuted at number one on the ''Billboard'' Top 200 album charts, selling over 160,000 copies in its first week of release. \"[[River of Love]]\", the third single from the album, became his 57th number-one song in 2009.<ref name=\"cmt-morris\"/>\n[[File:George Strait 2014 2.jpg|thumb|Strait on the Cowboy Rides Away Tour at the Prudential Center in [[Newark, New Jersey]], March 1, 2014]]\nIn April 2009, Strait was honored by the Academy of Country Music with the Artist of the Decade Award, which was presented to Strait by the previous ACM Artist of the Decade, [[Garth Brooks]].

His 44 ''Billboard'' country number-one hits are a record, four more than [[Conway Twitty]]'s total that includes several duets with [[Loretta Lynn]].<ref name=\"american-chronicle-stark\"/> Additionally, Strait is also the first artist in the history of ''Billboard'' to have at least one single enter the top 10 of a ''Billboard'' chart for 30 consecutive years, starting in 1981 when his debut single \"Unwound\" peaked at number six on the Hot Country Singles chart.

He had a [[bit part]] in ''[[The Soldier (1982 film)|The Soldier]]'' (1982) and starred in ''[[Pure Country (film)|Pure Country]]'' (1992). He also appeared as himself in ''[[Grand Champion]]'' (2002).\n\nThe film ''Pure Country'' featured George Strait in the lead role as Dusty Chandler, a famous country singer who strays too far from his country roots and traditional sound. It provided the opportunity for Strait to branch out from his own traditional country sound for a more rock-and-roll approach. The film had little success at the box office and took in only $15&nbsp;million, but the soundtrack also called ''Pure Country'', produced several hit singles for Strait. It has become his best-selling album to date. Strait had a limited role in the sequel to ''Pure Country'', ''Pure Country 2: The Gift''.<ref name=\"cmt-new-film\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:50px;\"|Year\n! style=\"width:200px;\"|Title\n! style=\"width:200px;\"|Role\n|-\n|1982 ||''[[The Soldier (1982 film)|The Soldier]]'' ||Himself\n|-\n|1992 ||''[[Pure Country (film)|Pure Country]]'' ||Wyatt \"Dusty\" Chandler\n|-\n|2002 ||''[[Grand Champion]]'' ||Himself\n|-\n|2003 ||''[[King of the Hill]]'' ||Voice of Cornell\n|-\n|2010 || ''[[Pure Country 2: The Gift]]''||Himself\n|}\n\n== Honors and awards ==\n\n[[File:Hall of Fame Rotunda.jpg|thumb|upright|George Strait [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] plaque]]\n\nStrait holds the record for most number-one albums and singles, gold albums, platinum albums, and multiplatinum albums in the history of country music, and is 11th in the most number-one albums in all other genres. Strait is third only to [[Elvis Presley]] and [[The Beatles]] with the most gold and platinum albums in the history of music.<ref name=\"theboot-betts\"/> Strait has been certified as the 12th-best selling artist in American history, with career record sales of 70 million in the United States.<ref name=\"gather-billboard-record\"/>\n\nStrait has held the world record for most number one hit singles across all charts and genres with 60 number-one hits since 2013,<ref name=\"UDiscoverMusic\"/><ref name=\"radio-60\"/> and is the only artist in the history of music of any kind to have a top-10 hit every year for 30 years. He is also second all-time in top-10 hits in the history of music, currently five away from breaking the all-time record held by [[Eddy Arnold]], who had 92 in his historic career. Strait has won 22 [[CMA Awards]], including consecutive Entertainer of the Year honors in 1989 and 1990, and also just recently won that same honor in 2013 (and is the only artist to win the top honor in three different decades) and holds the career record for CMA nominations (as a whole) and the most consecutively of all time.\n\nAs of 2009, he holds the record for the most CMA awards. Strait also holds those same records for wins and nominations for the [[Academy of Country Music Awards]]. Strait was elected into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] in 2006, performing his then-latest number-one hit \"Give it Away\" right before accepting his replica Hall of Fame plaque at the 40th CMA Awards. He was only the second artist (after Eddy Arnold in 1966) to be inducted into the Hall of Fame while still actively recording and producing chart-topping hits and albums.\n\nAs of June 8, 2010, Strait was named the top country-music artist of the past 25 years according to ''Billboard''. In October 2008, the Academy of Country Music Awards named Strait their Artist of the Decade for the 2000s. He was presented the award by the previous winner Garth Brooks. Past winners of the award are [[Marty Robbins]] (1960s), [[Loretta Lynn]] (1970s), [[Alabama (American band)|Alabama]] (1980s), and [[Garth Brooks]] (1990s).<ref name=\"gs-awards\"/> With the win of the entertainer-of-the-year award in 2013, he is the only artist to ever win that award in three different decades and also was the oldest winner. The win is currently the longest span between wins for that award, as well. Strait is also tied with Merle Haggard for the most male vocalist-of-the-year awards.\n\nOn June 1, 2013, Strait appeared at the Alamodome, in [[San Antonio]], Texas, before 70,000 fans in the last concert of the first half of his two-year farewell tour. [[Governor of Texas|Governor]] [[Rick Perry]], who was in attendance with First Lady [[Anita Thigpen Perry]], announced that May 18, Strait's birthday, would be \"George Strait Day\" in Texas each year.<ref name=\"mysanantonio-saldana\"/>\n\nIn 2023, ''Rolling Stone'' ranked Strait at number 156 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=The 200 Greatest Singers of All Time|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=1 January 2023|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/best-singers-all-time-1234642307/george-strait-10-1234642928/|access-date=27 March 2023}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:5%;\"| Year\n! style=\"width:30%;\"| Award\n! style=\"width:30%;\"| Category\n! style=\"width:30%;\"| Work\n! style=\"width:5%;\" class=\"unsortable\"| {{Tooltip|Ref|Reference}}\n|-\n| 1985\n| [[Academy of Country Music]]\n| Top Male Vocalist\n|—\n|<ref name=\"amc-winners\"/>\n|-\n| 1985\n| [[Country Music Association]]\n| Male Vocalist of the Year\n|—\n|<ref name=\"cma-awards\"/>\n|-\n| 1985\n| Country Music Association\n| Album of the Year\n| ''Does Fort Worth Ever Cross Your Mind''\n|<ref name=\"cma-awards\"/>\n|-\n| 1986\n| Academy of Country Music\n| Top Male Vocalist\n|—\n|<ref name=\"amc-winners\"/>\n|-\n| 1986\n| Academy of Country Music\n| Album of the Year\n| ''Does Fort Worth Ever Cross Your Mind''\n|<ref name=\"amc-winners\"/>\n|-\n| 1986\n| Music City News Country\n| Male Artist of the Year\n|—\n|\n|-\n| 1986\n| Country Music Association\n| Male Vocalist of the Year\n|—\n|<ref name=\"cma-awards\"/>\n|-\n| 1986\n| Billboard Year-End Awards\n| Top Country Artist\n|—\n|\n|-\n| 1987\n| Billboard Year-End Awards\n| Top Country Artist\n|—\n|\n|-\n| 1988\n| Academy of Country Music\n| Top Male Vocalist\n|—\n|<ref name=\"amc-winners\"/>\n|-\n| 1989\n| Country Music Association\n| Entertainer of the Year\n|—\n|<ref name=\"cma-awards\"/>\n|-\n| 1989\n| Special\n| Connie B.
