Signed to [[Mercury Records]] in 1995, she released her [[Terri Clark (album)|self-titled debut]] that year. Both it and its two follow-ups, 1996's ''[[Just the Same]]'' and 1998's ''[[How I Feel (album)|How I Feel]]'', were certified platinum in both countries, and produced several Top Ten country hits.\n\nHer fourth album, 2000's ''[[Fearless (Terri Clark album)|Fearless]]'', though certified gold in Canada, was not as successful in the U.S., producing no Top 10 hits. ''[[Pain to Kill]]'' from 2003 restored her chart momentum in the U.S. with \"[[I Just Wanna Be Mad]]\" and \"[[I Wanna Do It All]]\", while a 2004 greatest hits album produced the Number One \"[[Girls Lie Too]]\". A non-album single, \"The World Needs a Drink\", and the 2005 album ''[[Life Goes On (Terri Clark album)|Life Goes On]]'' were her last releases for Mercury before she signed to [[BNA Records]] in 2007. There, she released the singles \"[[Dirty Girl (Terri Clark song)|Dirty Girl]]\" and \"[[In My Next Life]]\". Although the latter went to Number One in Canada, she has not released an album for BNA.\n\nClark's albums have accounted for more than twenty singles, including six Number Ones. \"[[If I Were You (Terri Clark song)|If I Were You]]\", \"[[Poor Poor Pitiful Me]]\",<ref>[http://news.nationalpost.com/arts/weekend-post/you-oughta-juno-what-happened-to-those-artists-voted-most-likely-to-succeed-part-1-1986-1999 \"You oughta Juno: What happened to those artists voted most likely to succeed?

At that time, country music executives were largely uninterested in traditional country, but record producer and singer [[Keith Stegall]] gave Clark advice and encouragement to not give up.<ref name=terri/> In 1994, Stegall became an executive at [[PolyGram]]/[[Mercury Records]] in Nashville and promptly signed Clark to a record deal.<ref name=terri/>\n\n=== 1995–1997: ''Terri Clark'' and ''Just the Same'' ===\nIn 1995, Clark issued her first single, \"[[Better Things to Do]].\" The song managed to reach the top five in both the United States and Canada.
