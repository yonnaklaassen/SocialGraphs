During his time on the tribe, he was quickly attracted to fellow contestant Brenda Lowe, who became aware of his attraction and used it to her advantage, recruiting him and several others into an alliance. After La Flor won three of the first four tribal immunity challenges, the tribes were blended and Rice ended up on the new version of the original \"older contestants\" tribe, Espada, while Lowe remained on the new version of the La Flor tribe. Rice and Lowe both ultimately made it to the merged group, Libertad, where their alliance successfully caused the eliminations of Alina Wilson and Marty Piombo, before turning on Lowe and eliminating her as a threat. Following Lowe's elimination, Rice continued with the alliance under new leader Matthew \"Sash\" Lenahan. After two contestants (NaOnka Mixon and \"Purple Kelly\" Shinn) quit, the alliance continued eliminating targets Ben \"Benry\" Henry, Jane Bright, Dan Lembo, and Holly Hoffman, although Bright and Hoffman were members of the alliance. The alliance tried to eliminate [[Jud Birza|Jud \"Fabio\" Birza]] as a threat against the jury, but Birza managed to evade them by winning the last three immunity challenges. Rice performed exceptionally well in the post-merge challenges, being on the winning team in two of the three team-oriented rewards, and winning the last two individual rewards. Eventually, Rice made it to the final three with Lenahan and Birza, where he had a chance to win the $1 million as \"Sole Survivor\". In pleading his case to the jury, Rice claimed that he was being open about how he played the game, but was criticized both for his rash decisions and occasional indecisiveness, as well as being perceived as a follower under both Lowe and Lenahan. Although both Rice and Lenahan tried to accuse Birza of not knowing what was going on in the competition, the jury still ultimately chose Birza who received five of the nine votes; Rice received the votes of Hoffman, Bright, Lowe, and Wilson.\n\nOn the nationally televised reunion show, Rice played his single \"Buzz Back\".<ref name=\"Country Song on Season Finale\">{{cite web|last=Wilkening|first=Matthew|title='Survivor' Finalist Chase Rice Debuts Country Song on Season Finale|date=December 20, 2010 |url=http://tasteofcountry.com/survivor-finalist-chase-rice-country-song-season-finale/|publisher=Taste of Country}}</ref> Although he received national media attention on the show, he says that reality show stardom did not help propel his country music career; instead, he cited it as an important life event that was more valuable than money and that put his life in perspective.\n\nIn the official issue of ''[[CBS Watch]]'' magazine, commemorating the 15th anniversary of ''[[Survivor (TV series)|Survivor]]'' in 2015, Rice was voted by viewers as the 10th \"steamiest\" male contestant in ''Survivor'' history.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/DaltonRoss/status/565168330513080320 |title=Wait, where's @JohnMCochran? |publisher=Twitter |first=Dalton |last=Ross |date=February 10, 2015 |access-date=February 10, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Country music career==\n[[File:Chase Rice Mojo Club 2020.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Rice in 2020]]\nChase Rice began playing guitar in college.
