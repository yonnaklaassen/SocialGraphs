Sahm is regarded as one of the main figures of [[Tejano music|Tex-Mex music]], and as an important performer of [[Music of Texas|Texan Music]]. He gained fame along with his band, the [[Sir Douglas Quintet]], with a top-twenty hit in the United States and the United Kingdom with \"[[She's About a Mover]]\" (1965). Sahm was influenced by the San Antonio music scene that included [[conjunto]] and [[blues]], and later by the [[hippie]] scene of [[San Francisco]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Garcia |first=Camille |date=November 15, 2016 |title=Sir Doug Tells Lesser-known Story of SA's Doug Sahm, the 'Groover's Groover' |url=http://sanantonioreport.org/sir-doug-tells-lesser-known-story-of-sas-doug-sahm-the-groovers-groover/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230321210522/https://sanantonioreport.org/sir-doug-tells-lesser-known-story-of-sas-doug-sahm-the-groovers-groover/ |archive-date=March 21, 2023 |access-date=May 23, 2024 |website=San Antonio Report |language=en-US}}</ref> With his blend of music, he found success performing in [[Austin, Texas]], as the hippie counterculture soared in the 1970s.\n\nSahm began singing at age five and learned to play the steel guitar at age six. He was considered a [[child prodigy]] on the instrument. By the age of eight, he had appeared on the ''[[Louisiana Hayride]]''. He made his recording debut as \"Little Doug\" in 1955, and was influenced by [[rock and roll]] during his teenage years. Sahm had local hit records, while he played clubs as a musician for other bands. In 1965, [[Huey P. Meaux]] produced Sahm and the Sir Douglas Quintet's \"She's About a Mover\". The same year, Sahm moved to California. In 1971, he returned to San Antonio, and soon after he moved to Austin. [[Atlantic Records]] signed Sahm and released his debut solo album ''[[Doug Sahm and Band]]'' in 1973.\n\nAfter a continuing decline in record sales, Sahm kept performing in clubs in Austin, and moved through different record labels. Meanwhile, he enjoyed success in Sweden and in Canada. In 1989, Sahm formed the [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] the [[Texas Tornados]] with fellow Tex-Mex musicians [[Augie Meyers]], [[Freddy Fender]] and [[Flaco Jiménez]]. The Texas Tornados toured successfully, and one of their releases earned a [[Grammy Award]]. In 1999, Sahm died during a vacation trip. A posthumous album, ''[[The Return of Wayne Douglas]]'', was released in 2000. Sahm received multiple honors in the state of Texas, including hall of fame inductions and memorials in public places.\n\n==Early life and start in music==\nDoug Sahm was born in [[San Antonio, Texas]], on November&nbsp;6, 1941, to Victor&nbsp;A.

Determined to find the reason for the commercial success of [[The Beatles]] sound, Meaux said he purchased several of their records and rented three rooms at the Wayfarer Hotel in San Antonio. According to his account, he drank a case of [[Flavored fortified wine|Thunderbird wine]] in the process.{{sfn|Leigh, Spencer|2016|p=155}} Meaux felt the Beatles' songs shared a common ground with traditional [[Two-step (dance move)|two-step]] [[Cajun music]].{{sfn|Meaux, Francois|2018|p=92}} He called Sahm and asked him to write songs based on that style, and to let his hair grow.{{sfn|Leigh, Spencer|2016|p=155}} Sahm and Meyers appeared with [[The Dave Clark Five]] in San Antonio, where they were featured on the program, with their respective bands, as the opening acts.
