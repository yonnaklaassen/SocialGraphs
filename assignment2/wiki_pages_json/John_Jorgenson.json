These three groups were composed of the same four members, who changed costumes and music styles at intervals throughout each day.\n\n==Later years==\nIn 1993 Jorgenson formed the guitar trio the [[Hellecasters]] with [[Will Ray]] and guitarist [[Jerry Donahue]] of [[Fairport Convention]]. Intended as a temporary collaboration, the Hellecasters went on to release several albums during the 1990s. Their debut, ''Return of the Hellecasters'' (1993) won both \"Album of the Year\" and \"Country Album of the Year\" from ''[[Guitar Player]]'' magazine.\n\nIn 1994 he was invited to join Elton John's band for an 18-month tour. He remained with the band for the next six years, performing both live and in the studio, occasionally on saxophone. In 2002 he played bass guitar in the All-star Bluegrass Celebration in Nashville. Two years later he portrayed jazz guitarist [[Django Reinhardt]] in the film ''[[Head in the Clouds (film)|Head in the Clouds]]''.\n\nJorgenson collaborated with [[Brad Paisley]], [[James Burton]], [[Vince Gill]], [[Albert Lee]], [[Brent Mason]], [[Redd Volkaert]] and [[Steve Wariner]] on the song \"Cluster Pluck\", on Paisley's album ''[[Play (Brad Paisley album)|Play]]'' (2009). The song won a [[Grammy Award]] in the Best Country Instrumental Performance category.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.grammy.com/nominees/search?artist=Jorgenson&field_nominee_work_value=&year=All&genre=All&=Search |title=Past Winners Search |work=Grammy.com |access-date=August 14, 2015}}</ref>\n\nHe is a patron for [[Guitar-X]] ([[Tech Music Schools]]) in London, where he regularly visits to hold master classes. He is also a patron for [[Le QuecumBar]], the world's only music venue dedicated to Gypsy swing in London.\n\nHis [[gypsy jazz]] ensemble, ''[[John Jorgenson Quintet]]'' includes Doug Martin (rhythm guitar), [[Jason Anick]] (violin), Simon Planting (bass), and Rick Reed (percussion).\n\n==Custom guitars==\n[[Image:Jorgenson.jpg|right|thumb|220px|John Jorgenson performs in Liverpool (2006) with his Fender Hellecaster guitar.]]\nG&L Guitars made a very few signature John Jorgenson ASAT guitars in Silver Sparkle with Silver Sparkle Pickguard, rosewood fretboard and Black ASAT Pickups in 1995.  Fender made signature guitar models for Jorgensen in 1997 and 1998. The Fender Limited Edition John Jorgenson Hellecaster was made in Japan in 1997. It features a black sparkle-finished maple body, vintage-tinted, high-gloss maple neck with reversed large-style Strat headstock, rosewood fretboard with gold sparkle dot inlays, 22 jumbo frets and Schaller locking tuners. Refinements included three [[Seymour Duncan]] custom-voiced, split-coil, hum-cancelling pickups which allow players to get controlled feedback in distortion mode and a custom-wired, five-way pickup selector switch with an additional push/pull control allowing seven tone variations. Other touches included a custom two-pivot-point tremolo, a Wilkinson \"Wilkaloid\" self-lubricating nut, gold sparkle pickguard and gold hardware.\n\nThe Fender John Jorgenson Signature Custom Korina Telecaster was made at the Fender Custom Shop in 1998, sporting a solid Korina body, a maple neck with pearloid dot inlays and a 25.5\" scale length, African rosewood or an ebony on black finish fretboard with 22 Dunlop 6130 frets. Other features included dual side-by-side Telecaster humbucking pickups, a modified vintage style Tele bridge, a special custom five-way pickup switching featuring five different combinations (each in humbucking mode), 1.688\" width at the nut and Sperzel Trimlok locking tuners.\n\nIn 1994, he became the third artist to have a custom signature series guitar built by [[Takamine Guitars]]. The JJ325SRC and the twelve-string JJ325SRC-12, born from the EF325SRCA, feature a spruce top with bubinga back and sides in a gloss red satin finish, a rosewood fretboard on a mahogany neck with his signature J.J. inlay on the 12th fret, and gold tubes with white pearloid knobs.<ref>{{cite web |title=John Jorgensen JJ325SRC & JJ325SRC-12 |url=https://www.takamine.com/signature-stories-model3 |publisher=Takamine}}</ref>\n\nThe most recent John Jorgenson signature guitar is the [[Fret-King]] FKV25JJ in Arcadian and Versailles Green. Designed in conjunction with Trev Wilkinson, the guitar is packed with a whole host of features including a chambered body, three self-intonating brass saddles, a matched, calibrated set of Wilkinson WVT pickups and two auxiliary â€˜ghostâ€™ coils which provide both hum-cancelling and classic single coil tones at the turn of a dial, thanks to the unique â€˜Vari-coilâ€™ control. John's Fret-King signature model will be joined by the FKV25JCAR in Candy Apple Red in 2019. 2019 will also see both Fret-King Jorgenson models shift from chambered to solid body construction.\n\n==Discography==\n===As leader===\n* ''After You've Gone'' (Curb, 1988)\n* ''Crop Circles'' with Davey Johnstone (Solid Air, 1999)\n* ''Emotional Savant'' (J2, 1999)\n* ''Franco-American Swing'' (J2, 2004)\n* ''Ultraspontane'' (J2, 2007)\n* ''Istiqbal Gathering'' (J2, 2010)\n* ''One Stolen Night'' (J2, 2010)\n* ''J2B2 Special Edition'' (J2, 2014)\n* ''From the Crow's Nest'' (Cleopatra, 2017)\n\n'''With [[The Desert Rose Band]]'''\n* ''The Desert Rose Band'' (Curb, 1987)\n* ''Running'' (Curb, 1988)\n* ''Pages of Life'' (Curb, 1990)\n* ''True Love'' (Curb, 1991)\n* ''Life Goes On'' (MSI, 2007)\n\n'''With [[The Hellecasters]]'''\n* ''The Return of the Hellecasters'' (Pacific Arts Audio, 1993)\n* ''Escape from Hollywood'' (Rio, 1994)\n* ''Hell III New Axes to Grind'' (Pharaoh, 1997)\n\n===As sideman===\n'''With [[Kenny Chesney]]'''\n* ''[[No Shoes, No Shirt, No Problems]]'' (BNA, 2002)\n* ''[[All I Want for Christmas Is a Real Good Tan]]'' (BNA, 2003)\n* ''[[When the Sun Goes Down (Kenny Chesney album)|When the Sun Goes Down]]'' (BNA, 2004)\n* ''[[Be as You Are (Songs from an Old Blue Chair)]]'' (BNA, 2005)\n* ''[[The Road and the Radio]]'' (BNA, 2005)\n\n'''With [[Rodney Crowell]]'''\n* ''[[Jewel of the South]]'' (MCA, 1995)\n* ''[[The Houston Kid]]'' (Sugar Hill, 2001)\n* ''[[Fate's Right Hand (album)|Fate's Right Hand]]'' (DMZ, 2003)\n* ''Christmas Everywhere'' (New West, 2018)\n* ''Texas'' (RC1, 2019)\n\n'''With [[Jerry Donahue]]'''\n* ''Telecasting'' (Making Waves, 1986)\n* ''Neck of the Wood'' (the Road Goes On Forever, 1992)\n* ''Telecasting Recast'' (Telebender Music, 1998)\n\n'''With [[Firefall]]'''\n* ''[[Comet (Firefall album)|Comet]]'' (Sunset, 2020)\n\n'''With [[Neal McCoy]]'''\n* ''[[24-7-365 (Neal McCoy album)|24-7-365]]'' (Giant, 2000)\n\n'''With [[Michael Nesmith]]'''\n* ''[[Tropical Campfires]]'' (Pacific Arts Audio, 1992)\n\n'''With [[Syd Straw]]'''\n* ''Surprise'' (Virgin Records, 1989)\n\n'''With others'''\n* [[Chad Brock]], ''[[Yes!
