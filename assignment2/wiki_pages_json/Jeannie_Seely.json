After being briefly signed with [[Challenge Records (1950s-60s label)|Challenge Records]], she moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], to further elevate her country music recording career. In Nashville, Seely's \"Don't Touch Me\" was released on [[Monument Records]] and reached the US country top five. She followed it with several more top ten and 20 songs, including \"[[A Wanderin' Man]]\" (1967) and \"[[I'll Love You More (Than You'll Need)]]\" (1968).\n\nSeely then formed a duet musical partnership with [[Jack Greene]] and they began collaborating together in the late 1960s. Their highest-charting single was 1969's \"[[Wish I Didn't Have to Miss You]]\" and they subsequently toured over the next decade. Her solo career continued with the popular singles \"[[Can I Sleep in Your Arms]]\" (1973) and \"[[Lucky Ladies]]\" (1974). After a car accident in 1977, Seely's career went on a brief hiatus and then resumed new projects. This included appeares in the [[Willie Nelson]] film ''[[Honeysuckle Rose (film)|Honeysuckle Rose]]'' and acted in several stage plays, opening a Nashville bar and becoming the first female to host the Grand Ole Opry.\n\nIn the 1990s, Seely returned to recording albums with a 1990 eponymous release, followed by her first album of [[Christmas music|holiday music]] in 1994 called ''[[Number One Christmas]]''.
