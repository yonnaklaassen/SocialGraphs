Between 2005 and 2007, Harp and [[Michelle Branch]] recorded and performed as [[The Wreckers]], a duo that topped the country charts in 2006 with the [[Grammy Awards|Grammy-nominated]] \"[[Leave the Pieces]]\". After The Wreckers disbanded, Harp began a solo career on [[Warner Records|Warner Bros. Records]], the same label to which The Wreckers were signed. Her solo second album single, \"[[Boy Like Me]]\", debuted in March 2009 and was a top 30 hit on the U.S. ''Billboard'' Hot Country Songs chart. It was followed by her second album, ''[[A Woman Needs]]'', in March 2010.\n\n== Biography ==\nJessica Harp grew up with her parents and her sister, Annie, in Kansas City, Missouri. She began singing when she was 3, wrote lyrics when she was 8, and picked up guitar at 13. In 2002, she pursued a solo career in music, releasing her independent album, ''Preface''. She then worked as a backup vocalist for various country acts.\n\n=== 2005–2007: The Wreckers ===\nShe provided backing vocals for her long-time friend [[Michelle Branch]]'s album, ''[[Hotel Paper]]''. After working together, Harp joined up with Branch in 2005 to form a country duo, known as [[The Wreckers]], whose song \"The Good Kind\" was featured on ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]'' and its soundtrack. The group's debut country single, \"[[Leave the Pieces]]\", was released in February 2006. It was followed by their debut album, ''[[Stand Still, Look Pretty]]'', which was released on May 23, 2006. \"Leave the Pieces\" reached Number One on the U.S. ''Billboard'' Hot Country Songs chart in September 2006. The album produced two additional singles in \"[[My, Oh My (The Wreckers song)|My, Oh My]]\" (a Top 10 hit) and \"Tennessee\" and was certified [[Gold album|Gold]] by the RIAA for reaching sales of over 500,000.\n\nHarp appeared on the very first live game broadcast by the [[NFL Network]] on November 23, 2006, to sing the [[The Star-Spangled Banner|American national anthem]] before the [[Thanksgiving Day]] game between her hometown [[Kansas City Chiefs]] and the [[Denver Broncos]].<ref>[http://kcchiefs.com/news/2006/11/13/broncos_vs_chiefs__1123__volunteers_needed Thanksgiving game – Volunteers needed!] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930181654/http://kcchiefs.com/news/2006/11/13/broncos_vs_chiefs__1123__volunteers_needed |date=September 30, 2007}} ''KCChiefs.com'', November 13, 2006.</ref> They later performed the National Anthem at the 55th Annual NHL All-Star Game on January 24, 2007.\n\nDespite the success of their Number One debut single, album sales, and a nomination for the [[2007 Grammy Awards]] for [[Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]] for the song \"Leave the Pieces\", both Harp and Branch announced in August 2007 that they were putting The Wreckers on hold, while both went forward with solo albums.<ref>[https://www.foxnews.com/story/fox-facts-complete-list-of-grammy-award-nominations \"FOX Facts: Complete List of Grammy Award Nominations\"].
