They began to write together and charted with many top 20 hits.\n\nTorok reached the Billboard charts several times: in 1957 with \"Pledge of Love\" (Billboard Top 20), written by his wife, Gail Redd; in 1959 with an updated version of \"Caribbean\" (No. 27 on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''); with \"Redneck Nat' Anthem\" by [[Vernon Oxford]] in 1976; with [[Jerry Wallace]] and their song \"This One's on the House\" (Top 20); and with [[Bill Phillips (singer)|Bill Phillips]]'s \"I Can Stand It (As Long as She Can)\". In 1960, Torok's recording of \"Pink Chiffon\" topped out at No.&nbsp;60 on ''Billboard''. His last hit record was \"Instant Love\" in 1965, produced by Jimmie Bowen.\n\n==Early life and education==\nMitchell Joseph Torok was born in [[Houston, Texas]] on October 28, 1929,<ref name=\"Larkin50\"/> to [[Hungarians in the United States|Hungarian immigrants]].

Austin State University]] in [[Nacogdoches, Texas]] from 1948 to 1953, on a football and baseball scholarship. Torok majored in art and minored in world history, and played baseball in [[Garrison, Texas]] whilst studying.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Seo-lCjT-fgC&dq=mitchell+torok+hungarian+irene&pg=PT179 I Forgot To Remember To Forget (2012), chapter 59]</ref>\n\n==Early career and chart success==\nTorok recorded his first session in Houston with a duet partner named Sally Lee. These masters later wound up on Imperial Records. During the next two years, he performed his own morning radio show on KSFA and KFRD, in Rosenberg and KTRE in Lufkin. The owner of KFRD heard him and suggested that he record some songs.  He recorded \"Nacogdoches County Line\" with the FBC label for his first single.<ref name=escott /> He also recorded \"Piney Woods Boogie\".\n\nOne of Torok's idols, [[Hank Williams]], died suddenly on January 1, 1953.<ref name=AlvinSun>{{cite web |title=At 84, Mitchell Torok moves to Alvin after life writing hit songs, painting mural of Elvis in Vegas and writing books|url=http://www.alvinsun.net/news/article_cbc57252-cc1b-11e3-97f5-0019bb2963f4.html |access-date=4 October 2021}}</ref> Inspired by a need for some happy songs, he immediately penned a happy-go-lucky song titled \"Mexican Joe,\" which he wrote in thirty minutes based on \"[[Polly Wolly Doodle]]\", initially intending the song for another one of his idols, [[Hank Snow]].<ref name=\"Larkin50\"/>\n\nBut a new record producer and label owner from Hollywood, Fabor Robison, happened by Nacogdoches and found Torok and the song. Torok wanted one of Robison's supposed heavy West Coast artist to record his song. He reluctantly gave it to him and his Abbott record label, to be recorded by one of his own struggling artists, the then unknown Jim Reeves, in Shreveport. (Torok, feeling the chances of Reeves' record hitting were small or nonexistent, planned to use the Jim Reeves record as a \"demo\" to send to Hank Snow.) Reeves had been hired to be an announcer on KWKH and the ''Hayride Show'', but not allowed to sing. Torok's song, \"Mexican Joe\", was recorded by Reeves and it became a number one hit, and spent seven weeks riding the top of the ''Billboard'' Country Music Charts. Torok was then signed to Abbott Records.<ref name=\"Larkin50\"/>\n\nA month later he wrote \"Caribbean\", which he recorded. The song became popular in both the ''Billboard'' Country and Jukebox charts, and remained at the top for four weeks. It stayed on the country chart for 24 weeks, also a top five hit on both the Best Sellers and Disc Jockey charts,<ref name=\"Larkin50\"/> as well as being a No. 13 hit in Australia.\n\nTorok became a member of ''[[Louisiana Hayride]]'' on KWKH-AM in Shreveport.<ref name=\"Larkin50\"/> In 1954, his song \"My Arabian Baby\" appeared as the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] of Snow's hit \"I Don't Hurt Anymore\". Torok gained a No. 8 country hit with \"Hootchy Kootchy Henry (From Hawaii)\"<ref name=\"Larkin50\"/> and in 1956, after joining Decca Records in Nashville, he had top ten success on the [[UK Singles Chart]] with his and Gail's song, \"When Mexico Gave Up The Rhumba\" and \"Red Light, Green Light\".<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\">{{cite book| first= David| last= Roberts| year= 2006| title= British Hit Singles & Albums| edition= 19th| publisher= Guinness World Records Limited| location= London| isbn= 1-904994-10-5| page= 562}}</ref>\n\nThis success led to a four-month tour of the [[United Kingdom]] in 1957,<ref name=\"Larkin50\"/> headlining at the [[London Palladium]]. His shows included English comedian [[Dickie Henderson]] and [[Shirley Bassey]]. It marked the only time Torok has performed with a full pit orchestra with written arrangements on all the songs, led by Torok's own conductor, Maurice \" Tex\" Bromley, at the on-stage piano with him.<ref name=\"Larkin50\"/>\n\nTorok also had another hits on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in 1957 &ndash; \"Pledge of Love\" hit No.&nbsp;25 in 1957.<ref name=\"hot100\">[[Joel Whitburn]], ''The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits''. 7th edition, 2000; {{isbn|978-0823076901}}</ref> \"Pledge of Love\" however was a bigger hit for [[Kenneth Copeland]], who recorded over Torok's backing track. Unexpectedly, his previous country song \"Caribbean\" was re-released in 1959 after Robison sold the master to Guyden Records,<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FKsSBREliAgC&pg=PA101| title=Roadkill on the Three-chord Highway: Art and Trash in American Popular Music|first= Colin |last=Escott |date= 2002 |pages=100&ndash;101|publisher=Routledge |isbn=9780415937832 }}</ref> and the song peaked at No.&nbsp;27 on ''Billboard'' Hot 100.<ref name=\"hot100\"/>  In 1960, \"Pink Chiffon\", also on Jamie/Guyden peaked at No.&nbsp;60 and, in 1996, this song was used as main title music in [[RKO Pictures]] film ''Laura Smiles'' (2006). Torok also made further recordings for [[Mercury Records|Mercury]], and [[RCA Records|RCA]]. His last US chart entry was \"Instant Love\" for the [[Reprise Records|Reprise]] record label in 1967.<ref name=\"Larkin50\"/>\n\n==Later career in music and art==\n{{more citations needed section|date=October 2022}}\n\nTorok continued to write songs, working in partnership with his wife (who has used both \"Gayle Jones\" and \"Ramona Redd\" as pseudonyms, the latter being her maiden name).<ref name=\"Larkin50\"/> Their songs were recorded by artists including: [[Skeeter Davis]], [[Kitty Wells]], Hank Snow and Willie Nelson, Jerry Wallace, Billy Walker, Barbara Eden, [[Glen Campbell]], [[Dean Martin]].<ref name=\"Larkin50\"/> [[Clint Eastwood]] sang their song, \"No Sweeter Cheater than You\" in the Warner Brothers ''Honky Tonk Man'' movie. They also wrote the title song \"Look Out, Ol' Norwood's Comin' Home!\" for Glen Campbell's Paramount movie ''Norwood'', and five other songs on different Campbell albums, including \"Arkansas, a tribute to Glen's home state. Hank Snow recorded Torok's songs: \"Caribbean\", \"Dogbone\", \"My Arabian Baby\" and \"The Mysterious Lady From St. Martinique\" on one of his last RCA albums.<ref name=\"Larkin50\"/> \"The Redneck National Anthem\" was a top 20 hit for [[Vernon Oxford]] in 1976.\n\nCombining his art and music, Torok was commissioned to paint a 110-foot, five-panel mural titled \"The History of the Grand Ol' Opry\", which was on display in the [[Ryman Auditorium]] until it was remodeled for live performances. The mural served as a fund raiser for Hank Snow's Abused Children's Foundation while there, as tourists made donations after viewing the mural. He then created the \"Elvis-a-Rama\", which consisted of a 12-foot-high, 125-foot-long mural with a 22-minute light and music show depicting his life, from his truck driving days in Memphis to his death in 1977. It has been shown in Nashville, in Branson, and recently in Las Vegas, and has been signed by over 50,000 Elvis fans.\n\nMitchell and his writing-partner, wife Gail also created a tribute to Nashville's 200th birthday while writing for Cedarwood Music, with a 12-song LP recording titled ''Nashville'', filled with songs based on Music City's history.<ref name=\"Larkin50\"/> They also wrote, produced and performed on a Texas history album, titled ''The Ballads of Texas''.<ref>[https://newspaperarchive.com/big-spring-herald-sep-24-1972-p-76/ Big Spring Herald, 24 September 1972, pg. 76]</ref> Torok also wrote a book and accompanying CD, titled ''Jim Reeves, Me & Mexican Joe'', which tells the story of how the song made its way to Reeves. Torok also created smaller artistic tributes to Alabama coach Paul \"Bear\" Bryant, Dolly Parton, Big John Merritt and other smaller creations.\n\n== Personal life and death ==\nTorok married Gail Redd, a beauty queen, from [[Lufkin, Texas]], in 1951.<ref>[https://www.newspapers.com/image/6257337/?terms=%22Gail%20Redd%22%20torok&match=1 The Baytown Sun, 11 Sep 1952, pg. 26]</ref> She died on August 3, 1985, at the age of 52.<ref>[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/86483356/ The Tennessean, 7 August 1985, pg. 19]</ref>\n\nIn April 2014, it was reported that Torok had moved to [[Alvin, Texas]] at the age of 84, to live with his daughter.<ref name=AlvinSun/> He died in Alvin on November 16, 2017, at the age of 88.<ref name=allmusic>[https://www.allmusic.com/artist/mitchell-torok-mn0000576795/biography Biography, ''AllMusic''].
