Sandra Brennan wrote of him in 2021: \"One of the most influential modern banjoists, both in several forms of bluegrass music and occasionally in jazz and avant-garde, Tony Trischka has inspired a whole generation of progressive bluegrass musicians.\"<ref name=Brennan>{{cite web |last=Brennan |first=Sandra |work=[[AllMusic]] |date=2021 |title=Tony Trischka Biography by Sandra Brennan |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/tony-trischka-mn0000202033/biography |accessdate=2022-12-02}}</ref>\n\n==Music career==\n[[File:Bruce Molsky and Tony Trischka, New Bedford Folk Festival 2022.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bruce Molsky]] (L) and Tony Trischka at the 2022 New Bedford Folk Festival]]\nA native of Syracuse, New York, Trischka's interest in banjo was sparked by [[the Kingston Trio]]'s version of \"[[M.T.A. (song)|Charlie and the MTA]]\" in 1963. Two years later, he joined the Down City Ramblers, where he remained through 1971. That year, he made his recording debut on ''15 Bluegrass Instrumentals'' with the band Country Cooking; at the same time, he was also a member of America's premier sports-rock band Country Granola.\n\nIn 1973, he began a three-year stint with Breakfast Special. Between 1974 and 1975, he recorded two solo albums, ''Bluegrass Light'' and ''Heartlands''. Ethnomusicologist Benjamin Krakauer devotes an article to the legacy of this group in the bluegrass community, described as of ''experimental bluegrass musicians from New York City'':<ref name=\"Krakauer\">{{cite journal |last1= Krakauer|first1=Benjamin |date= Summer 2018|title=Music Scene and Its Fringes: Experimental Bluegrass of 1970s New York City |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5406/americanmusic.36.2.0163 |journal=American Music  |volume= 36|issue=2 |pages=163-193 |doi= 10.5406/americanmusic.36.2.0163|access-date=February 19, 2024}}</ref> {{Blockquote|text=Breakfast Special's innovative music incorporates jazz, avant-garde, psychedelic, klezmer, and various non- Western musical elements into their irreverent and often absurdist performances}}. This researcher explores the question of why their music has never been absorbed into the bluegrass mainstream, while the newgrass and progressive blue-grass of many of their innovative peers was widely embraced :  Benjamin Krakauer argues:<ref name=\"Krakauer\"/> {{Blockquote|text= that breakfast Special’s eclecticism and related aesthetic choices made their music inaccessible to many bluegrass audiences and that the unfa-miliar aspects of this music and its presentation exacerbated conservative southern white audiences’ anxieties over the performers’ regional, ethnic, religious, and cultural otherness}} \nAfter one more solo album in 1976, ''Banjoland'', he went on to become musical leader for the Broadway show ''[[The Robber Bridegroom (musical)|The Robber Bridegroom]]''. Trischka toured with the show in 1978, the year he also played with the [[Monroe Doctrine]].\nIn 1978, Trischka toured Japan and recorded with [[Peter Rowan]] and [[Richard Greene (musician)|Richard Greene]]. In the early 1980s, he began recording with his group Skyline, which released its first album in 1983. Later albums included ''Robot Plane Flies over Arkansas'' (solo, 1983), ''Stranded in the Moonlight'' (with Skyline, 1984) and ''Hill Country'' (solo, 1985). In 1984, he performed in his first feature film, ''[[Foxfire (1987 film)|Foxfire]]''. Three years later, he worked on the pre-recorded music for the off-Broadway production of ''[[Driving Miss Daisy (play)|Driving Miss Daisy]]'' that featured Jessica Tandy and [[Morgan Freeman]]. Trischka produced the Belgian group Gold Rush's ''No More Angels'' in 1988. The following year, Skyline recorded its final album, ''Fire of Grace''. He also recorded the theme song for ''Books on the Air'', a popular [[National Public Radio]] show, and continued his affiliation with the network by appearing on [[Garrison Keillor]]'s ''[[Prairie Home Companion]]'', ''[[Mountain Stage]]'', ''From Our Front Porch'', and other radio shows. Trischka continued his recording career with 1993's ''World Turning'', 1995's ''Glory Shone Around: A Christmas Collection'' and 1999's ''Bend''. ''New Deal'' followed in 2003.\n\n''Double Banjo Bluegrass Spectacular'', featuring appearances by [[Steve Martin]], [[Earl Scruggs]], [[Béla Fleck]] and [[Tony Rice]], came out four years later. For this recording Trischka went back to bluegrass and reinvigorated the double banjo tradition. In October 2007, he was given an IBMA (International Bluegrass Music Association) award for Banjo Player of the Year 2007. ''Double Banjo Bluegrass Spectacular'' received IBMA awards for Recorded Event of the Year, Instrumental Album of the Year and a Grammy Nomination.\n\nHe has written over fifteen instructional books and a series of DVDs. In July 2009 he launched the groundbreaking ''Online Banjo School with Tony Trischka'', an interactive, online learning school that teaches students around the world how to play banjo with [[ArtistWorks]]. Trischka is closely associated with \"newgrass,\" which features several innovations to traditional bluegrass, including jazzy arrangements, non-traditional chordal structures, and frequent covers of non-bluegrass songs. Trischka is one of the major innovators of the \"chromatic\" banjo style, which features sinewy, snaky melodic runs not strictly played out of chord positions.\n\n2011 saw ''Give Me the Banjo'' aired on PBS stations nationwide with Trischka as the musical director and co-producer of the documentary. It was released on DVD. He produced [[Steve Martin]]'s Grammy-nominated ''Rare Bird Alert'' ([[Rounder Records|Rounder]]), which features performances by [[Paul McCartney]], the [[Dixie Chicks]] and the [[Steep Canyon Rangers]].\n\nIn December 2012, Trischka was awarded the United States Artists Friends Fellow in recognition of the excellence of his work.<ref>{{Cite web|title=United States Artists » Tony Trischka|url=https://www.unitedstatesartists.org/fellow/tony-trischka/|access-date=July 11, 2021|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n===As leader===\n* ''Bluegrass Light'' ([[Rounder Records|Rounder]], 1974)\n* ''Heartlands'' ([[Rounder Records|Rounder]], 1975)\n* ''Banjoland'' ([[Rounder Records|Rounder]], 1977)\n* ''Fiddle Tunes for Banjo'' with [[Bill Keith (musician)|Bill Keith]] and [[Béla Fleck]] (Rounder, 1981)\n* ''A Robot Plane Flies over Arkansas'' ([[Rounder Records|Rounder]], 1983)\n* ''Hill Country'' ([[Rounder Records|Rounder]], 1985)\n* ''Alone & Together'' with [[Beppe Gambetta]] ([[Brambus Records|Brambus]], 1991)\n* ''Solo Banjo Works'' with [[Béla Fleck]] ([[Rounder Records|Rounder]], 1992)\n* ''[[World Turning (Tony Trischka album)|World Turning]]'' ([[Rounder Records|Rounder]], 1995)\n* ''Glory Shone Around: A Christmas Collection'' ([[Rounder Records|Rounder]], 1995)\n* ''Double Banjo Bluegrass Spectacular'' ([[Rounder Records|Rounder]], 2007)\n* ''Territory'' ([[Smithsonian Folkways]] 2008)\n* ''Great Big World'' (Rounder, 2014)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rounder.com/2014/02/new-releases/great-big-world |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140316005112/http://www.rounder.com/2014/02/new-releases/great-big-world |archive-date=March 16, 2014 |title=Great Big World {{!}} Rounder Records}}</ref>\n*Of A Winter's Night (Independent, 2014)\n*The Durban Sessions (Independent, 2019)\n* ''Shall We Hope'' ([[Shefa Records]], 2021)\n* ''Earl Jam'' (2024)\n\n===With the Big Dogs===\n* ''Live at the Birchmere'' ([[Strictly Country]], 1993)\n\n===With Psychograss===\n* ''Psychograss'' ([[Windham Hill Records|Windham Hill]], 1993)\n* ''Like Minds'' ([[Sugar Hill Records (bluegrass label)|Sugar Hil]], 1996)\n* ''Now Hear This'' (Adventure Music America, 2005)\n\n===With [[Skyline (musical group)|Skyline]]===\n* ''Late to Work'' ([[Flying Fish Records|Flying Fish]], 1981)\n* ''Stranded in the Moonlight'' ([[Flying Fish Records|Flying Fish]], 1984)\n* ''Skyline Drive'' ([[Flying Fish Records|Flying Fish]], 1986)\n* ''Fire of Grace'' ([[Flying Fish Records|Flying Fish]], 1989)\n\n===With the Wayfaring Strangers===\n* ''Shifting Sands of Time'' ([[Rounder Records|Rounder]], 2001)\n* ''This Train'' ([[Rounder Records|Rounder]], 2003)\n\n==Television appearances==\n* ''Merv Griffin Show'', 1976\n* Nashville Network's ''Fire on the Mountain'', 1984, 1986\n* Ralph Emery's \"Frets\" Awards Show, The Nashville Network, 1987\n* CBS Hallmark Hall of Fame production of ''Foxfire'' with Jessica Tandy, Hume Cronyn and John Denver, 1987\n* British television production of ''Echoes of America: History of the Five String Banjo'', 1989\n* ''Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?''
