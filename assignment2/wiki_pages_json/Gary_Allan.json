His second album, ''[[It Would Be You]]'', followed in 1998. Allan's third album, ''[[Smoke Rings in the Dark]]'', was his first one for [[Universal Music Group Nashville|MCA Nashville]] (to which he has been signed ever since) and his first [[platinum album]]. His next albums, ''[[Alright Guy]]'' (2001) and ''[[See If I Care (Gary Allan album)|See If I Care]]'' (2003), both were also certified platinum while ''[[Tough All Over (Gary Allan album)|Tough All Over]]'' (2005) and ''[[Greatest Hits (Gary Allan album)|Greatest Hits]]'' (2007) and ''[[Living Hard]]'' (2007) were all certified gold.

Overall, Allan's ten studio and greatest hits albums have produced 26 singles on the U.S. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] and [[Country Airplay]] charts, including the number one hits \"[[Man to Man (song)|Man to Man]]\", \"[[Tough Little Boys]]\" (both 2003), \"[[Nothing On but the Radio]]\" (2004), and \"[[Every Storm (Runs Out of Rain)]]\" (2013).\n\n== Personal life ==\n[[File:GaryAllanExitsStage.JPG|thumb|Allan exits stage in Mescalaro, New Mexico]]\nGary Allan Herzberg was born on December 5, 1967, in [[La Mirada, California]],<ref name=\"allmusic\" /> to Harley and Mary Herzberg.

At age 13, Allan began playing in [[honky tonks]] with his father.<ref name=\"allmusic\" /><ref name=\"paulik\" /> Two years later, he was offered his first recording contract, from [[A&M Records]], but rejected the deal.

I thought sleep was what you did when you go to school.\"<ref name=\"dave\" />\n\nAfter graduating from [[La Serna High School]] in [[Whittier, California]], Allan continued to play in the bars with his band, the Honky Tonk Wranglers. Many of the venues they played were packed, and promoters often tried to move them to larger clubs. The moves would have required him to stop playing some of the older country music, such as covers of [[George Jones]] songs, so Allan refused.<ref name=\"paulik\" />\n\nIn 1987, Gary married his first wife, Tracy Taylor.

Seal and Hill had asked Allan if they could showcase an unsigned act that they were developing there. Hill had arranged to bring the head of [[A&R]] from a major label to the show to see this other act perform. Allan kindly let them use his stage for the event, giving the new act the opening performance slot that night. Hill promised Allan that they would make sure the A&R person remained there to see his portion of the show. Everyone was knocked out with Allan's performance, and very impressed with his voice. From that point on, Byron Hill began sending Allan songs. Without any serious funding at the time, Hill arranged for Allan to go into Seal's small studio in California to try his vocals on some of existing demo tracks that Byron had sent to Allan from [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. Meanwhile, Hill became head of A&R at [[BNA Records|BNA Entertainment]] on October 29 of that same year and immediately wanted to sign Allan to BNA, but the then current roster conditions and other circumstances related to the planned restructuring of [[RCA Records Nashville|RCA/BNA Nashville]] stood in the way.<ref name=\"hill\">[http://www.byronhillmusic.com/prod_allan.htm Gary Allan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061127160401/http://www.byronhillmusic.com/prod_allan.htm |date=November 27, 2006 }}. – Byron Hill Music</ref>\n\n=== From demo to deal ===\nIn the meantime, Allan took a job selling cars.  He left a demo tape in the glove box of a truck purchased by a wealthy couple. When the couple discovered that he was the singer, they wrote him a check for $12,000.<ref name=\"dave\" /> This independent funding allowed Allan to go to Nashville to record some of the songs that were on that early demo tape with [[Byron Hill]] as producer.<ref name=\"hill\" /> On September 11, 1995, they worked at Javelina Studios for a couple of days on the four songs that Hill immediately showed to labels. Allan's recordings brought serious responses from several labels including [[Mercury Records|Mercury]], [[RCA Records|RCA]], and [[Decca Records|Decca]].<ref name=\"hill\" /> A meeting was then held at a Nashville hotel among Hill, Allan, and friend of Allan's, who was a program director for a radio station in California.<ref name=\"hill\" />\n\nThe meeting was to arrange two showcases in [[Los Angeles, California]], to put Allan on stage at two of the radio station's regular nights at a local club. Hill arranged for staffers at the Nashville office of Decca Records to attend the first showcase held on November 1, 1995. Decca immediately wanted to sign Allan, and knowing that Hill was lining up other labels to see Allan, Decca asked them to cancel the second showcase. A rep from RCA was already booked to see the second showcase the following week, but the \"bird-in-hand\" deal offer was too tempting for both Allan and Hill, so they committed to the Decca offer.<ref name=\"hill\" /> Decca staffer Mark Wright and Byron Hill co-produced Allan's first three albums for Decca beginning sessions on March 11, 1996, for ''Used Heart for Sale'', then ''It Would Be You'', both of which yielded top five singles, and later ''Smoke Rings in the Dark'' (which also included [[Tony Brown (record producer)|Tony Brown]] as a co-producer). It was during the recording of the first album that they recorded \"It Must Have Been Ol' Santa Claus\", as an added track to be packaged on various MCA/Decca Christmas compilations.<ref name=\"hill\" /> Then Allan and Hill got a personal call from [[Harry Connick, Jr.]], the writer of the song, thanking them for the recording, during which he added a few of his [[Dixieland|New Orleans Jazz]] style \"very cool man!\" compliments. The Christmas recording has been since released on at least four compilations. The merger of [[PolyGram]], Decca, and [[MCA Records]] marked the closing of Decca and Allan was moved to MCA Records.<ref name=\"hill\" />\n\n== Career ==\n[[File:Gary Allan Wiki.jpg|right|thumb|Allan performing in 2006]]\n\n=== ''Used Heart for Sale'' ===\nHis first deal, with [[Decca Records]] Nashville, produced his debut studio album ''[[Used Heart for Sale]]'' in 1996.<ref name=\"allmusic\" /> The album was named \"Best of the Month\" by ''Stereo Review''.<ref name=\"kling\" />  It advanced to the Top 20 of the charts. Its first single, \"[[Her Man (song)|Her Man]]\" (previously recorded by [[Waylon Jennings]]) gave Allan his first Top 10 country hit on the U.S. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] chart. Other tracks from this album, however, proved less successful.\n\n=== ''It Would Be You'' ===\nAllan's second studio album, ''[[It Would Be You]]'', was released in 1998.  Although he has been writing songs since his teen years,<ref name=\"dave\" /> the singer has not really hesitated to bump his work from his albums in favor of those written by other songwriters that he respects. For this album, Allan replaced one of his songs with \"No Judgement Day\", written by Allen Shamblin. Even though that song was a hidden acoustic track, radio stations started giving it some heavy airplay.<ref name=\"dave\" />  \"No Judgement Day\" tells the story of a restaurant owner from a small town in Texas, where ex co-workers killed him in search of money, for drugs and alcohol. The album's [[It Would Be You (Gary Allan song)|title track]] became Allan's second hit to reach the Top 10 on the U.S. country charts, remaining there after 21 weeks of radio play, \"way beyond the tenure of most disposable radio hits.\"<ref name=\"kling\">{{Cite news|last=Kling|first=Reno|title=Hardcore Gary Allan and his dream J-200 guitar|date=July 1998|url=http://www.gibson.com/magazines/amplifier/1998/7/feature.html|access-date=August 2, 2007|newspaper=The Amplifier|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930182559/http://www.gibson.com/magazines/amplifier/1998/7/feature.html|archive-date=September 30, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> In early-1999, Decca Records folded, and when Allan moved to the parent label, [[Universal Music Group Nashville|MCA Nashville]], the ''It Would Be You'' album was left in limbo.<ref name=\"paulik\" />\n\nAllan was named as \"Country Music's Sexy Star\" by ''[[People Magazine]]''. He also delved into the acting world in the TV [[mini-series]] ''Shake, Rattle, & Roll'', in which he would play the lead role of [[Eddie Cochran]]. He followed that role with a part in the CBS TV series ''Pensacola: Wings of Gold'', but describes his acting experience as \"tedious.\"<ref name=\"dave\" />\n\n=== ''Smoke Rings in the Dark'' ===\nIn 1999, Allan released his third studio album ''[[Smoke Rings in the Dark]]''.<ref name=\"allmusic\" /> This was an album that he recorded while in the midst of divorcing from his second wife, [[Gianni Versace S.p.A.|Versace]] model Danette Day, after only seven months of marriage.<ref name=\"dave\" />  Unlike his first two albums, ''Smoke Rings in the Dark'' made fuller use of background singers and stringed instruments, \"resulting in a lusher, fuller sound.\"<ref name=\"paulikreview\">{{cite web|last=Paulik|first=Laura|title=Review of Gary Allan's CD \"Smoke Rings in the Dark\"|publisher=Mountain West Music|url=http://www.mountainwestmusic.com/CDReviews/Allan_CDRev.html|access-date=August 2, 2007}}</ref>  The new album avoided the \"devil-may-care brashness\" of the first two, instead presenting a tone balanced between youthful optimism and \"the knowledge that some of life's experiences exact a high toll.\"<ref name=\"paulikreview\" /> ''Smoke Rings in the Dark'' was certified platinum, and it included two successful singles, including its [[Smoke Rings in the Dark (song)|title track]].\n\n=== ''Alright Guy'' ===\nThe singer's fourth studio album ''[[Alright Guy]]'' was released in 2001.<ref name=\"allmusic\" /> It contained the singles \"The One\", \"Man of Me\", and \"Man to Man\", the latter of which became his first number one hit on the U.S. ''Billboard'' country charts.<ref name=\"shelburne\" /> That same year, Allan married for the third time, to Angela, a [[flight attendant]] whom he met on an airplane.<ref name=\"people\" />\n\n=== ''See If I Care'' ===\nDespite his previous success and eight years in the music business, Allan was nominated for the [[Country Music Association]]'s Horizon Award, typically given to newcomers, in 2003. The same year, he released his fifth studio album ''[[See If I Care (Gary Allan album)|See If I Care]].'' Allan had to be controversial to keep the album's title. Also, he thought that title had epitomized his attitude towards the music business, and that he would continue to make the music that he wanted to make regardless of whether the record label chose to back him or people chose to buy the album.<ref name=\"gimlin\">{{cite web|last=Gimlin|first=Angela|title=Gary Allan: Music, Awards, and Politics|publisher=[[Country Music Television|CMT]]|url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1479642/20031008/allan_gary.jhtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930044626/http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1479642/20031008/allan_gary.jhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 30, 2007|date=October 8, 2003|access-date=August 2, 2007}}</ref>  ''See If I Care'' included Allan's second and third number one singles with \"[[Tough Little Boys]]\", and \"[[Nothing On but the Radio]].\"<ref name=\"shelburne\">{{cite web|last=Shelburne|first=Craig|title=Allan's \"Tough Little Boys\" Hits No. 1|publisher=[[Country Music Television|CMT]]|url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1479817/20031017/allan_gary.jhtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930061616/http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1479817/20031017/allan_gary.jhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 30, 2007|date=October 18, 2003|access-date=August 2, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Allan's \"Nothing On but the Radio\" Hits No. 1.\"|publisher=[[Country Music Television|CMT]]|date=November 29, 2004|url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1494235/20041129/allan_gary.jhtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930040908/http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1494235/20041129/allan_gary.jhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 30, 2007|access-date=August 2, 2007}}</ref>  \"Songs About Rain\" was a Top 15 hit.\n\n=== ''Tough All Over'' ===\nIn 2003, Allan and his wife, Angela Herzberg, moved to [[Tennessee]] from California.
