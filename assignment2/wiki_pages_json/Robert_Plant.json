He was the lead singer and lyricist of the rock band [[Led Zeppelin]] from its founding in 1968 until their breakup in 1980. Since then, he has had a successful solo career, sometimes collaborating with other artists such as [[Alison Krauss]]. Regarded by many as one of the greatest singers in rock music, he is known for his flamboyant persona and raw stage performances.\n\nPlant was born and raised in the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] area of England, where, after leaving [[grammar school]], he briefly trained as a chartered accountant before leaving home at 16 years old to concentrate on singing with a series of local blues bands, including [[Band of Joy]] with [[John Bonham]]. In 1968, he was invited by [[Peter Grant (music manager)|Peter Grant]] and [[Jimmy Page]] to join [[The Yardbirds]], which Grant and Page were attempting to keep going after it had broken up (a breakup that became public knowledge by early July at the latest<ref>Rock, John J. ''Rolling Stone'' 6 July 1968</ref>). The new version of The Yardbirds changed their name to Led Zeppelin, and from the late 1960s to the end of the 1970s, the band enjoyed considerable success.\n\nPlant developed a compelling image as a charismatic rock-and-roll frontman, comparable to other '70s contemporaries such as [[Mick Jagger]] of [[the Rolling Stones]], [[Roger Daltrey]] of [[the Who]], and [[Jim Morrison]] of [[the Doors]]. After Led Zeppelin dissolved in 1980, Plant continued to perform and record continuously on a variety of solo and group projects. His first two solo albums, ''[[Pictures at Eleven]]'' (1982) and ''[[The Principle of Moments]]'' (1983), each reached the top ten on the Billboard albums chart. With his band [[The Honeydrippers]] he scored a top-ten single hit with a remake of \"[[Sea of Love (Phil Phillips song)|Sea of Love]]\", which featured former Led Zeppelin bandmate Jimmy Page on guitar. Solo album ''[[Now and Zen]]'' (1988) was certified 3× Platinum and is Plant's biggest-selling solo album to date. In the 1990s, another reunion project called [[Page and Plant]] released two albums and earned a [[Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance]] in 1998 for \"[[Most High (song)|Most High]]\". In 2007, Plant began a collaboration with bluegrass artist Alison Krauss, releasing the album ''[[Raising Sand]]'', which won the [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]] in 2009 and produced the hit song \"[[Please Read the Letter]]\", which won the [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year]] the same year. In 2010, he revived the [[Band of Joy]] (which shared its name with an early band he performed with in the 1960s), and in 2012 formed a new band, the Sensational Space Shifters, followed by a reunion with Alison Krauss in 2019.\n\nIn 1995, Led Zeppelin were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].<ref name=Hall/> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked Plant as one of the 100 best singers of all time (2008);<ref name=\"ROLLS\">[https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-singers-of-all-time-19691231/robert-plant-20101202 100 Greatest Singers Of All Time: Robert Plant] ''[[Rolling Stone]]''.

He grew up close to the Welsh border and would often take summer trips to [[Snowdonia]]. Plant bought a Welsh sheep farm in 1973, and began taking Welsh lessons and looking into the mythology of the land (such as [[Black Book of Carmarthen]], [[Book of Taliesin]], etc.) Plant's first son, Karac, was named after the Welsh warrior [[Caratacus]]. The song \"[[Bron-Y-Aur Stomp]]\" is named after the 18th-century Welsh cottage [[Bron-Yr-Aur]], owned by a friend of his father; it later inspired the song \"[[Bron-Yr-Aur (instrumental)|Bron-Yr-Aur]]\".<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book |title=The Life and Times of Led Zeppelin |last=Morris |first=Robin |publisher=Assegai Publishing |year=2012 |isbn=9781620957936 |location=Jeffreys Bay, South Africa |pages=50}}</ref> The songs \"Misty Mountain Hop\", \"[[That's the Way (Led Zeppelin song)|That's the Way]]\", and early dabblings in what would become \"[[Stairway to Heaven]]\" were written in Wales and lyrically reflect Plant's mystical view of the land. Critic Steve Turner suggests that Plant's early and continued experiences in Wales served as the foundation for his broader interest in the mythologies he revisits in his lyrics (including those myth systems of Tolkien and the Norse).<ref>\"Stairway to Heaven, Paved with Gold: Led Zeppelin's Snowdonia\", ''The Independent'', 6 April 1991.</ref>\n\nPage's passion for diverse musical experiences influenced Plant to explore Africa, specifically [[Marrakesh]] in Morocco, where he encountered [[Umm Kulthum]]:\n\n{{blockquote|I was intrigued by the scales, initially, and obviously the vocal work.

On stage, Plant was particularly active in live performances, often dancing, jumping, skipping, snapping his fingers, clapping, making emphatic gestures to emphasise a lyric or cymbal crash, throwing back his head, or placing his hands on his hips. As the 1970s progressed he, along with the other members of Led Zeppelin, became increasingly flamboyant on-stage, and wore more elaborate, colourful clothing and jewellery.\n\nAccording to ''[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]'' magazine, \"once he had a couple of US tours under his belt, \"Percy\" Plant swiftly developed a staggering degree of bravado and swagger that irrefutably enhanced Led Zeppelin's rapidly burgeoning appeal.\"<ref>Fortnam, Ian (2008). \"Dazed & Confused\", ''[[Classic Rock Magazine]]: Classic Rock Presents Led Zeppelin'', p. 43.{{full citation needed|date=July 2022}}</ref> In 1994, during his \"Unledded\" tour with Jimmy Page, Plant himself reflected tongue-in-cheek upon his Led Zeppelin showmanship:\n\n{{blockquote|I can't take my whole persona as a singer back then very seriously.

He nevertheless embarked on a successful solo career, helped by encouragement from [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] drummer [[Phil Collins]], who would go on to play with him.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.musictimes.com/articles/23372/20150106/robert-plant-praises-phil-collins-encouraging-solo-career-led-zeppelin-split.htm |title=Robert Plant Praises Phil Collins For Encouraging His Solo Career After Led Zeppelin's Split |work=Music Times |first=Shawn |last=Christ |date=6 January 2015 |access-date=21 July 2015}}</ref> Plant's solo career began with the album ''[[Pictures at Eleven]]'' in 1982, followed by 1983's ''[[The Principle of Moments]]''. Popular tracks from this period include \"[[Big Log]]\" (a Top 20 hit in 1983), \"[[In the Mood (Robert Plant song)|In the Mood]]\" (1983), \"[[Little by Little (Robert Plant song)|Little by Little]]\" (from 1985's ''[[Shaken 'n' Stirred]]''), \"Far Post\" (the B-side of \"[[Burning Down One Side]]\"), which appeared on the soundtrack of the 1985 movie ''[[White Nights (1985 film)|White Nights]]'' starring [[Gregory Hines]] and [[Mikhail Baryshnikov]], and popularised by airplay on [[album-oriented rock]] stations), \"[[Tall Cool One (Robert Plant song)|Tall Cool One]]\" (a No. 25 hit from 1988's ''[[Now and Zen]]'') and later \"[[I Believe (Robert Plant song)|I Believe]]\" (from 1993's ''[[Fate of Nations]]''). This last track, like Led Zeppelin's \"[[All My Love (Led Zeppelin song)|All My Love]]\", was written for and dedicated to his late son, Karac. Whilst Plant avoided performing Led Zeppelin songs through much of this period (although he would occasionally improvise his unique Zeppelin screams into his set), his tours in 1983 (with Phil Collins on drums) and in 1985 were very successful, often performing to sold-out arena-sized venues. In 1986 Plant performed at the [[Heart Beat 86|Birmingham Heart Beat Charity Concert]] with other famous Midlands musicians. \n[[File:Robert Plant and Phil Johnstone, backstage at Glastonbury Festival, 1993.jpg|alt=The two men looking rocked-out and happy posing for a photo|thumb|Plant, [[Phil Johnstone]], and ''[[Creem]]'' editor [[Dusty Wright]], backstage at the [[Glastonbury Festival]], 1993]]\n\nDuring the late 1980s and early 1990s Plant co-wrote three solo albums with keyboardist/songwriter [[Phil Johnstone]]. These were: ''[[Now and Zen]]'' in 1988, ''[[Manic Nirvana]]'' in 1990, and the 1993 ''[[Fate of Nations]]'' (which features [[Moya Brennan]] of [[Clannad (musical group)|Clannad]] and former [[Cutting Crew]] guitarist [[Kevin MacMichael|Kevin Scott MacMichael]]). Songs from this third album, plus a smattering of Led Zeppelin classics, made up the set-list for Plant's acclaimed sunset performance on the Main Stage at Glastonbury Festival, in 1993.<ref>{{Cite web|title = 1993|url = http://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/history/history-1993/|website = Glastonbury Festival – 24–28 June 2015|access-date = 12 February 2016|first = Pretty Good|last = Digital}}</ref> It was Johnstone who talked Plant into playing Led Zeppelin songs in his live shows, something Plant had always previously resisted, not wanting to be forever known as \"the former Led Zeppelin vocalist\".{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nAlthough Led Zeppelin disbanded in 1980, Plant occasionally collaborated with [[Jimmy Page]] on various projects through this period, including forming a short-lived all-star group with Page and [[Jeff Beck]] in 1984, called [[the Honeydrippers]]. They released an EP called ''[[The Honeydrippers: Volume One]]'', and the band had a No. 3 hit with a remake of the [[Phil Phillips]]' tune \"[[Sea of Love (Phil Phillips song)|Sea of Love]]\", plus a follow-up hit with a cover of [[Roy Brown (blues musician)|Roy Brown]]'s \"[[Rockin' at Midnight]]\". The pair again worked together in the studio on the 1988 Page solo effort ''[[Outrider (album)|Outrider]]'', and in the same year Page contributed to Plant's album ''Now and Zen''. Also, on 15 May 1988 Plant appeared with Page as a member of Led Zeppelin, at the [[Atlantic Records 40th Anniversary]] concert (where he also performed in his own right as a solo artist). Plant's live collaborations with other well-known musicians continued when he took to the stage with Queen at Wembley Stadium, for 1992's \"The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert\" for AIDS Awareness; where he sang Queen's \"[[Innuendo (song)|Innuendo]]\" and \"[[Crazy Little Thing Called Love]]\", and Led Zeppelin's \"[[Kashmir (song)|Kashmir]]\" and \"[[Thank You (Led Zeppelin song)|Thank You]]\".\n\n===Page and Plant (1994–1998)===\n[[Page and Plant]] became a full-fledged performing act from 1994 through 1998, releasing the ''[[No Quarter: Jimmy Page and Robert Plant Unledded]]'' album in 1994 and following with an enormously successful tour in 1995, including a return to the Glastonbury Festival.<ref name=\"Lewis 2010 p. 553\">{{cite book | last=Lewis | first=D. | title=Led Zeppelin: The 'Tight But Loose' Files | publisher=Music Sales | year=2010 | isbn=978-0-85712-220-9 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jOzTNQk0C48C&pg=PT553 | access-date=19 August 2023 | page=553}}</ref> Fourteen years of speculation from their fans and occasional sniping between the two former members ended when they reconvened their former musical partnership to produce ''No Quarter''. Having long resisted offers from MTV to reform to do an ''Unplugged'' show, they finally accepted as part of a deal that also allowed them to visit Morocco to record new material. The album combines the results of both of these projects. The Led Zeppelin material features new arrangements and new instrumentation, including strings, Egyptian musicians and the vocals of British-Asian star Najma Akhtar.\n\nPage and Plant recorded their only post-Zeppelin album of original material as the 1998 album ''[[Walking into Clarksdale]]'', an effort that was unsuccessful commercially, leading Plant to return to his solo career after another world tour. A song from this album, \"[[Please Read the Letter]]\", was re-recorded by Plant with [[Alison Krauss]], and was featured on their 2007 album which won the [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year]].\n\n=== Priory of Brion and reunion with Page (1999–2001) ===\nStarting in mid-1999, Plant performed until the end of 2000 at several small venues with his folk-rock band, named Priory of Brion. This band consisted of the original Band of Joy guitarist Kevyn Gammond alongside [[Andy Edwards (musician)|Andy Edwards]] (drums), Paul Timothy (keyboards), and Paul Wetton (bass). The Priory of Brion played around one hundred concerts across Europe at various small clubs and festivals. The band performed cover versions of songs that had influenced Plant in his formative years. Many of these cover versions would crop up later on his [[Dreamland (Robert Plant album)|''Dreamland'']] album.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Priory of Brion |website=www.robertplanthomepage.com |url=http://www.robertplanthomepage.com/priory_of_brion/_private/priory_of_brion.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170213001821/http://www.robertplanthomepage.com/priory_of_brion/_private/priory_of_brion.htm|archive-date=13 February 2017|access-date=4 December 2021|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn 1999, Plant contributed to the [[tribute album]] for [[Moby Grape]] co-founder [[Skip Spence]], who was terminally ill. The album, ''[[More Oar: A Tribute to the Skip Spence Album]]'' ([[Birdman Records|Birdman]], 1999), with the album title referring to Spence's only solo album, ''[[Oar (Skip Spence album)|Oar]]'' ([[Columbia Records|Columbia]], 1969), contained Plant's version of Spence's \"Little Hands\".

The song \"Life Begin Again\" features a duet with Welsh folksinger [[Julie Murphy (singer)|Julie Murphy]], emphasising Plant's recurring interest in Welsh culture (Murphy would also tour in support of Plant).\n\nIn the summer of 2001, Plant reunited with Page for both a cover of \"My Bucket's Got a Hole in It\" for a Sun Records tribute album and an appearance at the Montreux Jazz Festival, the last time they worked outside of Led Zeppelin together.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n===Strange Sensation and further collaborations (2002–2009)===\nIn 2002, with his then newly formed band Strange Sensation, Plant released a widely acclaimed collection of mostly blues and folk remakes, ''[[Dreamland (Robert Plant album)|Dreamland]]''. Contrasting with this lush collection of often relatively obscure remakes, the second album with Strange Sensation, ''[[Mighty ReArranger]]'' (2005), contains new, original songs. Both have received some of the most favourable reviews of Plant's solo career and four [[Grammy]] nominations, two in 2003 and two in 2006.\n\n[[File:Robert Plant.jpg|thumb|left|Plant and Strange Sensation at the Green Man Festival, 2007]]\n\nAs a former member of Led Zeppelin, along with Page and John Paul Jones, Plant received the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] in 2005 and the Polar Music Prize in 2006.<ref>{{cite web |title=Robert Plant and Alison Krauss |url=http://www.rounder.com/artists/robert-plant-and-alison-krauss |website=Rounder |access-date=17 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120911161103/http://www.rounder.com/artists/robert-plant-and-alison-krauss |archive-date=11 September 2012 |date=11 September 2012}}</ref>\n\nFrom 2001 to 2007, Plant actively toured the US and Europe with Strange Sensation. His sets typically included recent, but not only, solo material and plenty of Led Zeppelin favourites, often with new and expanded arrangements. A DVD titled ''Soundstage: Robert Plant and Strange Sensation'', featuring his ''[[Soundstage (TV series)|Soundstage]]'' performance (filmed at the Soundstage studios in Chicago on 16 September 2005), was released in October 2006.\n\nWith Strange Sensation's Justin Adams he appeared at the 2003 ''[[Festival au Desert]]'' held in [[Essakane]] in the [[North of Mali]],<ref name=\"Festival Au Desert\">{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-au-desert.org/index.cfm?m=0&s=2|title='Caravanes des Artistes pour la Paix' du Festival au Désert history|date=February 2013|work=Festival Au Desert|access-date=1 August 2013}}</ref> captured in a French-language documentary film entitled ''Le Festival au Désert'' (2004).\n\nOn 23 June 2006, Plant was the headliner (backed by [[Ian Hunter (singer)|Ian Hunter]]'s band) at the Benefit For [[Arthur Lee (musician)|Arthur Lee]] concert at New York's [[Beacon Theatre (New York City)|Beacon Theatre]], a show which raised money for Lee's medical expenses from his bout with leukaemia. Plant and band performed thirteen songs&nbsp;– five by Arthur Lee & Love, five Led Zeppelin songs and three others, including a duet with Ian Hunter. At the show, Plant told the audience of his great admiration for Arthur Lee dating back to the mid-'60s. Lee died of his illness six weeks after the concert.\n\nAn expansive box set of his solo work, ''[[Nine Lives (Robert Plant album)|Nine Lives]]'', was released in November 2006, which expanded all of his albums with various B-sides, demos, and live cuts. It was accompanied by a DVD. All his solo works were re-released with these extra tracks individually.\n\nIn 2007, Plant contributed two tracks to the [[Fats Domino]] tribute album ''[[Goin' Home: A Tribute to Fats Domino]]'', \"It Keeps Rainin{{'\"}} with the Lil' Band o' Gold and \"[[Valley of Tears (song)|Valley of Tears]]\" with the [[Soweto Gospel Choir]].\n\nPlant performed with Strange Sensation guitarist [[Justin Adams]] and the West African riti (a one-string violin) master [[Juldeh Camara]] for the finale of the three day [[World of Music, Arts and Dance]] Festival in [[Abu Dhabi]].
