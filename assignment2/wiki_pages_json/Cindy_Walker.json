She wrote many popular and enduring songs recorded by many artists.\n\nShe adopted a craftsman-like approach to her songwriting, often tailoring particular songs to specific artists. She produced a large body of songs that have been described as “direct, honest and unpretentious”.<ref name=WadeyP-TI-2006-03-27>{{cite news| last= Wadey| first= Paul| title= Obituaries: Cindy Walker: Country songwriter| url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/cindy-walker-471652.html| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081205180002/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/cindy-walker-471652.html| url-status= dead| archive-date= December 5, 2008| work= [[The Independent]]| date= March 27, 2006}}</ref> She had Top 10 hits spread over five decades.<ref>Exhibit, [[National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame]], [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]], [[Texas]]</ref>\n\nShe was inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] in 1997, and the Texas Heritage Songwriters Hall of Fame in March 2011.\n\n==Early life==\nCindy Walker was born on July 20, 1917, on her grandparents' farm near [[Mart, Texas|Mart]], [[Texas]] (near [[Mexia, Texas|Mexia]], east of [[Waco, Texas|Waco]]), the daughter of a cotton-broker. Her maternal grandfather F.L. Eiland was a noted composer of hymns and her mother was a fine pianist. From childhood Cindy Walker was fond of poetry and wrote habitually.\n\n==Career==\n===Beginnings===\nAs a teenager, inspired by newspaper accounts of the [[Dust Bowl|dust storms]] on the American prairies in the mid-1930s, Walker wrote the song, \"Dusty Skies\" (later recorded by [[Bob Wills]] and the Texas Playboys).<ref name=McLellanD-LAT-2006-03-29>{{cite news| last= McLellan| first= Dennis| url= https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2006-mar-29-me-walker29-story.html |title= Cindy Walker, 87; Wrote Hundreds of Songs Recorded by an Array of Artists| work= [[Los Angeles Times]] | date= March 29, 2006}}</ref>  In 1936, her \"Casa de Mañana\" was performed by the [[Paul Whiteman|Paul Whiteman Orchestra]] (as part of the Texas Centennial celebrations).<ref name=WadeyP-TI-2006-03-27/>  By the end of the decade Cindy Walker was singing and dancing in Texas stage shows.<ref name=cmhof>{{cite web | url= http://www.countrymusichalloffame.com/site/inductees.aspx?cid=196# | title= The Cindy Walker Story | website= countrymusichalloffame.com | publisher= [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070723165620/http://www.countrymusichalloffame.com/site/inductees.aspx?cid=196 | archive-date= 2007-07-23 | url-status= dead }}</ref>\n\n===Move to Los Angeles===\nIn 1940, Walker, at the age of 22, accompanied her parents on a business trip to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]. As they were driving down [[Sunset Boulevard]] she asked her father to stop the car near the Bing Crosby Enterprises building. Walker later recalled: \"I had decided that if I ever got to [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]], I was going to try to show [[Bing Crosby]] a song I had written for him called 'Lone Star Trail'\". Her father said \"You're crazy, girl\", but nonetheless stopped the car.<ref>Interview with the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', 1988 (quoted in McLellan, 27 March 2006, ''op. cit''.).</ref> Walker went inside the building to pitch her song and emerged shortly afterward to ask her mother to play the piano for her. Bing Crosby's brother [[Larry Crosby]] had agreed to listen to the song; Walker sang “Lone Star Trail” to him, accompanied by her mother. Larry Crosby was impressed and aware that his brother was looking for a new [[Western music (North America)|Western]] song to record. The next day Cindy played guitar and sang “Lone Star Trail” for Bing Crosby at [[Paramount Studios]] (where he was making a movie).  Crosby arranged for her to record a demo with Dave Kapp of [[Decca Records]], who was also impressed and offered her a recording contract.<ref name=WadeyP-TI-2006-03-27 /><ref name=McLellanD-LAT-2006-03-29 /> \"Lone Star Trail\" was recorded and became a top-ten hit for Bing Crosby.<ref name=clayton>{{cite book| last= Clayton| first= Lawrence |year= 2005| title= The Roots of Texas Music| publisher= [[Texas A&M University Press]]| page= 84}}</ref>\n\n===Performances and recordings===\nWalker remained in Los Angeles for 13 years. In 1940 she appeared as a singer in the [[Gene Autry]] [[Western (genre)|Western]] ''[[Ride, Tenderfoot, Ride]]''. The Decca recording contract led to Walker recording several songs with Texas Jim Lewis and His Lone Star Cowboys, including “Seven Beers with the Wrong Man” in 1941, which was also filmed as an early \"[[Soundies|Soundie]]\" (a precursor of music videos).<ref name=clayton/> In 1944 Walker recorded a song (not her own) which became a top ten hit, “[[When My Blue Moon Turns to Gold Again]]”.<ref name=cmhof/>\n\n===Focus on songwriting===\nWalker successfully pitched her songs to Bob Wills and began to regularly contribute compositions for recordings and the movies that Wills made in the 1940s.<ref name=malone>{{cite book| last= Malone| first= Bill C.| year= 2002| title= Country Music, U.S.A.| edition= 2nd revised| publisher= [[University of Texas Press]]| page= 173}}</ref> The collaboration was extremely fruitful: Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys eventually recorded over 50 of Cindy Walker's songs, including \"[[Cherokee Maiden]]\" (1941), \"Dusty Skies\" (1941), \"Miss Molly\" (1942), \"[[Sugar Moon]]\" (co-written with Bob Wills; 1947) and \"[[Bubbles in My Beer]]\" (1948).<ref name=WadeyP-TI-2006-03-27/> Bob Wills and his band performed Walker's first top-ten country hit, “You're From Texas” (1944).<ref name=sdut/>\n\nAmong her other 1940s hits were \"Triflin' Gal\" (top-10 records for both [[Al Dexter]] and Walter Shrum, 1945);<ref name= Whit2nd>{{cite book|title=The Billboard Book of Top 40 Country Hits: 1944-2006, Second edition|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|author-link=Joel Whitburn|year=2006|publisher=Billboard Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8230-8291-9}}</ref>{{rp|104, 314}} \"Warm Red Wine\" ([[Ernest Tubb]], 1949),<ref name= Whit2nd />{{rp|355}} and \"Take Me in Your Arms and Hold Me\" ([[Eddy Arnold]], 1950).<ref name= Whit2nd />{{rp|30}} Some sources have erroneously attributed [[Johnny Bond]]'s 1948 \"Oklahoma Waltz\" to her;<ref>Paul Wadey's obituary ([https://web.archive.org/web/20081205180002/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/cindy-walker-471652.html \"Cindy Walker: Country songwriter\"], ''[[The Independent]]''.

In 1952 [[Hank Snow]] had a hit with her \"[[The Gold Rush Is Over]]\" and in 1955 [[Webb Pierce]] had success with \"[[I Don't Care (Webb Pierce song)|I Don't Care]]\".<ref name=WadeyP-TI-2006-03-27/>\n\nAnother Walker song was \"Blue Canadian Rockies\" recorded by [[Gene Autry]] (which featured in Autry's 1952 [[Blue Canadian Rockies|movie]] of the same name). The song was revived in 1968 by [[The Byrds]] on their influential country-rock album ''[[Sweetheart of the Rodeo]]''. In 1955 Eddy Arnold pitched Walker the theme and the song-title for \"[[You Don't Know Me (Eddy Arnold song)|You Don't Know Me]]\" when they met during a WSM deejay convention in Nashville. Walker then wrote the song based on Arnold's idea, with both receiving songwriting credit for their contributions. It has been described as “a beautifully symmetrical and poignant portrait of a love not to be”.<ref name=WadeyP-TI-2006-03-27/>\n\n\"[[You Don't Know Me (Eddy Arnold song)|You Don't Know Me]]\" has been recorded by numerous artists over the years, most successfully by [[Jerry Vale]] (1956); [[Lenny Welch]] (1960); [[Ray Charles]] (1962); and [[Elvis Presley]] (1967). \"Anna Marie\", was a hit for [[Jim Reeves]] in 1957 and the beginning of another productive artist-writer association which culminated in \"This is It\" (1965) and \"[[Distant Drums (song)|Distant Drums]]\" (a posthumous hit for Reeves).<ref name=WadeyP-TI-2006-03-27/> \"Distant Drums\" remained at [[List of Number 1 singles from the 1960s (UK)|No.1 on the British charts]] for five weeks in 1966.\n\nReeves recorded many of Walker's compositions; she often wrote specifically for him and offered him the right of first refusal of her tracks. \"[[Distant Drums]]\" was originally recorded by Reeves as a demo, simply because he loved the song. [[Chet Atkins]] felt the time was not right for an international release. This demo, like many for Reeves, was unearthed upon his death and along with Atkins and [[Jim Reeves#Personal life|Mary Reeves]], Walker oversaw the production of the overdub which was to be released in 1966, and became a huge international hit. {{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nIn 1961 [[Eddy Arnold]] had a minor hit with Walker's \"Jim, I Wore a Tie Today\", a moving song about the death of a cowboy. Walker also wrote the song \"[[Dream Baby (How Long Must I Dream)  ]]\", which was recorded by [[Roy Orbison]] (who also recorded a version of \"Distant Drums\"). She originally had little confidence in “Dream Baby”, but Orbison's recording was a hit in both the US and Britain in 1962, and was a hit again in 1971 for [[Glen Campbell]] and in 1983 for [[Lacy J. Dalton]].<ref name=WadeyP-TI-2006-03-27/> In 1964 [[Fred Foster]] of [[Monument Records]] \"tempted her back into the studio to record an album, ''Words and Music by Cindy Walker''.<ref>{{cite book| last= Escott| first= Colin |author-link=Colin Escott |year= 2002| title= Roadkill on the Three-Chord Highway| url= https://archive.org/details/roadkillonthreec00esco| url-access= registration| publisher= Routledge| page= [https://archive.org/details/roadkillonthreec00esco/page/32 32]}}</ref> Walker's song \"[[In the Misty Moonlight]]\" was a hit for both [[Jerry Wallace]] (1964) and [[Dean Martin]] (1967) as well as being recorded by [[Jim Reeves]]. \"Heaven Says Hello\" (recorded by [[Sonny James]]) and \"[[You Are My Treasure]]\" ([[Jack Greene]]) were hits in 1968, both written by Walker.<ref name=WadeyP-TI-2006-03-27/>\n\n==Honors, awards and tributes==\nIn 1970 Walker became a charter member of the [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]].<ref name=McLellanD-LAT-2006-03-29/> In 1981 [[Mickey Gilley]]'s version of \"You Don't Know Me\" was a hit in the country charts.

During her acceptance speech, Walker recited some verse she had written for the occasion:<blockquote>In the 1980s, my mother bought me a dress for a [[Broadcast Music, Inc.|BMI]] affair and she said “when they put you in the Hall of Fame, that's the dress I want you to wear.” And I said “Oh Mama, the Hall of Fame? Why that will never be.” And the years went by, but my mother's words remained in my memory. And I know tonight she'd be happy, though she's gone now to her rest. But I think of all that she did for me, and tonight I'm wearing this dress.<ref>{{cite news| last= Wix| first= Kimmy| url= http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1473203/31st-annual-cma-awards-show.jhtml | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090116005230/http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1473203/31st-annual-cma-awards-show.jhtml | url-status= dead | archive-date= January 16, 2009 |title= 31st Annual CMA Awards Show| work= CMT.com| publisher= [[Country Music Television]]| date= September 24, 1997}}</ref></blockquote>\nHer speech was followed by a standing ovation and Walker left the stage in tears after softly blowing a kiss. During the proceedings renowned songwriter (and fellow Hall of Fame inductee) Harlan Howard described Walker as \"the greatest living songwriter of country music\".<ref name=BMI />\n\nIn 1998, Walker was inducted into the [[Texas Country Music Hall of Fame]].  In 2002 the [[Country Music Television]] network honored the ''40 Greatest Women in Country Music''. The women were selected for their contribution to the genre by a survey of hundreds of American artists and music historians and Walker was ranked No. 32.\n\nIn March 2006, [[Willie Nelson]] released ''[[You Don't Know Me: The Songs of Cindy Walker]]'', an album featuring 13 of Walker's well-known songs.\n\n==Personal life==\nIn her personal life, Walker shunned the limelight. It was often reported that she never married, though in an interview with ''The New York Times'' shortly before her death, Walker stated she once had “a very short-lived marriage”. After her stint in Los Angeles she returned to Texas in 1954, living in [[Mexia, Texas|Mexia]] in a modest three-bedroom house with her widowed mother, Oree.<ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.nucountry.com.au/articles/diary/april2006/080406_cindywalker_obit.htm |title= Dave's Diary - 8 April 2006 - Cindy Walker Obituary| website= nucountry.com.au| date= January 20, 2021}}</ref>\n\nWalker's custom was rising at dawn each day to write songs.
