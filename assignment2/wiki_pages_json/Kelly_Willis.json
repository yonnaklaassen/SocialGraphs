While her father was a [[U.S. Army]] [[colonel]], Willis's mother had a strong interest in music and sang and acted in amateur musicals.  Willis began singing when she was nine as a way to comfort herself after her parents divorced. After the divorce, Willis and her siblings lived with her father and moved around the country to accommodate her father's military job. She spent her middle school years in [[North Carolina]] and her high school years in [[Annandale, Virginia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.philly.com/1991-10-24/news/25812825_1_mas-palermo-kelly-willis-radio-ranch|title=Country Singer Looking for a Break|access-date=July 17, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nHeavily influenced by her mother, who used to sing in local musicals, Kelly became interested in music. One day during a high school visit to the beach, she entered a nearby pay recording booth and sang her own version of [[Elvis Presley]]'s \"Teddy Bear.\" With the demo in hand, Willis impressed her then boyfriend, drummer Mas Palermo, and joined his rockabilly band at the age of 16. The band took her on as the lead vocalist and soon rechristened the band Kelly Willis & the Fireballs.  After Willis's high school graduation, the band decided to move to [[Austin, Texas]], to participate in the vibrant Austin music scene.  After a few months in Austin, however, the band broke up.  Willis and Palermo, married in 1989, formed a new band called Radio Ranch.  In Austin, Willis attracted the notice of several influential Texas singer-songwriters including [[Nanci Griffith]] and [[Lyle Lovett]].  Griffith introduced [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]] producer [[Tony Brown (record producer)|Tony Brown]] to Willis. Brown was very impressed with Willis's vocal abilities and signed her to the MCA label in 1989.\n\nMCA embarked on a big marketing campaign to tout Willis after she recorded her first album on the label, the 1990 album ''[[Well Travelled Love]]''. MCA ensured that Willis was interviewed by several national magazines including unusual venues like ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' and ''[[Mademoiselle (magazine)|Mademoiselle]]''.  Her voice appeared in the 1991 [[Ridley Scott]]-produced movie ''[[Thelma and Louise]]'', singing \"Little Honey\" and \"I Don't Want to Love You (But I Do).\" Willis also had a small part in [[Tim Robbins]]’ 1992 film ''[[Bob Roberts]]''.  Willis appears as the young woman standing in a shallow stream in [[Dwight Yoakam]]'s video of \"[[A Thousand Miles from Nowhere]],\" as well as a member of [[Vince Gill]]'s \"[[Pickup group|pickup band]]\" in his [[Don't Let Our Love Start Slippin' Away]] video. She was also nominated for Top New Female Vocalist of the year at the 1993 [[ACM Awards]] along with [[Faith Hill]] and [[Lari White]] (Hill wound up winning the award).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.acmcountry.com/|title=winners|first=BubbleUp|last=LTD|website=Academy of Country Music}}</ref> Despite all the publicity and positive reviews from most reviewers, ''Well Travelled Love'' and Willis's subsequent albums for MCA (''[[Bang Bang (Kelly Willis album)|Bang Bang]]'' in 1991 and ''[[Kelly Willis (album)|Kelly Willis]]'' in 1993) sold modestly and received very little radio play. During this time, Willis felt uncomfortable with the way she was marketed by MCA.  In 1994, MCA released Willis from her contract.\n\nIn 1995, Willis collaborated with Jay Farrar on the song \"Rex's Blues\", which appeared on the AIDS benefit album [[Red Hot + Bothered]] produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]].\n\nWillis continued to pursue her music career after leaving MCA.  In 1996, she recorded an [[Extended play|EP]] for [[A&M Records]] entitled ''[[Fading Fast]]''.  However, her relationship with A&M was short-lived; after working with two major labels, Willis decided to record her next album on her own.  Her efforts resulted in the 1999 album ''[[What I Deserve]]'', which Willis sold to [[Rykodisc]] after finishing the album.  ''What I Deserve'' received quite a bit of press after the album's release. It was commonly seen as Willis's response to her history with MCA, and was uniformly praised by critics, becoming a hit for Willis.\n\nWillis was also a judge for the 2nd annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists' careers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independentmusicawards.com/ima_new/pastjudges.asp |title=Independent Music Awards |publisher=Independent Music Awards |access-date=July 14, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713024722/http://www.independentmusicawards.com/ima_new/pastjudges.asp |archive-date=July 13, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2003, Willis and [[Bruce Robison]], her husband and fellow country musician, released the record ''Happy Holidays'', a cover album of Christmas songs. Starting in 2005, Willis and Robison appeared in television and radio commercials for the anti-allergy product Claritin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://feedyourhabit.blogspot.com/2006/03/kelly-willis-bruce-robison-and.html|title=Kelly Willis, Bruce Robison and Claritin D |access-date=July 17, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn Fall 2007, Willis released ''[[Translated From Love]]''.

The album is co-written by Willis, Prophet and notable songwriter [[Jules Shear]], and includes a cover version of [[Iggy Pop]]'s \"Success.\"\n\nIn early 2008, Willis announced she would take an indefinite hiatus from live performances due to family obligations.  Said Willis in a website announcement, \"Being a traveling musician with four kids may not make an extremely compelling reality TV show but it is kicking my butt. I plan to continue making records. And I may do the occasional holiday show/song swap/benefit here and there.... Happy trails...until we meet again.\"   Her winter / spring 2008 scheduled dates continued as planned until the final show May 2, 2008.\n\nWillis has recently begun to tour outside of Texas again; first she headlined the Northern Rockies Folk Festival in Hailey, Idaho on August 7, 2010. Next up, she performed at the [[Hardly Strictly Bluegrass Festival]] at Speedway Meadow in [[Golden Gate Park]] in San Francisco on October 2, 2010. In 2011, Willis toured the United States with her husband [[Bruce Robison]], performing new songs in preparation for an album with Robison. The album, ''[[Cheater's Game]]'', was released on February&nbsp;12, 2013. Willis and Robison began to tour to support the release on February 13, 2013, in New York City.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bruceandkellyshow.com |title=Bruce Robison & Kelly Willis |publisher=Bruce And Kelly Show |access-date=July 14, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714222027/http://bruceandkellyshow.com/ |archive-date=July 14, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The couple followed up the success of their first album together 14 months later with the release of ''Our Year''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/ct-kelly-willis-bruce-robison-our-year-20140626-column.html|last=Kot|first=George|title=Robison and Willis collaborate on more than a marriage|publisher=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=June 26, 2014|access-date=May 11, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, Willis released ''[[Back Being Blue]]'', her first solo album in more than a decade. The album was produced by her husband.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/country/features/hear-kelly-willis-soul-tinged-new-song-back-being-blue-w518485|last=Betts|first=Stephen L.|title=Hear Kelly Willis' Soul-Tinged New Song 'Back Being Blue'|publisher=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=March 29, 2018|access-date=May 11, 2018}}</ref> The following year saw a third collaborative album with Robison, ''[[Beautiful Lie (album)|Beautiful Lie]]''.\n\n==Personal life==\nWillis married high school boyfriend Mas Palermo in 1989, but they divorced in 1991.  In 1992, Willis met Austin singer-songwriter [[Bruce Robison]]. After several years of dating, Willis and Robison married in 1996. \n\nAfter a decade focused on her music career, Willis turned to starting a family. She went through [[in vitro fertilization]] treatments, and gave birth to son Deral Otis in January 2001.  Willis's experience with raising a child led to a different sort of album than the earlier ''What I Deserve''.  In 2002, Willis released ''[[Easy (Kelly Willis album)|Easy]]''.  The album expresses Willis's contentment with her new life through songs with a relaxed, mellow vibe.  After the album's release, Willis became pregnant again and gave birth to twins Abigail Esme and Benjamin James<ref>[http://www.commotionpr.com/images/BruceKelly_twins.jpg]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070408122222/http://www.commotionpr.com/images/BruceKelly_twins.jpg |date=April 8, 2007 }}</ref> on March 24, 2003<ref>[http://www.rykodisc.com/Catalog/dump/rykoalbums_1266.asp ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070101214007/http://www.rykodisc.com/Catalog/dump/rykoalbums_1266.asp |date=January 1, 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://dir.salon.com/story/mwt/feature/2003/08/01/rockermoms/index.html |title=Mothers who rock - Salon.com |publisher=Dir.salon.com |date=August 1, 2003 |access-date=July 14, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606191622/http://dir.salon.com/story/mwt/feature/2003/08/01/rockermoms/index.html |archive-date=June 6, 2011 }}</ref> On January 10, 2006, Kelly welcomed 4th child Joseph Willis Robison; he weighed 8 lbs 14 oz and was 19.75&nbsp;inches long.<ref>[http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1520547/01112006/robison_bruce.jhtml ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930031459/http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1520547/01112006/robison_bruce.jhtml |date=September 30, 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.myspace.com/kellywillismusic |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120708182104/http://blogs.myspace.com/kellywillismusic |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 8, 2012 |title=Kelly Willis &#124; Gratis muziek, tourneedata, foto's, video's |publisher=Blogs.myspace.com |access-date=March 29, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nOn January 21, 2022, Willis and Robison announced their upcoming divorce via their Facebook pages. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/100050585345408/posts/461424962220345/?d=n| website=[[Facebook]] }}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n===Albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!
