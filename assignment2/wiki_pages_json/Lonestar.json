The group consists of Drew Womack (lead vocals, acoustic guitar), Michael Britt (lead guitar, background vocals), Dean Sams (keyboards, acoustic guitar, background vocals), and Keech Rainwater (drums). Britt, Sams, and Rainwater co-founded the band in 1992 with original lead vocalist [[Richie McDonald]] and bass guitarist/vocalist [[John Rich]]. Rich exited the band in 1998 and went on to join [[Big Kenny]] as one-half of the duo [[Big & Rich]]. Since his departure, Lonestar has relied alternatingly on session and touring musicians for bass guitar accompaniment. McDonald exited the band in 2007 to record as a solo artist, and was replaced by former [[McAlyster]] vocalist Cody Collins before returning in 2011. McDonald left a second time in 2021 to join [[The Frontmen]], with former [[Sons of the Desert (band)|Sons of the Desert]] lead vocalist Drew Womack replacing him.\n\nLonestar has charted more than 20 singles on the [[Hot Country Songs]] chart, including 9 that reached No.&nbsp;1: \"[[No News]]\", \"[[Come Cryin' to Me]]\", \"[[Amazed]]\", \"[[Smile (Lonestar song)|Smile]]\", \"[[What About Now (Lonestar song)|What About Now]]\", \"[[Tell Her (Lonestar song)|Tell Her]]\", \"[[I'm Already There (song)|I'm Already There]]\", \"[[My Front Porch Looking In]]\", and \"[[Mr. Mom (Lonestar song)|Mr. Mom]]\". \"Amazed\" also charted at No.&nbsp;1 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], becoming the first country song to do so since \"[[Islands in the Stream (song)|Islands in the Stream]]\" in 1983. \"Amazed\" and \"My Front Porch Looking In\" were the top country songs of 1999 and 2003, respectively, on [[Billboard Year-End|''Billboard'' Year-End]]. The group has recorded seven albums, one EP, and a greatest hits package for the defunct [[BNA Records]], and one album each for three different independent labels. Three of their albums have been certified platinum or higher by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). The band's first two albums were defined by [[honky-tonk]] and [[neotraditionalist country]] influences, but subsequent albums largely drew from [[country pop]]. Along with his work with the band, McDonald has co-written singles for [[Clay Walker]], [[The Wilkinsons]], [[Billy Dean]], and [[Sara Evans]], in addition to singing guest vocals on [[Mindy McCready]]'s 1996 single \"[[Maybe He'll Notice Her Now]]\".\n\n==Foundation==\nLonestar began in 1992 as a band named Texassee. This [[portmanteau]] name was derived from the fact that all five members were natives of [[Texas]], and met in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]'s [[Opryland USA]] theme park.<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p165799/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Lonestar biography |access-date=September 30, 2010 |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |author-link=Stephen Thomas Erlewine |work=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref><ref name=\"cmt\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/lonestar/bio.jhtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040202192517/http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/lonestar/bio.jhtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 2, 2004 |title=Lonestar: Biography |access-date=September 30, 2010 |work=CMT.com}}</ref> The original lineup consisted of lead singer/rhythm guitarist [[Richie McDonald]] ([[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]]), lead guitarist Michael Britt ([[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]]), drummer Randy \"Keech\" Rainwater ([[Plano, Texas|Plano]]), keyboardist/rhythm guitarist Dean Sams ([[Garland, Texas|Garland]]), and bass guitarist/lead and background vocalist [[John Rich]] ([[Amarillo, Texas|Amarillo]]).<ref name=\"oldies\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oldies.com/artist-biography/Lonestar.html|title=Lonestar biography|work=Oldies.com|access-date=June 25, 2013}}</ref> Before Lonestar's foundation, Rainwater and Britt were members of the group [[Canyon (country music band)|Canyon]],<ref name=\"irwin\"/> which recorded two albums for the independent [[16th Avenue Records]] and charted in the country top 40 with \"Hot Nights\" in 1989,{{sfn|Whitburn|2012|p=63}} as well as receiving a nomination from the [[Academy of Country Music Awards]] for [[Academy of Country Music Award for New Vocal Duo or Group of the Year|Best New Vocal Duet or Group]].
