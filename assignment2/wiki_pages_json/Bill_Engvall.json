Engvall has released a number of stand-up comedy albums through [[Warner Records]] and the defunct [[BNA Records]]. His commercially successful album is the 1996 debut ''[[Here's Your Sign]]'', certified platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]. The album derives its name from Engvall's signature routine \"here's your sign\", wherein he offers \"signs\" to people whom he deems lacking in intellect. He has toured as a comedian both by himself and as a member of [[Blue Collar Comedy Tour]], which included [[Jeff Foxworthy]], [[Larry the Cable Guy]], and [[Ron White]]. Engvall's television roles include ''[[Delta (American TV series)|Delta]]'', ''[[The Jeff Foxworthy Show]]'', ''[[The Bill Engvall Show]]'', and ''[[Lingo (American game show)|Lingo]]''.\n\n==Early life==\nWilliam Ray Engvall Jr. was born in [[Galveston, Texas]] on July 27, 1957.<ref name=\"whitburn\"/> His father, William Ray Engvall Sr., was a U.S. Navy doctor, who then went into private practice.

Other early appearances included hosting [[A&E Network]]s ''[[The Improv|An Evening at The Improv]]'' as well as stand-up routines on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]''<ref>{{cite web |title=Bill Engvall Makes His First Appearance on Network Television {{!}} Carson Tonight Show | website=[[YouTube]] |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzfDimg14Vo |access-date=19 October 2022 |language=en |date=1989-07-13}}</ref> and the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]].<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nA career breakthrough happened in 1992 when Engvall was named Best Male Standup at the [[American Comedy Awards]]. His first role as a series regular came soon after when he was cast in the ABC series ''[[Delta (American TV series)|Delta]]'', starring [[Delta Burke]]. However, the show only lasted one season and Engvall returned to making the rounds of comedy clubs and the occasional television appearance until 1996 when he was cast with fellow comic and best friend [[Jeff Foxworthy]] in the [[NBC]] version of ''[[The Jeff Foxworthy Show]]''. Signed by [[Warner Records]] in 1996, Engvall released the first of a series of successful comedy albums, ''[[Here's Your Sign]]'', based on his signature joke. The album was [[Music recording sales certification|certified Platinum]] and peaked at number 5 on the Billboard Country album chart.

And the third week of competition, Bill saw his highest score of 24 with a Paso Doble to the Lone Ranger theme song. Throughout the rest of the show, the judges usually placed Engvall and Slater at the bottom of the leaderboard, but an enormous fan base kept them in the competition, resulting in higher-scoring contestants, e.g. [[Christina Milian]], [[Snooki]], [[Brant Daugherty]], [[Elizabeth Berkley]], and [[Leah Remini]] being voted out instead.\n\nOn November 18, Engvall and Slater made it to the finals, along with [[Amber Riley]], [[Jack Osbourne]] and [[Corbin Bleu]]. The two finished in fourth place.\n\n==Comedic style==\nEngvall's most well-known routine is \"here's your sign\".
