Signed to the independent [[Big Machine Records]] label in 2005, Peck released her self-titled debut album, which produced the Top 30 country hits \"I Don't\", \"[[Findin' a Good Man]]\", and \"Isn't That Everything\". A fourth single, \"Bad for Me\", charted in mid-2007. Peck is now heard as a host on \"Y2 Kountry\" a country music radio station on [[Sirius XM]] radio.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n[[Image:Danielle Peck autographs.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Danielle Peck signs autographs for sailors during the [[Spirit of America (company)|Spirit of America]] tour, May 31, 2007]] Peck was born in [[Jacksonville, North Carolina|Jacksonville]], North Carolina, but was raised in [[Coshocton, Ohio|Coshocton]], Ohio. She is the daughter of a United States [[Marine (military)|Marine]]. Her parents both came from musical backgrounds. Her mother's side of the family traveled and sang in churches. Her fathers' parents and grandparents were steeped in country music, playing dances in the area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gactv.com/gac/ar_az_danielle_peck/article/0,,GAC_26129_4702985,00.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120903223858/http://www.gactv.com/gac/ar_az_danielle_peck/article/0,,GAC_26129_4702985,00.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 3, 2012 |title=Danielle Peck > Biography |publisher=[[Great American Country]] |accessdate=April 19, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThe first song she ever sang was [[Johnny Cash]]'s \"[[Folsom Prison Blues]],\" which she continues to perform in her live shows to this day. She wrote her first song before the age of 10. She also sang in her church, as solo and as part of a choir. At age 16, she joined a band called ''The Neon Moon Band'', which performed around the local area.\n\nAfter graduating from [[River View High School (Warsaw, Ohio)|River View High School]] in 1997, Peck formed her own band that performed at festivals and other events. She then moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], Tennessee, finding work as a [[waitress]] while pursuing a career in country music. While in Nashville, she met Clay Myers, a publisher who signed her to a deal as a songwriter with Barbara Orbison's Still Working Music. Peck soon started writing for her staff members.\n\n===Musical career===\nSoon, Peck signed a recording contract with [[DreamWorks Records]], with executive [[Scott Borchetta]]. She was working on her debut album when DreamWorks folded and Borchetta founded his own record company entitled [[Big Machine Records]], which would go on to be the record company for artists like [[Taylor Swift]] and [[Tim McGraw]].\n\nIn 2005, she released her debut single, \"I Don't\" (co-written with Clay Mills and Burton Collins). The song peaked at number 28 on the U.S. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] chart. Peck then released her [[Danielle Peck (album)|eponymous debut album]] in June 2006. The album peaked at number 23 on the ''Billboard'' [[Top Country Albums]] chart and produced two more Top 30 singles in \"[[Findin' a Good Man]]\" (her highest-charting single to date) and \"Isn't That Everything\". Also in 2006, Peck took part in a duet with fellow country singer [[Jack Ingram]] on his 2006 album ''[[Live: Wherever You Are]]'', titled \"Never Knocked Me Down,\" which was an audio excerpt from the [[Country Music Television|CMT]] program ''Outlaws 2005''.\n\nPeck released her fourth single in early 2007. Titled \"Bad For Me,\" the single (which was co-written by Australian country singer [[Sherrié Austin]]) was intended to be the lead-off to an upcoming second album. \"Bad For Me\" failed to reach the Hot Country Songs Top 40 (number 46), however, and the second album's release date was delayed until late 2008. That album, titled ''Can't Behave'', was released on December 23 of that year, though it was only available through digital retailers. The title track to ''Can't Behave'' was then released as a single in January 2009. The single, however, failed to chart altogether, and Peck parted ways with Big Machine shortly afterward.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1606224/country-rosters-remain-stable-despite-sales-downturn.jhtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305134112/http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1606224/country-rosters-remain-stable-despite-sales-downturn.jhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=March 5, 2009|title=Country Rosters Remain Stable Despite Sales Downturn|publisher=[[Country Music Television]]|accessdate=April 19, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===2007 ALCS controversy===\nIn 2006, Peck briefly dated [[Boston Red Sox]] pitcher [[Josh Beckett]]. On October 18, 2007, she was a last-minute choice to sing the national anthem before Game 5 of the [[American League Championship Series]] between the Red Sox and the [[Cleveland Indians]]. While the Indians organization stated that she was chosen because she was an Ohio native and Indians fan, it was believed that she was brought in to distract Beckett, who was starting the game for the Red Sox.<ref>[http://www.cleveland.com/tribe/plaindealer/index.ssf?/base/sports/119270858859540.xml&coll=2 Head games?
