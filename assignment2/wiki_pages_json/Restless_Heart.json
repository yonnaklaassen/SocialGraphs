The band's longest-tenured lineup consisted of [[Larry Stewart (singer)|Larry Stewart]] (lead vocals), John Dittrich (drums, vocals), Paul Gregg (bass guitar, vocals), Dave Innis (keyboards, vocals), and Greg Jennings (lead guitar, [[mandolin]], vocals). Record producer [[Tim DuBois]] assembled the band in 1984 to record [[demo (music)|demos]] and chose [[Verlon Thompson]] as the original lead singer, but Thompson was replaced by Stewart in this role before the band had recorded any material. Between 1984 and 1998, Restless Heart recorded for [[RCA Records Nashville]]. They released the albums ''[[Restless Heart (Restless Heart album)|Restless Heart]]'', ''[[Wheels (Restless Heart album)|Wheels]]'', ''[[Big Dreams in a Small Town]]'', and ''[[Fast Movin' Train]]'' in the 1980s.\n\nStewart departed for a solo career in late 1991, shortly before the band's fifth studio album ''[[Big Iron Horses]]''; the other four members began alternating on lead vocals in his absence. Innis also left before 1993's ''[[Matters of the Heart (Restless Heart album)|Matters of the Heart]]'', by which point keyboardist Dwain Rowe and guitarist Chris Hicks were added to their touring lineup. Restless Heart announced a hiatus in 1995, with Stewart continuing to record as a solo artist, Jennings joining [[Vince Gill]]'s touring band, and Dittrich forming [[the Buffalo Club]]. Stewart, Jennings, Dittrich, and Gregg briefly reunited for a tour and greatest-hits album in 1998 before disbanding a second time. They and Innis re-established the band's full lineup in 2001, after which they resumed touring and released their final studio album ''[[Still Restless]]'' in 2004. The band continued to tour and perform until quietly disbanding in 2021, shortly after Stewart began touring as a member of [[the Frontmen]].\n\nRestless Heart has released seven studio albums and two greatest-hits albums. Their second through fifth albums are all certified [[gold album|gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]. 26 of their singles have entered the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts, including six that reached number one: \"[[That Rock Won't Roll]]\", \"[[I'll Still Be Loving You]]\", \"[[Why Does It Have to Be (Wrong or Right)]]\", \"[[Wheels (Restless Heart song)|Wheels]]\", \"[[The Bluest Eyes in Texas]]\", and \"[[A Tender Lie]]\". The band has also had crossover success on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]] charts, including a collaboration with saxophonist [[Warren Hill (musician)|Warren Hill]] on \"[[Tell Me What You Dream]]\", which was a number one single on the latter. Restless Heart's sound is defined by their [[country pop]] arrangements and vocal harmony, with many critics comparing them favorably to the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Tim Dubois, October, 2019.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Record executive [[Tim DuBois]] assembled Restless Heart in 1984.|alt=A headshot of record executive Tim DuBois.]]\n===Formation and early years===\n[[Tim DuBois]], a [[Nashville, Tennessee]]-based [[record producer]], songwriter, and industry executive, assembled the band in 1984 to record [[demo (music)|demos]] of songs he had written.

This initially led to the name Heartbreak Kid getting the most votes, but after DuBois asked the band members if they were certain they liked the name, they voted a second time and chose the name Restless Heart due to it receiving one more point than the others.

The song peaked at number 33 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]],<ref name=\"whitburn\"/> making it the first country song to be a top 40 pop hit since [[Willie Nelson]] and [[Julio Iglesias]]' \"[[To All the Girls I've Loved Before]]\" in early 1984.<ref name=\"still be\">Roland, pp. 481-482</ref> Additionally, \"I'll Still Be Loving You\" reached number three on the [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]] charts.<ref name=\"billboard ac\"/>\n\nReleased third and also reaching number one on the ''Billboard'' country charts was \"[[Why Does It Have to Be (Wrong or Right)]]\", co-written by [[Randy Sharp]]. This song had been rejected from the first album and had originally been rejected from ''Wheels'' as well, due to the band considering it too similar in sound to [[Exile (American band)|Exile]]. RCA executives insisted that the band record the song anyway in order to provide more up-tempo material for the album, and Gregg threatened to quit unless they recorded it.<ref name=\"why does\"/> This song was a minor adult contemporary hit as well.<ref name=\"billboard ac\"/> \"[[Hummingbird (Restless Heart song)|Hummingbird]]\", the [[B-side]] of \"Why Does It Have to Be (Wrong or Right)\",<ref name=\"whitburn\"/> was later recorded by [[Ricky Skaggs]] on his 1989 album ''[[Kentucky Thunder (album)|Kentucky Thunder]]'' and was a top 20 country hit for him in 1990.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/kentucky-thunder-mw0000653728|title=''Kentucky Thunder''|work=Allmusic|access-date=June 17, 2018}}</ref><ref>Whitburn, p. 307</ref> The fourth and final country single from ''Wheels'' was [[Wheels (The Bellamy Brothers song)|the title track]], which topped the country charts in 1987.<ref name=\"whitburn\"/> This song was written by [[Dave Loggins]] and originally recorded by [[The Bellamy Brothers]] on their 1985 album ''[[Howard & David]]''.<ref>{{cite AV media notes |title=Howard & David |others=The Bellamy Brothers |year=1985 |type=CD booklet |publisher=MCA Records/Curb Records |id=MCA-5586}}</ref><ref name=\"loggins\">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a2WgP8q0KNIC | title=99 Red Balloons And 100 Other All Time Great One-Hit Wonders | publisher=Citadel Press | author=Brent Mann | year=2003 | page=6 | isbn=9780806525167}}</ref> The B-side, \"New York (Hold Her Tight)\", accounted for Restless Heart's third chart entry on ''Billboard''{{'}}s Adult Contemporary chart.<ref name=\"billboard ac\">{{cite web | url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/restless-heart/chart-history/asi/ | title=Restless Heart chart history - Adult Contemporary | publisher=Billboard | accessdate=May 30, 2023}}</ref><ref name=\"whitburn\"/> \n\n''Wheels'' had favorable critical and commercial reception.
