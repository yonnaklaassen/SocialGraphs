It originally consisted of Jason Albert (lead vocals), Craig Anderson (rhythm guitar), Todd Anderson (drums), Chuck Crawford (fiddle, background vocals), Mike Myerson (lead guitar), and Keith West (bass guitar, background vocals). Signed to [[Lofton Creek Records]] in 2006, the band topped the country charts that year with its debut single \"[[I Loved Her First (song)|I Loved Her First]]\", also the title track to its debut album. After their next five singles failed to chart within the Top 40, all members except Albert and Crawford left, with former solo artist Chad Austin joining. This lineup disbanded in 2012. In 2023, the band re-established with a lineup consisting of Craig and Todd Anderson, Mike Myerson, and lead vocalist Lance Horton.\n\n==History==\nHeartland was founded in 1994 by Jason Albert, brothers Craig and Todd Anderson, and Mike Myerson. They performed at a June Jam in the state of Alabama in 1997, and began seeking a record contract through the assistance of songwriter [[Walt Aldridge]].<ref name=\"cmt\"/>\n\nHeartland signed with an [[independent record label]] called [[Lofton Creek Records]] in 2006. The group's debut single, \"[[I Loved Her First (song)|I Loved Her First]]\", was released later that year, and went on to top the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts.<ref name=\"cmt\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1545692/heartland-scores-a-no-1-its-first-time-out.jhtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131031002016/http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1545692/heartland-scores-a-no-1-its-first-time-out.jhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=October 31, 2013|title=Heartland Scores a No. 1 Its First Time Out |accessdate=2008-02-07 |last=Morris |first=Edward |date=2006-11-13 |work=[[Country Music Television|CMT.com]]}}</ref> The band's debut album, also titled ''[[I Loved Her First]]'', was released in October 2006.
