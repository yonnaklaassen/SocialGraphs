This single was released as a digitally download. All participants and facilities donated their services and all proceeds from the song and music video City Of Dream-Artists for Tennessee Flood Relief will benefit the [[American Red Cross]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cityofdreamsnashville.com/ |title=Archived copy |website=www.cityofdreamsnashville.com |access-date=15 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100723134244/http://www.cityofdreamsnashville.com/ |archive-date=23 July 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref>  The Nashville Ballet subsequently choreographed \"City of Dreams\" along with several of Victoria's songs and performed them alongside her as part of their 2016 Attitude program at the Tennessee Performing Arts Center.\n\nVictoria has had songwriting success in Australia in 2019 with multi-week #1 \"Flamethrower\" recorded by [[Christie Lamb]], and again in 2019 with two #1 singles released back-to-back by Amber Lawrence (\"Heart\" and \"Hell to Hallelujah\").\n\nBanks presented \"That's a Country Song\" to the country duo [[Florida Georgia Line]] on NBC's Songland on May 18, 2020 to an enthusiastic reception from panelist songwriter [[Shane McAnally]], who called her \"the real deal\".\n\nIn February 2020, Capitol Records Nashville artist [[Mickey Guyton]] debuted the single \"[[What Are You Gonna Tell Her?]]\" (co-written by Guyton and Banks with Emma-Lee and producer Karen Kosowski) to a standing ovation of country radio programmers during the Universal Music Group Country Radio Seminar event at Nashville's Ryman Auditorium. In September 2020, Guyton performed the song on the Academy of Country Music Awards with Keith Urban accompanying on piano, making history as the first Black woman to perform an original song on the awards show.
