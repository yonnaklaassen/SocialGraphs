Eventually the family moved to [[Akron, Ohio]], permanently. When Andrews was 16 she got married. The couple had four children and later divorced.\n\nWhile living in Ohio, Andrews got a job selling carpeting over the phone for CarpetTown. She began singing in a nightclub when she was 23. Her second husband \"discovered\" her and urged her to move to Nashville and meet producer Brien Fisher of [[Ovation Records]] and begin a recording career.<ref name=\"Carpets\">{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=GSEqAAAAIBAJ&sjid=7SoEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6942,2584403&dq=sheila-andrews+akron&hl=en |title=That's a Special Voice Selling Carpets |access-date=15 January 2012 |work=The Milwaukee Journal}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nAndrews sang in a soulful type voice; she told the [[Milwaukee Journal]] after moving to Nashville, \"When I first came down here from Akron and met different people who listened to my tape they all said, 'You sound so different'. Later on they said it was good, but at the time it made me feel really bad\". One of the reasons for Andrews' unique voice was a result of surgery that removed a tumor from her thyroid.<ref name=\"Carpets\"/> Andrews revealed that after the surgery, \"They didn't tell me I wasn't supposed to sing or talk loud for a year. I started singing after the operation and it lowered on me. It used to be three or four octaves higher. Now when I talk everyone thinks I have a cold.\"<ref name=\"Carpets\"/>\n\nAndrews also said during another interview, that after the surgery, \"I started singing in a nightclub shortly after the operation and that's when my voice began to lower and lower on me. I should have been furious with that careless doctor but how can I when he is a lot responsible for the upturn of my career!\"<ref>Anderson, Ruth Nathan ''Boca Raton News'' [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lC1UAAAAIBAJ&sjid=nIwDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6621,4617390&dq=sheila-andrews+akron&hl=en Bad Medical Advice Made Sheila Andrews and Unusual Singer] (January 27, 1980)</ref>\n\n===1978 ''Love Me Like a Woman'' ===\nIn 1978, Andrews signed with the Ovation Records label.

The album's third and final single \"I Gotta Get Back the Feeling\" also peaked at No. 88.\n\nIn a review printed in [[The Ottawa Citizen]], the author gave the album a mixed review by writing, \"Andrews demonstrates a lot of potential on this album, but she has to quit being so self-conscious of her husky, wispy, voice and allow it to express more natural feelings.\"<ref>''The Ottawa Citizen'' [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=OaMyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=zu4FAAAAIBAJ&pg=1037,245657&dq=sheila-andrews+country&hl=en Recent Recordings and Notes of Interest] (September 1, 1979)</ref>\n\n===1979–1981: ''What I Had With You'' and ''Lovesick''===\nBetween Andrews' first two albums, Ovation released \"[[What I Had With You]]\" as a single with fellow label mate [[Joe Sun]]. \"What I Had With You\" was more successful on the ''Billboard'' charts than her first three singles, reaching a peak of No. 48 on the Country Singles chart.
