The band's members are Doug Phelps (bass guitar, vocals), Greg Martin (lead guitar, vocals), and brothers Richard Young (rhythm guitar, vocals) and Fred Young (drums, vocals). It was founded in 1968 as Itchy Brother, which consisted of the Young brothers and Martin, along with Anthony Kenney on bass guitar and vocals. Itchy Brother performed until 1982, with James Harrison replacing Martin from 1973 to 1976. The Youngs and Martin began performing as The Kentucky Headhunters in 1986, adding brothers Ricky Lee Phelps (lead vocals, harmonica) and Doug Phelps (bass guitar, vocals) to the membership.\n\nWith the release of its 1989 debut album ''[[Pickin' on Nashville]]'' via [[Mercury Records]], the band charted four consecutive Top 40 country singles. A second album for Mercury, ''[[Electric Barnyard]]'', did not do as well commercially, and the Phelps brothers left after its release to form [[Brother Phelps]]. Kenney re-joined and Mark S. Orr took over on lead vocals for 1993's ''[[Rave On!! (album)|Rave On!!]]'' and a [[compilation album]] entitled ''[[The Best of The Kentucky Headhunters: Still Pickin']]'' before the band exited Mercury. Orr left and Doug Phelps rejoined in 1996 as lead vocalist for the album ''[[Stompin' Grounds]]''. He also led on the [[Audium Entertainment]] albums ''[[Songs from the Grass String Ranch]]'' and ''[[Soul (The Kentucky Headhunters album)|Soul]]'', as well as ''[[Big Boss Man (The Kentucky Headhunters album)|Big Boss Man]]'' and a second compilation, ''[[Flying Under the Radar]]'', on CBuJ Entertainment. After Kenney's departure, Doug once again became the band's bass guitarist by the release of ''[[Dixie Lullabies]]'', in 2011.\n\nThe Kentucky Headhunters has released ten studio albums, three compilations, and twenty-three singles. Its highest-peaking single is a cover of the [[Don Gibson]] song \"[[Oh Lonesome Me]],\"  which the band took to number eight on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts in 1990. In addition, the band has won three [[Country Music Association]] awards, an [[Academy of Country Music]] award, and a [[Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]], won in 1990 for ''Pickin' on Nashville''.\n\n==History==\n\n===1968–1982: Early years as Itchy Brother===\nRichard Young, his younger brother Fred, and their cousins Anthony Kenney and Greg Martin began performing music in the Youngs' and Kenney's hometown of [[Glasgow, Kentucky]], in the 1960s.
