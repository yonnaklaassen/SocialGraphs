John McBride joined [[Garth Brooks]]'s sound crew and later became his concert production manager. She occasionally joined her husband on the road and helped sell Garth Brooks souvenirs.

It was produced by [[Paul Worley]] and Ed Seay.

The former was previously a Top 10 hit in Canada for [[Patricia Conroy]]. However, it was the third single, \"[[Independence Day (Martina McBride song)|Independence Day]]\", which was prevented from reaching the Top 10 through the oppositions of many radio programmers, who objected to the song's subject of a mother fighting back against abuse by burning the family home to the ground.<ref name=\"book\">{{cite book|last=Nash|first=Alanna|title=''Will the Circle Be Unbroken: Country Music in America''|editor=Paul Kingsbury|publisher=Jonathan Metcalf|location=New York, NY, USA|page=343}}</ref> \"Independence Day\" won Video of the Year and Song of the Year at the [[Country Music Association]] Awards, and has since become McBride's signature song.<ref name=\"whitburn\"/><ref name=\"cmt\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/mcbride_martina/bio.jhtml|title=Martina McBride biography|publisher=[[CMT (American TV channel)|CMT]]|access-date=November 23, 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222204741/http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/mcbride_martina/bio.jhtml|archive-date=December 22, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref> It also earned the song's composer, [[Gretchen Peters]], a nomination for the [[Grammy Award for Best Country Song]]. The song also gave McBride a nomination for the [[Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance]]. McBride performed the song at the 1995 Grammys ceremony. The fourth and fifth singles from ''The Way That I Am'' were less successful: \"Heart Trouble\" peaked at number 21, and \"Where I Used to Have a Heart\" fell short of the Top 40.<ref name=\"whitburn\"/> McBride later criticized these single choices, saying that she felt \"Strangers\" would have been a better followup, as that song was more popular with fans and later appeared on her first greatest-hits album.<ref name=\"liner\"/> ''The Way That I Am'' was certified platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA).\n\n\"My Baby Loves Me (Just The Way That I Am),\" as produced and released, proved to have a sing-along quality that led McBride to sing it that way in her subsequent concerts.\n\n===1995–1999: ''Wild Angels'' and ''Evolution''===\nMcBride's third album, ''[[Wild Angels (Martina McBride album)|Wild Angels]]'', was released in 1995. It accounted for another Top 5 hit in its lead single \"[[Safe in the Arms of Love]]\", which had previously been recorded by both [[Wild Choir]] and [[Baillie & the Boys]], and was concurrently released in Canada by [[Michelle Wright]] at the time of McBride's version. The album's [[Wild Angels (song)|title track]] went on to become McBride's first No.&nbsp;1 single on the country charts in early 1996.<ref name=\"whitburn\"/> The album's third, fourth, and fifth singles,  \"Phones Are Ringin' All Over Town\", \"Swingin' Doors\", and \"Cry on the Shoulder of the Road\" were less successful, having reached the lower regions of the Top 40.\n\nIn early 1997, after \"Cry on the Shoulder of the Road\" peaked, McBride released two duets. \"[[Still Holding On]]\", a duet with [[Clint Black]] which was the lead-off single to her fourth album ''[[Evolution (Martina McBride album)|Evolution]]'' and Black's album ''[[Nothin' but the Taillights]]'',<ref name=\"whitburn\"/> and \"[[Valentine (Martina McBride song)|Valentine]]\", a collaboration with pop pianist [[Jim Brickman]] which appeared on his album ''Picture This''.<ref>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r246721|pure_url=yes}} |title=''Picture This'' |work=[[Allmusic]] |access-date=September 13, 2010}}</ref> She also sang duet vocals on \"Chances Are\" with [[Bob Seger]], featured on the soundtrack of the 1998 motion picture [[Hope Floats]].\n\nShe had her second number one on the country charts with \"[[A Broken Wing]]\", the second single from her ''Evolution'' album, in late 1997. ''Evolution'' went on to produce four more Top 10 hits at country radio: a re-release of \"Valentine\", \"[[Happy Girl (song)|Happy Girl]]\", \"[[Wrong Again (song)|Wrong Again]]\" (which also went to number one), and \"[[Whatever You Say]]\".<ref name=\"whitburn\"/> Towards the end of 1998, the album was certified double platinum in sales by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] for selling two million units.
