Appearances at the [[Newport Folk Festival]], ''[[The Tonight Show starring Johnny Carson]]'', and New York's [[The Town Hall (New York City)|Town Hall]] increased his following and bolstered his reputation. 1966 marked the release of his debut album ''[[Lightfoot!]]'', which brought him greater exposure as both a singer and a songwriter. The album featured many now-famous songs, including \"For Lovin' Me\", \"Early Mornin' Rain\", \"Steel Rail Blues\", and \"Ribbon of Darkness\". On the strength of the ''Lightfoot!'' album, which blended Canadian and universal themes, Lightfoot became one of the first Canadian singers to achieve definitive home-grown stardom without having moved permanently to the United States to develop it. Lightfoot also recorded in the [[Nashville, Tennessee]] area at [[Bradley's Barn|Forest Hills Music Studio (\"Bradley's Barn\")]] run by [[Owen Bradley]] and his son [[Jerry Bradley (music executive)|Jerry]] during the 1960s.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.countrymusichalloffame.org/hall-of-fame/jerry-bradley |access-date=May 2, 2023 |title=Jerry Bradley |website=Country Music Hall of Fame |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220816221321/https://www.countrymusichalloffame.org/hall-of-fame/jerry-bradley |archive-date=August 16, 2022}}</ref>\n\nTo kick off Canada's [[Canadian Centennial|Centennial]] year, the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] commissioned Lightfoot to write the \"[[Canadian Railroad Trilogy]]\" for a special broadcast on January 1, 1967.  Between 1966 and 1969, Lightfoot recorded four additional albums for United Artists: ''[[The Way I Feel (Gordon Lightfoot album)|The Way I Feel]]'' (1967), ''[[Did She Mention My Name?]]'' (1968), ''[[Back Here on Earth]]'' (1968), and the live recording ''[[Sunday Concert]]'' (1969), and consistently placed singles in the Canadian top 40, including \"Go-Go Round\", \"Spin, Spin\", and \"The Way I Feel\". His biggest hit of the era was a rendition of Bob Dylan's \"[[Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues]]\", which peaked at No.&nbsp;3 on the Canadian charts in December 1965. ''[[Did She Mention My Name?]]'', released in January 1968, featured \"Black Day in July\", about the 1967 Detroit riot. Weeks later, upon the [[assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.]] on April 4, radio stations in 30 states pulled the song for \"fanning the flames\", even though the song was a plea for racial harmony.  Lightfoot stated at the time radio station owners cared more about playing songs \"that make people happy\" and not those \"that make people think.\"  Unhappy at a lack of support from United Artists, he defected to [[Warner Bros. Records]], scoring his first major international hit in early 1971 with \"If You Could Read My Mind\".\n\nLightfoot's albums from this time were well received abroad but did not produce any hit singles. Outside of Canada, he remained better known as a songwriter than as a performer, yet he was to find commercial success there before he was fully appreciated in his own country.<ref name=\"Edwardson2009\">{{cite book |last1=Edwardson |first1=Ryan |title=Canuck Rock: A History of Canadian Popular Music |date=2009 |publisher=University of Toronto Press |isbn=978-0-8020-9989-1 |page=165 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cwc4o2qntH4C&pg=PA165}}</ref><ref name=\"Marsh1999\">{{cite book |editor1-last=Marsh |editor1-first=James H. |title=The Canadian Encyclopedia |year=1999 |publisher=The Canadian Encyclopedia |isbn=978-0-7710-2099-5 |pages=1865–1866 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wR_-aSFyvuYC&pg=PA1865}}</ref>\n\nHis success as a live performer continued to grow throughout the late 1960s.

The affliction curtailed his touring schedule but Lightfoot nevertheless continued to deliver major hits: in June 1974 his classic single \"[[Sundown (Gordon Lightfoot song)|Sundown]]\" from the album ''Sundown'' went to [[Hot 100 No. 1 Hits of 1974|No.1]] on the American and Canadian charts. It would be his only number one hit in the United States. He performed it twice on NBC's ''[[The Midnight Special (TV series)|The Midnight Special]]'' series. \"Carefree Highway\" (about [[Arizona State Route 74]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona]]) was the follow-up single from the same album. It charted in the Top 10 in both countries.<ref>{{cite web |author=William R.

The lyrics in his song, \"[[The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald|The Wreck of the ''Edmund Fitzgerald'']]\", released the following year, were substantially based on facts in the article. It reached number two on the United States ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' chart and was a number one hit in Canada. Lightfoot appeared at several 25th anniversary memorial services of the sinking, and stayed in personal contact with the family members of the men who perished in the ''Edmund Fitzgerald.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ssedmundfitzgerald.org/gordon-lightfoot-song/|title=\"The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald\" by Gordon Lightfoot|publisher=S S Edmund Fitzgerald Online|access-date=January 12, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1978, Lightfoot had another top 40 hit on the United States Hot 100, a re-recorded version of \"The Circle Is Small (I Can See It in Your Eyes),\" which reached number 33.\n\n===1980s and 1990s===\nDuring the 1980s and the 1990s, Lightfoot recorded six more original albums and a compilation for Warner Bros./Reprise: ''[[Dream Street Rose]]'' (1980), ''[[Shadows (Gordon Lightfoot album)|Shadows]]'' (1982), ''[[Salute (Gordon Lightfoot album)|Salute]]'' (1983), ''[[East of Midnight]]'' (1986), another compilation ''[[Gord's Gold Volume II]]'' (1988), ''[[Waiting for You (Gordon Lightfoot album)|Waiting for You]]'' (1993), and ''[[A Painter Passing Through]]'' (1998).\n\nThe album ''Dream Street Rose'' has the folk-pop sound that Lightfoot established during the previous decade. In addition to the title song, it includes songs such as \"Ghosts of Cape Horn\" and \"On the High Seas\". It also includes the [[Leroy Van Dyke]] 1950s composition \"The Auctioneer\", a [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]]-like number that was a concert staple for Lightfoot from the mid-1960s to the 1980s. The album ''[[Shadows (Gordon Lightfoot album)|Shadows]]'' represents a departure from the acoustic sound of his guitar playing in the 1970s and introduces an adult-contemporary sound. Songs like \"Shadows\" and \"Thank You for the Promises\" contain an underlying sadness and resignation. The 1982 American released single \"Baby Step Back\" marked his last time in the top 50 in that country.\nThe 1983 album ''[[Salute (Gordon Lightfoot album)|Salute]]'' produced no hit singles; the 1986 ''East of Midnight'' album had several [[Adult Contemporary]] songs like \"A Passing Ship\", \"Morning Glory\", and \"I'll Tag Along\" (East of Midnight). A single from ''East of Midnight'', \"Anything for Love\", made the 1986 Billboard Country and Western chart.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sSQEAAAAMBAJ&dq=%22Anything+for+Love%22+billboard+country+and+western+chart&pg=PA35|title=Anything for Love; Billboard|date=October 18, 1986|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn April 1987, Lightfoot filed a lawsuit against composer [[Michael Masser]], claiming that Masser's melody for the song \"The Greatest Love of All\", versions of which were recorded and released by [[George Benson]] in 1977 and [[Whitney Houston]] in 1985, had stolen 24 bars from Lightfoot's 1971 hit song \"If You Could Read My Mind\". The transitional section that begins \"I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow\" of the Masser song has the same melody as \"I never thought I could feel this way and I got to say that I just don't get it; I don't know where we went wrong but the feeling's gone and I just can't get it back\" of Lightfoot's song. Lightfoot later stated that he did not want people thinking that he had stolen his melody from Masser.<ref>{{cite web|author=Florian BODENSEHER |url=http://www.corfid.com/gl/biography.htm |title=Gordon Lightfoot – Biography |website=Corfid.com |access-date=April 19, 2014}}</ref> The case was settled out of court and Masser issued a public apology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://storyofsongs.blogspot.com/2009/08/greatest-love.html |title=Greatest Love |date=August 29, 2009 |access-date=May 5, 2019}}</ref> Lightfoot rounded out the decade with his follow-up compilation ''[[Gord's Gold Volume II]],'' in late 1988, which contained re-recorded versions of his most popular songs, including a re-make of the 1970 song \"The Pony Man\". The original had been brisk in pace, acoustic, and about three minutes long. This new version was slower, clocking in at four minutes plus. Lightfoot performed with Canadian singer-songwriter [[Ian Tyson]] at the opening ceremonies of the [[1988 Winter Olympics]] in Calgary.\n\nDuring the 1990s, Lightfoot returned to his acoustic roots and recorded two albums. ''[[Waiting for You (Gordon Lightfoot album)|Waiting for You]]'' (1993) includes songs such as \"Restless\", \"Wild Strawberries\", and Bob Dylan's \"Ring Them Bells\".  1998's ''A Painter Passing Through'' reintroduced a sound more reminiscent of his early recordings,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Chrispell|first=James|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1-pH4i3jXvAC&q=With+the+release+of+A+Painter+Passing+Through%2C+Lightfoot+appears+to+have+found+home+and+has+turned+in+his+best+work+in+years.+Gone+are+the+uncertain+arrangements+of+the+past%3B+in+their+place%2C+there+is+a+welcome+return+to+the+essence+of+the+%22Sundown%22+musical+era.&pg=PA654|title=All Music Guide to Rock: The Definitive Guide to Rock, Pop, and Soul|publisher=Backbeat Books|year=2002|isbn=9780879306533|editor-last=Bogdanov|editor-first=Vladimir|location=San Francisco, CA|pages=654|chapter=A Painter Passing Through / May 12, 1998 / Reprise|editor-last2=Woodstra|editor-first2=Chris|editor-last3=Erlewine|editor-first3=Stephen Thomas}}</ref> with songs like \"Much to My Surprise\", \"Red Velvet\", \"Drifters\", and \"I Used to Be a Country Singer\".

PBS stations offered a videotape of the concert as a pledge gift, and a tape and DVD were released in 2001 in Europe and North America. This was the first Lightfoot concert video released. In April 2001, Lightfoot performed at the Tin Pan South Legends concert at [[Ryman Auditorium]] in Nashville, closing the show.  In May, he performed \"Ring Them Bells\" at [[Massey Hall]] in honour of Bob Dylan's 60th birthday.\n\nBy January 2002, Lightfoot had written 30 new songs for his next studio album. He recorded guitar and vocal demos of some of these new songs. In September, before the second concert of a two-night stand in [[Orillia]], Lightfoot suffered severe stomach pain and was airlifted to [[McMaster University Medical Centre]] in [[Hamilton, Ontario]]. He underwent emergency [[vascular surgery]] for a ruptured [[abdominal aortic aneurysm]],<ref>{{cite news|url=https://nationalpost.com/entertainment/gordon-lightfoot-is-happy-to-be-all-live|title=Gordon Lightfoot is happy to be All Live|date=April 27, 2012|newspaper=National Post|access-date=September 20, 2018|last1=Kaplan|first1=Ben}}</ref> and he remained in serious condition in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).

More than three months after being taken to the McMaster Medical Centre, Lightfoot was released in December to continue his recovery at home.\n\nIn 2003, Lightfoot underwent follow-up surgery to continue the treatment of his abdominal condition. In November he signed a new recording contract with [[Linus Entertainment]] and began rehearsing with his band for the first time since his illness.  Also in 2003, [[Borealis Records]], a label related to Linus Entertainment, released ''Beautiful: A Tribute to Gordon Lightfoot''.  On this album, various artists, including The [[Cowboy Junkies]], [[Bruce Cockburn]], [[Jesse Winchester]], [[Maria Muldaur]], and [[The Tragically Hip]] interpreted Lightfoot's songs. The final track on the album, \"Lightfoot\", was the only song not previously released by Lightfoot. It was composed and performed by [[Aengus Finnan]].\n\nIn January 2004, Lightfoot completed work on his album ''[[Harmony (Gordon Lightfoot album)|Harmony]]'', which he had mostly recorded prior to his illness. The album was released on his new home label of Linus Records on May 11 of that year.  It was his 20th original album and included a single and new video for \"Inspiration Lady\". Other songs on the album are \"Clouds of Loneliness\", \"Sometimes I Wish\", \"Flyin' Blind\", and \"No Mistake About It\". The album also contains the upbeat yet reflective track called \"End of All Time\" In July 2004, he made a surprise comeback performance, his first since falling ill, at Mariposa in Orillia, performing \"I'll Tag Along\" solo. In August he performed a five-song solo set in [[Peterborough, Ontario|Peterborough]], Ontario, at a flood relief benefit. In November he made his long-awaited return to the concert stage with two sold-out benefit shows in [[Hamilton, Ontario]]. Lightfoot returned to the music business with his new album selling well and an appearance on ''[[Canadian Idol]]'', where the six top contestants each performed a song of his, culminating in a group performance – on their own instruments – of his ''[[Canadian Railroad Trilogy]]''. In 2005, he made a low-key tour called the ''Better Late Than Never Tour''.\n\nOn September 14, 2006, while in the middle of a performance, Lightfoot suffered a minor stroke that temporarily left him without the use of the middle and ring fingers on his right hand.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/gordon-lightfoot-dead-1.6828991 |title=Canadian folk music icon Gordon Lightfoot dead at 84 |author=Susan Noakes |date=May 1, 2023 |website=cbc.ca |access-date=May 1, 2023}}</ref> He returned to performing nine days later and for a brief time used a substitute guitarist for more difficult guitar work.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://onmilwaukee.com/articles/lightfoot |title=Music: Stroke doesn't diminish Lightfoots skills as an entertainer |date=September 25, 2006 |website=Onmilwaukee.com |access-date=May 1, 2023}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Denis Armstrong |url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Artists/L/Lightfoot_Gordon/ConcertReviews/2006/11/12/2326377.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120710212859/http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Artists/L/Lightfoot_Gordon/ConcertReviews/2006/11/12/2326377.html |url-status=usurped |archive-date=July 10, 2012 |title=CANOE – JAM!

His first marriage in April 1963 was to Brita Ingegerd Olaisson, a Swede, with whom he had two children, Fred and Ingrid. They divorced in 1973, the marriage ending in part because of his infidelity. Lightfoot acknowledged that his musical touring and the fact that he found fidelity difficult in a long-distance relationship contributed to the failure of at least two relationships.\n\nThe song \"[[If You Could Read My Mind]]\" was written in reflection upon his disintegrating marriage. At the request of his daughter, Ingrid, he performed the lyrics with a slight change: the line \"I'm just trying to understand the feelings that you lack\" is altered to \"I'm just trying to understand the feelings that ''we'' lack.\" He said in an interview that the difficulty with writing songs inspired by personal stories is that there is not always the emotional distance and clarity to make lyrical improvements such as the one his daughter suggested.\n\nLightfoot was single for 16 years and had two other children from relationships between his first and second marriages: Gaylen McGee and Eric Lightfoot.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.corfid.com/vbb/archive/index.php/t-15235.html |title=Gord's eldest children |website=Gordon Lightfoot Forums |access-date=December 3, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 1970s, Lightfoot was involved with [[Cathy Smith]]; their volatile relationship inspired his songs \"[[Sundown (Gordon Lightfoot song)|Sundown]]\" and \"[[Rainy Day People]]\" among others. \"Cathy was a great lady,\" Lightfoot told ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' after her death. \"Men were drawn to her, and she used to make me jealous.
