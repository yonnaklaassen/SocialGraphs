In the 1980s, she recorded [[Christian music]] which garnered her four top 10 [[Contemporary Christian music|Contemporary Christian]] albums as well as two more Grammys. Throughout her career, Boone has appeared in several musical theater productions and has co-authored many children's books with her husband  Gabriel Ferrer.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Beginnings===\nDebby Boone was born in [[Hackensack, New Jersey]], the third of four daughters born to singer-actor [[Pat Boone]] and Shirley Foley Boone, daughter of country music star [[Red Foley]]. When Boone was 14&nbsp;years old, she began touring with her parents and three sisters: [[Cherry Boone|Cherry]], Lindy, and Laury. The sisters first recorded with their parents as The Pat Boone Family and later as the Boones or Boone Girls. They primarily recorded gospel music, although the sisters also released singles for the [[Motown]] and [[Curb Records|Curb]] labels that were remakes of secular pop music featuring Debby as the lead vocalist.\n\nThe Boones twice reached [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'s AC charts with 1975's \"When the Lovelight Starts Shining Through His Eyes\" (No. 25), a remake of the [[Supremes]]' first top 40 hit, and 1977's \"[[Hasta Mañana]]\" (No. 32), a cover of a track from [[ABBA]]'s ''[[Waterloo (album)|Waterloo]]'' album.\n\n===\"You Light Up My Life\"===\nWith her older sisters married and younger sister Laury in college, Boone was actively encouraged by producer [[Mike Curb]] to launch a solo career. Boone released her first solo effort, \"[[You Light Up My Life (song)|You Light Up My Life]]\" (which had been featured in the film of the same name), in 1977.

The latter single charted simultaneously with her father's \"Colorado Country Morning\" (No. 60).
