In 2015, the label released Guyton's debut [[extended play]] (EP), ''[[Unbreakable (Mickey Guyton EP)|Unbreakable]].''\n\nIn 2015, Capitol released her debut [[Single (music)|single]], titled \"[[Better Than You Left Me]]\".

In 2020, in the wake of the [[George Floyd protests]] and the [[Black Lives Matter]] movement, Guyton released the single \"[[Black Like Me (song)|Black Like Me]]\", which speaks to her experiences as a Black woman in country music.

Later that year, her third extended play ''[[Bridges (Mickey Guyton EP)|Bridges]]'' was released.
