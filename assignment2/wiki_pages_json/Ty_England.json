Initially a member of [[Garth Brooks]]' band, England began his solo career in 1995, recording a self-titled debut album on [[RCA Records Nashville|RCA Nashville]]. A second album, ''Two Ways to Fall'', followed in 1996. Three years later, he recorded ''Highways & Dance Halls'' under the name Tyler England on [[Capitol Records Nashville|Capitol Nashville]], and ''Alive and Well and Livin' the Dream'' came in 2007 on the independent Triple T label. England has charted six singles on the country chart. His highest-charting single was his debut, \"[[Should've Asked Her Faster]]\", a No.&nbsp;3 hit in late 1995.\n\n==Biography==\nEngland began playing guitar during his youth. He sang with various bands in high school, and performed in his school chorus. While working at a coffee shop during his time as a student at [[Oklahoma State University]], fellow student [[Garth Brooks]] met him and soon the two were roommates. They performed together until failing grades forced England to move back home. He did eventually get a degree in marketing, but he worked at an automotive paint store.\n\nBy 1988, Garth had moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], and after landing a recording contract, called England to come be his guitarist and backup vocalist.\nIn 1995, England left Brooks' road band and signed to [[RCA Records]] Nashville. His self-titled [[Ty England (album)|debut album]], released in late 1995, produced his first chart single in the No.&nbsp;3 \"Should've Asked Her Faster\",<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> although the album's other two singles (\"Smoke in Her Eyes\" and \"Redneck Son\") fell short of Top 40. A second album, ''[[Two Ways to Fall]]'', followed in 1996.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> It produced his only other Top 40 country hit in the No.&nbsp;22 \"Irresistible You\" followed by \"All of the Above\" at No.&nbsp;46. After the latter, England exited RCA's roster.\n\nIn 1999, England signed to [[Capitol Records Nashville|Capitol Nashville]], the same label to which Brooks was signed at the time. His third album, ''[[Highways & Dance Halls]]'' was issued under the name Tyler England. It produced three singles in \"Too Many Highways\", \"I Drove Her to Dallas\" (which peaked at No.&nbsp;53) and \"I'd Rather Have Nothing.\" Also included on this album was a re-recording of \"Should've Asked Her Faster\", as well as the [[Bruce Robison]] song \"[[Travelin' Soldier]]\", which would later become a Number One hit in 2003 for the [[Dixie Chicks]]. He did not release another album until 2007's ''Alive and Well and Livin' the Dream'',<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> which included the non-charting singles \"Redneck Anthem\" and \"The Perfect Girl.\"\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:18em;\"| Title\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:20em;\"| Album details\n! colspan=\"3\"| Peak chart positions\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n! width=\"45\"| [[Top Country Albums|US Country]]\n! width=\"45\"| [[Billboard 200|US]]\n! width=\"45\"| [[RPM (magazine)|CAN Country]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[Ty England (album)|Ty England]]''\n| \n* Release date: August 15, 1995\n* Label: [[RCA Records|RCA Nashville]]\n| 13\n| 95\n| 30\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[Two Ways to Fall]]''\n| \n* Release date: September 17, 1996\n* Label: RCA Nashville\n| 54\n| —\n| —\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[Highways & Dance Halls]]''<br /><small>(as Tyler England)</small>\n| \n* Release date: November 23, 1999\n* Label: [[Capitol Nashville]]\n| —\n| —\n| —\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Alive and Well and Livin' the Dream''\n| \n* Release date: January 23, 2007\n* Label: Triple T\n| —\n| —\n| —\n|-\n| colspan=\"6\" style=\"font-size:8pt\"| \"—\" denotes releases that did not chart\n|-\n|}\n\n===Singles===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Year\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:16em;\"| Single\n! colspan=\"3\"| Peak chart positions\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Album\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n! width=\"45\"| [[Hot Country Songs|US Country]]\n! width=\"45\"| [[Bubbling Under Hot 100|US Bubbling]]\n! width=\"45\"| [[RPM (magazine)|CAN Country]]\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 1995\n! scope=\"row\"| \"[[Should've Asked Her Faster]]\"\n| 3\n| 21\n| 2\n| align=\"left\" rowspan=\"3\"| ''Ty England''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Smoke in Her Eyes\"\n| 44\n| —\n| 41\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 1996\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Redneck Son\"\n| 55\n| —\n| —\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"[[Irresistible You]]\"\n| 22\n| —\n| 25\n| align=\"left\" rowspan=\"2\"| ''Two Ways to Fall''\n|-\n| 1997\n! scope=\"row\"| \"All of the Above\"\n| 46\n| —\n| 53\n|-\n| 1999\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Too Many Highways\"\n| —\n| —\n| —\n| align=\"left\" rowspan=\"3\"| ''Highways & Dance Halls''<br /><small>(as Tyler England)</small>\n|-\n| 2000\n! scope=\"row\"| \"I Drove Her to Dallas\"\n| 53\n| —\n| —\n|-\n| 2001\n! scope=\"row\"| \"I'd Rather Have Nothing\"\n| —\n| —\n| —\n|-\n| 2006\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Redneck Anthem\"<ref>{{cite web | url=https://tulsaworld.com/archive/all-neck/article_462edf7a-3b35-5c14-b2f8-e456adbe1a00.html | title=All neck | publisher=Tulsa World | date=February 12, 2006 | accessdate=March 24, 2022}}</ref>\n| —\n| —\n| —\n| align=\"left\" rowspan=\"2\"| ''Alive and Well and Livin' the Dream''\n|-\n| 2007\n! scope=\"row\"| \"The Perfect Girl\"\n| —\n| —\n| —\n|-\n| colspan=\"6\" style=\"font-size:8pt\"| \"—\" denotes releases that did not chart\n|-\n|}\n\n===Music videos===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n!
