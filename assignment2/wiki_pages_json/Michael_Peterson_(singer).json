He made his debut on the country music scene in 1997 with his [[Michael Peterson (album)|second self-titled album]] (following his 1986 release featuring [[contemporary Christian]] songs), which produced five Top 40 hits on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''s Hot Country Singles & Tracks, including the Number One hit \"[[From Here to Eternity (Michael Peterson song)|From Here to Eternity]]\". Peterson's second album, 1999's ''[[Being Human (album)|Being Human]]'', produced two more chart singles, and a third album, 2004's ''Modern Man'', was issued only in Europe. Peterson also made a cameo appearance on an episode of [[Walker, Texas Ranger]].\n\n==Biography==\nMichael Peterson was born in [[Tucson, Arizona]], on August 7, 1959. At an early age, he was influenced by the music that his grandmother listened to, such as [[Cole Porter]] and [[Roger Miller]].<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p215682|pure_url=yes}} |title=Michael Peterson biography |accessdate=September 22, 2008 |last=Bush |first=John |work=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref>\n\nAfter attending high school at [[Richland High School (Washington)|Richland High School]] in [[Richland, WA]], Peterson later earned a [[American football|football]] scholarship to [[Pacific Lutheran University]], where he won a national championship.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> One of his teammates, Brad Westering, was also working as a producer for [[Deniece Williams]] at the time. Through Westering, Peterson got the opportunity to write songs for Williams, as well as gospel headliners [[The Imperials]]. This all led to the production of Peterson's first release, \"Michael Peterson\", a collection of contemporary Christian songs, on [[Sparrow Records]] in 1986.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/115902637 | title=Michael Peterson | work=The Kent Island Bay Times | date=June 24, 2006 | accessdate=May 1, 2021 | pages=16}}</ref> Eventually, Peterson traveled to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], where he started working as a professional songwriter, collaborating with other writers such as [[Josh Leo]] and [[Robert Ellis Orrall]].\n\n===''Michael Peterson''===\nOrrall suggested that Peterson sign to a recording contract, and in December 1996, Peterson was signed to [[Reprise Records]], a division of the [[Warner Music Group]]. His debut single, \"Drink, Swear, Steal & Lie\", was released that year, charting at No.&nbsp;3 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country charts and No.&nbsp;86 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. It was the lead-off single to Peterson's [[Michael Peterson (album)|self-titled]] debut album (not to be confused with the Christian album of the same name from 1986), which also produced four more chart singles. The second one, \"From Here to Eternity\", became Peterson's first and only Number One hit, while \"Too Good to Be True\" reached No.&nbsp;8. Following it was \"When the Bartender Cries\" at No.&nbsp;37 and \"By the Book\" at No.&nbsp;19. The album was certified [[gold album|gold]] by the [[RIAA]] for shipping 500,000 copies in the U.S. Also in 1997, Peterson was named Male Artist of the Year by ''Billboard''.<ref name=\"peterson\">{{cite web|url=http://www.michaelpetersonmusic.com/about/index.aspx |title=Michael Peterson biography |work=Michael Peterson official website |accessdate=March 30, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201130935/http://michaelpetersonmusic.com/about/index.aspx |archivedate=February 1, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1998, Peterson appeared on [[Jenny Simpson (singer)|Jenny Simpson]]'s 1998 [[Jenny Simpson (album)|self-titled album]], singing duet vocals on \"Grow Young with You\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/jenny-simpson-mw0000044719|title=''Jenny Simpson''|work=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=April 11, 2013}}</ref> Peterson made a guest appearance on a 1998 episode of ''[[Walker, Texas Ranger]]'' called \"Eyes of a Ranger.\"\n\n===''Being Human''===\nPeterson released his second album, ''[[Being Human (album)|Being Human]]'', in 1999.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> Its lead-off single, \"Somethin' 'bout a Sunday\", failed to reach top 40, and \"Sure Feels Real Good\" peaked at No.&nbsp;39. Also in 1999, Peterson co-wrote the title track to [[Travis Tritt]]'s album ''[[No More Looking over My Shoulder]]'', which was released as a single. After a ''Super Hits'' album for the label, Peterson exited Warner Music Group.\n\n===''Modern Man''===\nAfter his departure from Warner, Peterson signed to [[Monument Records]] Nashville. His third studio album, ''Modern Man'', was to have been released in 2002 for the label. Although its title track and \"Lesson in Goodbye\" both entered the country charts (with the former being the highest-debuting single of his career<ref name=\"peterson\"/>), the album itself was not issued in the US due to a restructuring of the label's parent company.<ref name=\"peterson\"/> AGR, a European record label, acquired the album and issued it in Europe in 2004.<ref name=\"peterson\"/> Six singles were released from it in Europe, including Peterson's own rendition of \"No More Looking over My Shoulder.\" Also included on the album was the track \"Right About Now\", which [[Ty Herndon]] later released from his 2007 album of the [[Right About Now (Ty Herndon album)|same name]].\n\n===After ''Modern Man''===\nPeterson's songs have been covered by a number of artists. Though his last charting single was in 2002, he continues to release albums and performs at military benefits.\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:14em;\"| Title\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:16em;\"| Album details\n! colspan=\"4\"| Peak chart positions\n! rowspan=\"2\"| [[Music recording sales certification|Certifications]]<br /><small>([[List of music recording sales certifications|sales thresholds]])</small>\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n! width=\"45\"| [[Top Country Albums|US Country]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/michael-peterson/chart-history/clp/|title=Top Country Albums results for Michael Peterson|work=Billboard|accessdate=December 17, 2017}}</ref>\n! width=\"45\"| [[Billboard 200|US]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/michael-peterson/chart-history/tlp/|title=Billboard 200 results for Michael Peterson|work=Billboard|accessdate=December 17, 2017}}</ref>\n! width=\"45\"| [[Top Heatseekers|US<br>Heat]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/michael-peterson/chart-history/tln/|title=Top Heatseekers results for Michael Peterson|work=Billboard|accessdate=December 17, 2017}}</ref>\n! width=\"45\"| [[RPM (magazine)|CAN Country]]\n|- \n! scope=\"row\"| ''Michael Peterson''\n| \n* Release date: January 1, 1986\n* Label: [[Sparrow Records]]\n| —\n| —\n| —\n| —\n| \n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[Michael Peterson (album)|Michael Peterson]]''\n| \n* Release date: July 15, 1997\n* Label: [[Reprise Records]]\n| 17\n| 115\n| 2\n| 13\n| align=\"left\"| \n* [[Recording Industry Association of America|US]]: Gold\n|- \n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[Being Human (album)|Being Human]]''\n| \n* Release date: June 8, 1999\n* Label: Reprise Records\n| 32\n| —\n| 20\n| —\n| \n|- \n|- \n! scope=\"row\"| ''Modern Man''\n| \n* Release date: May 21, 2004\n* Label: AGR\n| —\n| —\n| —\n| —\n| \n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Down on the Farm''\n| \n* Release date: January 16, 2006\n* Label: Midnight Music\n| —\n| —\n| —\n| —\n| \n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''In Black''\n| \n* Release date: September 15, 2007\n* Label: [[self-released]]\n| —\n| —\n| —\n| —\n| \n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Grave to the Cradle''\n| \n* Release date: June 13, 2008\n* Label: Beyond Music\n| —\n| —\n| —\n| —\n| \n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Baby I'm Sticking With You''\n| \n* Release date: May 1, 2009\n* Label: Beyond Music\n| —\n| —\n| —\n| —\n| \n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''You Can Hear A Pin Drop''\n| \n* Release date: November 6, 2009\n* Label: self-released\n| —\n| —\n| —\n| —\n| \n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''We Are Veterans''\n| \n* Release date: August 30, 2013\n* Label: self-released\n| —\n| —\n| —\n| —\n| \n|-\n| colspan=\"7\" style=\"font-size:8pt\"| \"—\" denotes releases that did not chart\n|-\n|}\n\n===Compilation albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:14em;\"| Title\n! style=\"width:16em;\"| Album details\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Super Hits''\n| \n* Release date: May 16, 2000\n* Label: [[Warner Bros.
