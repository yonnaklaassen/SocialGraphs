Shields, was a [[mixed-race]] woman born into slavery in [[South Carolina]], who later lived with her parents and sibings in Alabama. The researchers were unable to learn the name of her enslaved African-American mother. Sarah and her eight mixed-race siblings were all freed in 1848 by their white father, Irish-American planter William Shields, who gained the required act of the Alabama state legislature to achieve this. Sarah, her siblings and their descendants all married white as did their descendants. Many of the extended family moved to Texas, to Mexico during the Civil War, and then back to Texas.<ref name=fdr2/>  In 1870 in Texas, Lafayette Robinson, one of Cash's direct maternal ancestors, was classified as '[[mulatto]]' on the census. With continued intermarriage with whites, descendants were accepted as white. They were classified as white in Texas in death certificates of the 1930s and the census of 1930.<ref name=fdr2/> Along with studying documents, other researchers analyzed Cash's DNA. They found she had 3.3% sub-Saharan African markers, and African ancestry on her father's side, as well as on her mother's. This was likely from the same period of slave society in the South. Gates found that Cash and actress [[Angela Bassett]] are distant relatives through shared DNA from a common African-American ancestor.<ref name=fdr2>Stated on ''[[Finding Your Roots]]'', February 23, 2021</ref>\n\n===Health===\nOn November 27, 2007, Cash was admitted to New York's Presbyterian Hospital for brain surgery.
