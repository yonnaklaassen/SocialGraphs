Recorded during two sold-out shows in November 2010 at Benaroya Hall in Seattle, Washington, the album features [[Washington (state)|Washington]]-native Carlile and her long-time band (including brothers [[Phil and Tim Hanseroth]]) performing alongside the [[Seattle Symphony]]. Andrew Leahey from [[AllMusic]] called it Carlile's best and wrote, \"'Live at Benaroya Hall' is more concerned with dressing up Carlile's music in elegant, orchestral clothing, and the results are pretty stunning, from the grandeur of 'The Story' – now featuring horns, woodwinds, and strings.
