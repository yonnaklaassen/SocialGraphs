Best known for the Slim Willet-penned song \"[[Don't Let the Stars Get in Your Eyes]]\", McDonald was a devoted [[honky tonk]] singer and songwriter whose work helped to bridge the gap between country and [[rock and roll]].\n\n==Biography==\n\nMcDonald was born on October 1, 1915, in [[Greenway, Arkansas]]. He was the youngest of his parents' seven children; his gained his nickname for calling mosquitoes \"skeets\" as a child.  When his older brother moved to [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], the early 1930s, McDonald followed; and joined his first band, the Lonesome Cowboys, in 1935. He later formed his own band and played local clubs and on radio in Flint and Pontiac.<ref name=\"SkeetsMcDonald\">{{cite web | url = http://www.oldies.com/artist-biography/Skeets-McDonald.html  | title = Skeets McDonald | publisher = Oldies.com | access-date = 2009-04-11}}</ref>\n\nMcDonald was drafted in 1943 and was stationed in North Africa and the Far East during World War II, earning a [[Bronze Star]].<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Charles K.|last=Wolfe|title=Classic Country: Legends of Country Music|year=2001}}</ref> On discharge, he returned to radio and television work in [[Dearborn, Michigan]]. He made his first recordings for [[Fortune Records]] in 1950 with Johnnie White and his Rough Riders, and cut records for [[London Records|London]] and [[Mercury Records]] as Skeets Saunders.\n\nIn 1951, McDonald moved to [[Los Angeles, California]], where he became a regular on [[Cliffie Stone]]'s ''[[Hometown Jamboree]]'' and later appeared on ''[[Town Hall Party]]''. He was soon signed by [[Capitol Records]], which viewed him as its answer to [[Columbia Records]]' [[Lefty Frizzell]] and demanded he continue releasing country songs rather than the rockabilly sound he experimented with since the war.<ref name=\"SkeetsMcDonald\" /> He recorded more than 80 numbers for the label, including his 1952 smash country hit, \"Don't Let the Stars Get in Your Eyes\" (No. 1 for 18 weeks).<ref>[{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p1722/biography|pure_url=yes}} Skeets McDonald Biography], [[Allmusic]]</ref> In the late 1950s, he appeared on ''[[Ozark Jubilee]]'' and continued recording for Capitol; his last release for the label was the album, ''The Country's Best''.\n\nMcDonald signed with Columbia in 1959 and spent the decade there, recording some excellent West Coast hillbilly, as well as some forays into the rockabilly. He employed young guitar-whiz [[Eddie Cochran]] to back him in the studio for \"You Oughta See Grandma Rock\" and \"Heart Breaking Mama\". Although they made little impact on the charts at the time, they are now considered rockabilly classics.<ref name=\"SkeetsMcDonald\" />\n\nHe scored several hits on the ''Billboard'' country chart, including \"This Old Heart\" (1960, No. 21), \"Call Me Mr. Brown\" (1963, No. 9), \"Big Chief Buffalo Nickel (Desert Blues)\" (1966, No. 29), and \"Mabel\" (1967, No. 28).<ref>[{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p1722/charts-awards|pure_url=yes}} Billboard Singles], Allmusic.com</ref> He also appeared on the [[Grand Ole Opry]] and the ''[[Big D Jamboree]]'' in [[Dallas, Texas]]. His songs included \"I'll Make Believe\", \"Big Family Trouble\", \"I Need Your Love\" and \"The Echo of Your Footsteps\". In 1964, he released the album Call ''Me Skeets!''.\n\nMcDonald made several film appearances, including ''Saddle Pals'' with [[Johnny Mack Brown]], ''[[Ma and Pa Kettle Go to Town]]'' (1950), ''[[The Glenn Miller Story]]'' (1954) and ''[[Hud (1963 film)|Hud]]'' (1963),<ref name=\"SkeetsMcDonald\" /> singing \"Driftwood on the River\" with Janet McBride.\n\nIn later years, McDonald moved his style more towards rock and roll; but refused to move far from the tearjerking songs which made his name. When told by reviewers he \"belonged to another age,\" he took it as a compliment to his dedication.<ref name=\"SkeetsMcDonald\" />\n\nMcDonald died from a heart attack on March 31, 1968, in Los Angeles.\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
