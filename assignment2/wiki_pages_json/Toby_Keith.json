During the 1990s, Keith released his first four studio albums, each of which earned [[Music recording certification|gold or higher certification]]. Keith's breakthrough single, \"[[How Do You Like Me Now?! (song)|How Do You Like Me Now?!]]\", was the title track to his 1999 [[How Do You Like Me Now?!|album of the same name]]. The single was the number one country song of 2000. Keith's next three albums were certified 4× Platinum, and each album produced three number one singles. In 2005, Keith founded the label Show Dog Nashville, which later became [[Show Dog-Universal Music]]. Keith also made his acting debut in 2006, starring in the film ''[[Broken Bridges]]''. He co-starred with comedian [[Rodney Carrington]] in the 2008 film ''[[Beer for My Horses (film)|Beer for My Horses]]'', inspired by his song [[Beer for My Horses|of the same name]].\n\nIn all, Keith released 19 studio albums, two Christmas albums, and five compilation albums, totaling worldwide sales of over 40 million albums. He charted 61 singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts, including 20 number one hits and 22 additional top 10 hits. His longest-lasting number one hits are \"Beer for My Horses\" (a 2003 duet with [[Willie Nelson]]) and \"[[As Good as I Once Was]]\" (2005).
