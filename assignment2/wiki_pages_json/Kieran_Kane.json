In addition, Kieran charted a string of solo singles on [[Asylum Records]] in 1982. After The O'Kanes disbanded in 1990, both O'Hara and Kane recorded solo albums of their own. Kane was also responsible for writing the song \"[[I'll Go On Loving You]]\" which was a top 5 country hit for [[Alan Jackson]] in 1998.\n\n==Biography==\nKane was born in [[Queens]], New York. His first musical experience was at age nine, playing drums in his brother's rock band. Eventually, Kane shifted his focus to [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]], before relocating to Los Angeles, California where he found work as a session guitarist and songwriter.<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p43302|pure_url=yes}} |title=Kieran Kane Biography |access-date=December 19, 2007 |last=Ankeny |first=Jason |work=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref>\n\nKieran moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]] by the 1980s, eventually signing to a publishing contract. He was also signed to a recording contract with [[Asylum Records]], releasing his self-titled album in 1982. This album included two Top 20 country hits.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/>\n\n==The O'Kanes==\n{{main|The O'Kanes}}\n[[Jamie O'Hara (singer)|Jamie O'Hara]], another songwriter who worked for the same publishing company, first collaborated with Kane on a song entitled \"Bluegrass Blues\", eventually recorded by [[The Judds]]. Afterwards, the two began writing more songs together, and by 1986, they decided to form a duo known as [[The O'Kanes]].\n\nSigned to [[Columbia Records]] in 1986, The O'Kanes recorded three studio albums for the label, in addition to charting seven singles on the ''Billboard'' Hot Country Singles charts. Their third album failed to produce any singles, however, and by 1990, the duo parted ways.\n\n==Return to solo career==\nIn 1993, Kieran returned to his career as a solo performer. He signed to [[Atlantic Records]] that year, releasing the album ''Find My Way Home''. Due to poor sales of this album, he was soon dropped from Atlantic's roster.<ref name=\"oldies\"/> Two years later, Kane, along with three other Nashville singer-songwriters, founded [[Dead Reckoning Records]], an [[independent record label]] specializing in country music. The label's first release was his second studio album, titled ''Dead Rekoning''.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/>\n\n==Personal life==\nKane has three children.  His son Lucas occasionally plays percussion at his performances.\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Year\n!
