Its founding members were [[Tim Rushlow]] (lead and background vocals, acoustic guitar), [[Brady Seals]] (lead and background vocals, keyboards), Del Gray (drums), Porter Howell (lead guitar, background vocals), Dwayne O'Brien (acoustic guitar, lead and background vocals), and Duane Propes (bass guitar, background vocals). Signed to [[Warner Bros. Records]] Nashville in 1991, Little Texas released its debut album ''[[First Time for Everything]]'' that year. The album's lead off single, \"[[Some Guys Have All the Love]]\", reached a peak of No.&nbsp;8 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Singles & Tracks]] charts. Little Texas charted thirteen top-40 hits between then and 1995, including the number one \"[[My Love (Little Texas song)|My Love]]\" in 1994. Their debut album earned a gold certification from the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), while 1993's ''[[Big Time (Little Texas album)|Big Time]]'' was certified double platinum and 1994's ''[[Kick a Little]]'' was certified platinum.\n\nSeals left the band in 1994 and was replaced by Jeff Huskins (keyboards, fiddle). After a [[Greatest Hits (Little Texas album)|''Greatest Hits'']] package and a [[Little Texas (album)|self-titled]] fourth studio album, the group disbanded in 1997. Seals went on to record three solo albums and one as the lead singer of [[Hot Apple Pie]], Rushlow recorded one solo album and one as the lead singer of [[Rushlow]], and Howell recorded one as a member of Hilljack. Gray, Howell, O'Brien, and Propes re-established Little Texas in 2004 with new lead singer Steven Troy; he left the band in 2006 and Howell took over lead vocals. Under the four-piece lineup, the band has recorded two albums for [[Montage Music Group]]: ''[[The Very Best of Little Texas: Live and Loud]]'' and ''[[Missing Years (album)|Missing Years]]''.\n\n== History ==\nLittle Texas was founded in 1988. Prior to the band's formation, [[Tim Rushlow]] and Dwayne O'Brien began playing together in [[Arlington, Texas]], in 1984. Porter Howell and Duane Propes got together while they were in high school in 1983 and moved to Nashville to attend [[Belmont University]]. [[Brady Seals]] and Del Gray played in the backup band of country music singer [[Josh Logan (country singer)|Josh Logan]].<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> Rushlow, O'Brien, Propes, and Howell first started making music at [[Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center|Opryland]] as a 1950s show band. With both Rushlow's first wife and Howell's wife, plus two other members, they took the show band on the road, naming their act \"The Varsities\".\n\nWhen two of the members left to pursue other interests, they contacted their old friends Gray and Seals, whom they had met while playing in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], in hopes of forging a more country/Southern rock sound. All six members eventually moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], where they started playing together. The band played at venues across the United States (around 300 dates a year), eventually catching the attention of Nashville's division of [[Warner Bros. Records]].\n\n==Musical career==\n===1991-1993: ''First Time for Everything''===\n{{multiple image\n| width1 = 108\n| image1 = Tim Rushlow 2011.jpg\n| width2 = 120\n| image2 = Bradyseals.jpg\n| footer = [[Tim Rushlow]] (left) and [[Brady Seals]] (right) were both in the original lineup.\n}}\nWarner Bros. signed Little Texas in 1989, and two years later, the band released their debut single \"[[Some Guys Have All the Love]]\".<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/little-texas-mn0000266151/biography|title=Little Texas biography|last=Huey|first=Steve|author2=Sean Westergaard |website=AllMusic|accessdate=2009-04-09}}</ref> This song, which reached No.&nbsp;8 on the U.S. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country singles charts, was the first of five singles from their debut album ''[[First Time for Everything]]''. After the debut single came the album's title track at No.&nbsp;13, \"[[You and Forever and Me]]\" at No.&nbsp;5, \"[[What Were You Thinkin']]\" at No.&nbsp;17 and finally \"[[I'd Rather Miss You]]\" at No.&nbsp;16.<ref name=\"whitburn\"/> The album was certified gold by the [[RIAA]] for shipping 500,000 copies in the US.\n\n===1993-1994: ''Big Time''===\nLittle Texas' second album, ''[[Big Time (Little Texas album)|Big Time]]'', was issued in 1993. Their most successful album, it was certified 2×Platinum by the RIAA and gold by the [[Music Canada|CRIA]]. It also produced a minor crossover hit in leadoff single \"[[What Might Have Been]]\", a No.&nbsp;2 country hit that also reached No.&nbsp;74 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and No.&nbsp;16 on [[Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks]]. After it came \"[[God Blessed Texas]]\" and their only number 1 hit on ''Billboard'', \"[[My Love (Little Texas song)|My Love]]\", both of which were also minor Hot 100 entries. The latter also featured Seals on lead vocals.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> Finishing off ''Big Time'' was the No.&nbsp;14 \"[[Stop on a Dime]]\". In late 1993, the band contributed a cover of the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]]' \"[[Peaceful Easy Feeling]]\" to the multi-artist compilation album ''[[Common Thread: The Songs of the Eagles]]''. The rendition featured O'Brien on lead vocals, with Denny Dadmun-Bixby of [[Great Plains (Tennessee band)|Great Plains]] on bass guitar and no involvement from Seals.<ref>{{Cite AV media notes |title=Common Thread: The Songs of the Eagles |others=Various artists |year=1993 |type=CD insert |publisher=Giant Records |id=24531}}</ref> The rendition peaked at number 73 on the country charts.<ref name=\"whitburn\">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2008|publisher=Record Research, Inc|date=2008|page=242|isbn=978-0-89820-177-2}}</ref>\n\n===1994-1996: ''Kick a Little'' and ''Greatest Hits''===\n''[[Kick a Little]]'', the band's third album, was certified platinum by the RIAA. Leading off this album was its No.&nbsp;5 [[Kick a Little (song)|title track]], followed by the No.&nbsp;4 \"[[Amy's Back in Austin]]\" and No.&nbsp;27 \"[[Southern Grace]]\". After the album's release, however, Seals left for a solo career on [[Reprise Records]], and was replaced by multi-instrumentalist Jeff Huskins, a former backing musician for [[Clint Black]], for their tour to promote the album.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> Huskins made his first appearance on \"[[Life Goes On (Little Texas song)|Life Goes On]]\" and \"Country Crazy\", two new tracks that the band recorded for their 1995 ''[[Greatest Hits (Little Texas album)|Greatest Hits]]''. Both of these songs were released as singles. The former became their final Top 40 hit with a peak of No.&nbsp;5, while \"Country Crazy\" stopped at No.&nbsp;44. Also in 1995, the band sang on the track \"Party All Night\", a musical track which featured snippets from a [[Jeff Foxworthy]] sketch and a sung chorus by the band. This song reached No.&nbsp;53, and later appeared on Foxworthy's 1996 album ''[[Crank It Up: The Music Album]]''.\n\n===1997-1998: ''Little Texas''===\nLittle Texas' fourth album was [[Little Texas (album)|self-titled]]. Lead-off single \"Bad for Us\" peaked at No.&nbsp;45, followed by their two lowest-charting singles, \"Your Mama Won't Let Me\" and \"The Call\" at No.&nbsp;64 and No.&nbsp;71 respectively. The band also charted that year with a cover of \"[[Kiss the Girl]]\", a song from the Disney film ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'' which they recorded on ''[[The Best of Country Sing the Best of Disney]]''. Seals also charted his only Top 40 solo hit that year, the No.&nbsp;32 \"[[Another You, Another Me]]\". Seals would record a total of three albums between then and 2003. After ''Little Texas'', the band broke up.\n\n===Hiatus and status of former members===\n[[File:Little Texas 2011.jpg|thumb|Little Texas Live]]\nDuring the band's hiatus, Del Gray co-wrote [[Trace Adkins]]' 2000 single \"[[More (Trace Adkins song)|More]]\". Former frontman Tim Rushlow signed to [[Atlantic Records]] as a solo artist that same year, releasing a [[Tim Rushlow (album)|self-titled album]]. Although it accounted for four singles, including the No.&nbsp;8 \"[[She Misses Him]]\", Atlantic closed its country music division in 2001. Rushlow then founded a second band, [[Rushlow]], whose members included his cousin Doni Harris. Rushlow released two singles and one album (''[[Right Now (Rushlow album)|Right Now]]'') on [[Lyric Street Records]], but disbanded by 2004. Seals founded the band [[Hot Apple Pie]], which released a [[Hot Apple Pie (album)|self-titled album]] and three singles in 2005, while Rushlow and Harris founded the duo [[Rushlow Harris]] a year later. In addition, Howell recorded one album in the band Hilljack, which also included former solo artist [[Paul Jefferson]].<ref>{{cite magazine | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0REEAAAAMBAJ | title=Dualtone gets Moore involved in promotion | author=Phyllis Stark | magazine=Billboard |date=November 1, 2003 | pages=36}}</ref>\n\n===Reunion===\nDuane Propes, Del Gray, Porter Howell, and Dwayne O'Brien decided to reunite Little Texas in 2004. When Little Texas reunited, Rushlow and Huskins made a legal attempt to keep their ex-bandmates from using the Little Texas name.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1470837/03282003/little_texas.jhtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040307080243/http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1470837/03282003/little_texas.jhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=March 7, 2004|title=CMT.com : Little Texas : HOT TALK: Little Texas in Court, Gilman in Transition|website=Cmt.com}}</ref> As the other four members felt uncomfortable singing lead vocals in Rushlow's and Seals's absence, they recruited Steven Troy as new lead vocalist.<ref name=\"erickson\">{{cite news | url=https://lacrossetribune.com/couleenews/lifestyles/big-time-fun-with-little-texas/article_03e1e8e1-2e8d-5956-b61a-3b1812bdf119.html | title=Big time fun with Little Texas | work=LaCrosse Tribune | date=August 15, 2007 | accessdate=November 3, 2020 | author=Randy Erickson}}</ref> However, O'Brien was critical of Troy's performance as lead singer, stating that it \"just didn't feel authentic\"; as a result, he exited the band in 2006.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/278365479/ | title=Little Texas finds way back to stage | work=The Tennessean | date=July 24, 2007 | accessdate=November 3, 2020 | author=Cindy Watts | pages=1D, 4D}}</ref> By the time the band had signed to [[Montage Music Group]] in 2007, producers for the label had suggested that Howell take over on lead vocals instead. Their first Montage Music release was the live album ''[[The Very Best of Little Texas: Live and Loud]]''. They promoted this album on the Triple Threat Tour that year, which included both [[Restless Heart]] and [[Blackhawk (band)|Blackhawk]]; touring guitarist Mark Sutton accompanied the band on both the tour and the live album.<ref name=\"erickson\"/> This was followed one month later by the studio album ''[[Missing Years (album)|Missing Years]]''. This album produced three singles, although only one — the title track — made the country charts, peaking at No.&nbsp;45.\n\nAnother studio album with Howell on lead vocals, ''Young for a Long Time'', followed in 2015.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/young-for-a-long-time-mw0002830145|title=Young for a Long Time - Little Texas {{pipe}} Songs, Reviews, Credits|website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref>\n[[File:Little Texas.jpg|thumb|500px]]\n\n=== 2004-present ===\nLittle Texas has continued to tour constantly averaging 65 shows a year.
