Artists who recorded his material included [[Blake Shelton]], [[Marty Stuart]] and [[LeAnn Rimes]].<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> His first single release as a songwriter was [[Tracy Lawrence]]'s 2000 single \"Unforgiven\", and three years later, [[McHayes]] (a duo composed of [[Wade Hayes]] and Mark McClurg) charted with \"It Doesn't Mean I Don't Love You\", which Pinson co-wrote with [[Trent Willmon]]. Pinson also co-wrote [[Marty Stuart]]'s 2003 single \"If There Ain't, There Ought'a Be\", and Willmon later charted with one of Pinson's songs, \"The Good Life\", in early 2005 from his self-titled [[Trent Willmon (album)|debut album]].\n\nAfter playing at several artist and songwriter showcases, Pinson was discovered by producer Joe Scaife, who helped him sign to a contract with [[RCA Records]] Nashville. His debut single, \"[[Don't Ask Me How I Know]]\", charted in early 2005 and reached a peak of No.&nbsp;16 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country charts. This was the first single from his debut album ''[[Man Like Me]]''. The album's second single, \"Way Down\", peaked at No.&nbsp;58, and by the end of 2005, Pinson exited RCA's roster. He did, however, re-release an independent album originally recorded in 1994 called ''I Mean Business''.\n\nDespite the loss of his record deal, Pinson continued to write songs for other singers. Lawrence charted another Pinson co-write, \"If I Don't Make It Back\", in 2006. His first Number One as a songwriter came in late 2006, when [[Sugarland]] topped the ''Billboard'' country charts with \"[[Want To]]\", which he co-wrote with the duo's members, [[Kristian Bush]] and [[Jennifer Nettles]]. [[Trent Tomlinson]] also released a Pinson co-write, \"[[One Wing in the Fire]]\", in late 2006. He released a third album, ''Songs for Somebody'', in 2007 on an independent label. This album included his own rendition of \"If I Don't Make It Back\". That same year, two more songs that he co-wrote entered the charts: \"What I Did Last Night\" by [[Catherine Britt]] and \"[[We Weren't Crazy (song)|We Weren't Crazy]]\" by [[Josh Gracin]].\n\nIn 2008, Pinson also began writing with [[Toby Keith]], including the singles \"[[She's a Hottie]]\", \"[[She Never Cried in Front of Me]]\", \"[[Lost You Anyway]]\", \"[[Made in America (Toby Keith song)|Made in America]]\", \"[[Beers Ago]]\", \"[[I Like Girls That Drink Beer]]\" and \"Shut Up and Hold On\". \"35 MPH Town\". \"She Never Cried in Front of Me\" and \"Lost You Anyway\" were released from Keith's 2008 album ''[[That Don't Make Me a Bad Guy]]'', on which all but three songs were co-written by Keith and Pinson. He also has several cuts on Sugarland's 2008 album ''[[Love on the Inside]]'', including its first three singles: \"[[All I Want to Do (Sugarland song)|All I Want to Do]]\", \"[[Already Gone (Sugarland song)|Already Gone]]\" and \"[[It Happens]]\", all of which were also Number One hits.
