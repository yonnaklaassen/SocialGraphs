Active since 1996, he has released a total of seven studio albums: one on the former [[River North Records]], one on [[Universal Music Group Nashville|Mercury Nashville]], and five independently. Azar has charted nine times on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]], most successfully with his late 2001-early 2002 hit \"[[I Don't Have to Be Me ('til Monday)]]\", which reached the number two position there. After leaving Mercury in 2005, Azar began recording independently; ''[[Slide On Over Here]]'', his second independently-released album, charted the top-40 country singles \"Moo La Moo\" and \"[[Sunshine (Everybody Needs a Little)]]\" in 2009.\n\nIn addition to these albums, Azar released a number of standalone songs including a song to promote the [[National FFA Organization]] and a jingle for [[McDonald's]] restaurants. His 2017 album ''Down at the Liquor Store'' featured a number of guest musicians who had previously played for [[B. B. King]] and [[Elvis Presley]], and was credited to Steve Azar and the King's Men. Azar has written most of his own songs, and his style draws from country, rock, and [[Delta blues]], with his singing voice gaining frequent comparisons to [[John Mellencamp]]. In addition to his albums, Azar has also hosted a number of charities and music festivals. In 2017, he was named Music and Cultural Ambassador of Mississippi by that state's then-governor [[Phil Bryant]].\n\n==Biography==\nStephen Thomas Azar was born April 11, 1964, as one of five children born to couple Joe and Virgie Azar, descendants of [[Lebanese Americans|Lebanese]]/[[Syrian Americans|Syrian]] immigrants, in [[Greenville, Mississippi]].<ref name=\"whitburn\"/><ref name=\"comes home\">{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/282735490/ | title=Delta musician comes home | date=September 9, 2002 | access-date=January 16, 2021 | author=Rebecca Hood Adams | location=Clarksdale, Mississippi | pages=1, 2}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Hollabaugh |first=Lorie |date=2017-08-04 |title=Steve Azar Brings In B.B.

B. King]], [[Conway Twitty]], and [[Neil Diamond]] to be primary musical influences. Pettus also wrote that \"[w]hile the tunes themselves don't mimic the [[blues]] riffs Azar absorbed growing up in the [[Mississippi Delta|Delta]], the intensity and passion of his playing does.\"<ref name=\"gary\"/> Azar also noted that both blues and country were influential in forming his style. He told CMT in 2002 that \"Country music to me has always been about real life and real things and real people and real life situations, a lot like the blues was. I’m not a blues man, I didn’t live their life. I grew up around it\".<ref name=\"cmt 1\"/> As Azar largely writes his own songs, he has stated that he can \"only write what I know, and I know the Delta\". In particular, he said that his uncle Joe Nosef, a former mayor of Clarksdale, Mississippi who died of cancer at age 35, was one of the main inspirations behind \"Waitin' on Joe\".<ref name=\"comes home\"/> Azar's singing voice has been compared to that of [[John Mellencamp]],<ref name=\"larry\"/><ref name=\"bb heartbreak\"/> with Ben Scott of ''The Oklahoman'' calling him a \"younger, less jaded\" variant of the same.<ref name=\"okla\"/> Matt Bjorke of Roughstock called Azar's voice \"buttery-smooth\" and \"soulful\", comparing him positively to [[John Hiatt]].<ref name=\"bjorke\"/>\n\nAzar's musical representation of Mississippi has led to honors by two different state governors: [[Ronnie Musgrove]] declared March 13 \"Steve Azar Day\" to reflect Azar's positive portrayals of the state in the music videos for \"I Don't Have to Be Me\" and \"Waitin' on Joe\",<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cmt.com/news/1470438/mississippi-declares-steve-azar-day/ | title=Mississippi Declares Steve Azar Day | work=CMT | date=March 7, 2003 | access-date=January 16, 2011}}{{dead link|date=July 2024|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> while [[Phil Bryant]] named him Music and Cultural Ambassador of Mississippi in 2017.<ref name=\"delta\"/> The latter also requested that Azar write a song to honor the state's bicentennial in 2017.
