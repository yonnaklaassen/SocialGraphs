He has recorded three studio albums: 1999's ''Love Trip'' on the [[Virgin Records]] label. 2007's ''Loaded & Empty'' and 2012's ''Telephone, TX'' were released on his personal Nic-Nic-Neer label. The first album produced three chart singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country music charts, including a Top 40 in its title track. In addition, Kilgore has written singles for [[Tracy Byrd]], [[John Michael Montgomery]] and [[Clay Walker]].\n\n==Biography==\nKilgore got his start playing various bars throughout the [[Portland, Oregon]] area, subsequently moving to [[Mesa, Arizona]] and later to [[North Carolina]] before he moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. Eventually, he found a deal as a songwriter, and in 1995, [[Tracy Byrd]] entered Top 10 on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Singles & Tracks]] with \"[[Love Lessons (song)|Love Lessons]]\", which Kilgore co-wrote. Kilgore also signed to [[Asylum Records]] in 1997 but did not record anything for the label.<ref name=\"google\">{{cite book|title=Billboard|date=April 19, 1997|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|issn=0006-2510|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9w4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA99|page=99|accessdate=August 21, 2015}}</ref> Kilgore revealed on Irish Country Music channel, Keep It Country TV, in an interview with Tommy Rosney that he did record an un-released album for Asylum Records that was produced by [[Randy Travis]] producer [[Kyle Lehning]]\nIn 1998, [[John Michael Montgomery]] also had a top 5 country hit with \"[[Cover You in Kisses]]\", another song co-written by Kilgore.<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p374008|pure_url=yes}} |title=allmusic ((( Jerry Kilgore > Biography))) |accessdate=November 10, 2007 |last=Ruhlman |first=William |work=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref><ref name=\"scene\"/> A year later, Kilgore was signed to [[Virgin Records]] as a recording artist, becoming the first artist signed to the label's Nashville division.<ref name=\"scene\">{{cite web |url=http://weeklywire.com/ww/11-01-99/nash_music-industry.html |title=Back to Basics: Nashville label takes its time breaking traditional artist |accessdate=November 10, 2007 |last=Keel |first=Beverly |date=November 1, 1999 |work=Nashville Scene}}</ref> His debut album ''Love Trip'' was released that year,<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> and its title track was a Top 40 hit on the country charts in late 1999.

He co-wrote [[Clay Walker]]'s 2001 single \"[[If You Ever Feel Like Lovin' Me Again]]\".\n\nIn 2007 (''Loaded & Empty'') and 2012 (''Telephone, TX''), Kilgore released independent CDs on Nic-Nic-Neer Records, .\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:10em;\"| Title\n! style=\"width:20em;\"| Album details\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[Love Trip]]''\n|\n* Release date: September 21, 1999\n* Label: [[Virgin Records]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Loaded & Empty''\n|\n* Release date: March 18, 2008\n* Label: Nic-Nic Neer Records\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Telephone, TX''\n|\n* Release date: March 31, 2012\n* Label: Nic-Nic Neer Records\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Those Seven Years''\n|\n* Release date: July 16, 2014\n* Label: Nic-Nic Neer Records\n|}\n\n===Singles===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Year\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:20em;\"| Single\n! colspan=\"2\"| Peak chart<br />positions\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Album\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n! width=\"45\"| [[Hot Country Songs|US Country]]\n! width=\"45\"| [[RPM (magazine)|CAN Country]]\n|-\n| 1999\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Love Trip\"\n| 36\n| 64\n| align=\"left\" rowspan=\"3\"| ''Love Trip''\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 2000\n! scope=\"row\"| \"The Look\"\n| 49\n| —\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Cactus in a Coffee Can\"\n| 73\n| —\n|-\n| 2008\n! scope=\"row\"| \"What's It Take to Get a Drink in Here\"\n| —\n| —\n| align=\"left\"| ''Loaded & Empty''\n|-\n|-\n| 2011\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Places to Go\"\n| —\n| —\n| align=\"left\"| ''Telephone, TX''\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" style=\"font-size:8pt\"| \"—\" denotes releases that did not chart\n|-\n|}\n\n===Music videos===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n!
