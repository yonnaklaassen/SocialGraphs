G. Sheppard'''.  He had 14 number-one hits on the US country charts between 1974 and 1986, including eight consecutive number ones between 1980 and 1982.\n\n==Early life==\nBrowder was born in [[Humboldt, Tennessee]], United States.<ref name=\"whitburn\">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2008|publisher=Record Research, Inc|year=2008|pages=379–380|isbn=978-0-89820-177-2}}</ref> He dropped out of high school at age 15 and ran away from home to become involved in the [[music industry]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]].\n\n==Career==\nWilliam Browder, as he was then known, first recorded for [[Atco Records]] as Brian Stacy in 1966.<ref name=\"whitburn\"/> Browder worked as an executive at RCA during the early 1970s, but in 1974, signed with Melodyland (later Hitsville) Records, a short-lived country label owned by [[Motown Records]]. He used the stage name T.G. Sheppard to avoid jeopardizing his job with RCA, due to his recording material with a different label.  According to Browder, \"The T.G. in my stage name is really and truly just initials.  A lot of people through the years have had fun putting what they want the initials to stand for, but they really don't mean anything, they are just initials.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourbrowncounty.com/0302s6.htm |title=T.G. Sheppard |website=Ourbrowncounty.com |date=October 19, 1999 |access-date=April 29, 2020}}</ref>\n\nHe recorded the song \"[[Devil in the Bottle]]\", which became a No.&nbsp;1 [[hit song|hit]] on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'s'' [[Hot Country Singles & Tracks|Hot Country Singles]] [[record chart|chart]] and also became a top 60 Pop hit in 1975.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> The follow-up, \"Tryin' to Beat the Morning Home\", also went to No.&nbsp;1 and cracked the top 100 during the summer of 1975.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> Several subsequent releases during 1975–77 made the [[Top 40|top 10]] like \"Motels and Memories\" and \"Show Me a Man\".\n\nIn 1977, Sheppard signed with [[Warner Bros. Records]]. Starting with that summer's \"When Can We Do This Again\", he had a series of fifteen consecutive top 10 releases, including 10 No.&nbsp;1 songs. The biggest included \"[[Last Cheater's Waltz]]\" (1979); \"[[I'll Be Coming Back for More]]\" and \"[[Do You Wanna Go to Heaven]]\" (1980); \"[[I Loved 'Em Every One]]\" and \"[[Party Time (T.G. Sheppard song)|Party Time]]\" (1981); \"[[Only One You]]\", \"[[Finally (T.G. Sheppard song)|Finally]]\", and \"[[War Is Hell (On the Homefront Too)]]\" (1982). Another major hit came in 1984: \"[[Slow Burn (T.G. Sheppard song)|Slow Burn]]\". \"I Loved 'Em Every One\" also reached the top forty on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100]]. In 1984 he recorded, as a duet with [[Judy Collins]], the title track of ''[[Home Again (Judy Collins album)|Home Again]]'', her final album for Elektra Records.\n\nIn 1985, he moved from Warner Bros. to [[Columbia Records]]. After just missing the top 20 with \"Fooled Around and Fell in Love\" (a remake of the [[Elvin Bishop]] hit), he returned to the top 10, with his biggest success during this time frame coming with 1986's \"[[Strong Heart (T.G. Sheppard song)|Strong Heart]]\" (the last of his No.&nbsp;1 hits, as it turned out). Three more songs peaked at No.&nbsp;2 in 1987: \"Half Past Forever (Till I'm Blue in the Heart)\", \"You're My First Lady\", and \"One for the Money\".\n\nSheppard's success continued until about 1988, when rootsy [[Neotraditional country|neo-traditionalist]] artists began to eclipse more polished pop-country artists. In 1995, he took a two-year hiatus from the road to perform exclusively for eight months a year at T.G. Sheppard's Theater in the Smokies, a state-of-the-art theater in the heart of the Great Smoky Mountains. When the theater was sold in 1997, he returned to the road. He continued to tour and play throughout the 1990s, but did not sign a new record contract, and did not release any new material until 1997. His 2002 live release, ''T.G. Sheppard: Live at [[Billy Bob's]]'', found Sheppard performing his classic hits for an enthusiastic crowd at the famed honky tonk in [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]], Texas. Sheppard released ''Timeless'' in 2004, an album that had him singing songs from the big band era. In the mid to late 1980s, he was an associate sponsor on the No.&nbsp;25 [[Folgers]] [[Chevrolet]] driven on the [[NASCAR Cup Series]] by [[Tim Richmond]] and [[Ken Schrader]]. In 1990, the Folgers sponsorship moved to Roush racing and driver [[Mark Martin]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Roush Fenway Racing |url=https://www.topspeed.com/racing/nascar-series/nextel-cup/nascar-nextel-cup-teams/roush-fenway-racing-ar44657.html |website=topspeed.com |access-date=June 19, 2019 |date=October 2, 2007}}</ref>\n\nT.G. Sheppard currently tours throughout the year and, after a two-decade hiatus, he released a new single \"I Wanna Live Like Elvis\" in January 2019 with a new album set to be released at a later date.<ref>{{cite web |title=Priscilla Presley Embraces New Single |url=https://www.mynewsletterbuilder.com/email/newsletter/1413784182 |website=mynewsletterbuilder.com |access-date=July 19, 2019 |date=January 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\nSheppard was a friend of [[Elvis Presley]]'s and hosts his own show on [[Sirius XM]]'s Elvis Radio.
