The group was founded in 1989 through the assistance of record producer [[Tony Brown (record producer)|Tony Brown]]. McBride & the Ride's first three albums&nbsp;— ''[[Burnin' Up the Road]]'', the [[gold album|gold]]-certified ''[[Sacred Ground (McBride & the Ride album)|Sacred Ground]]'', and ''[[Hurry Sundown (McBride & the Ride album)|Hurry Sundown]]'', released in 1991, 1992, and 1993, respectively&nbsp;— were all issued on [[Universal Music Group Nashville|MCA Nashville]]. These albums also produced several hits on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country charts, including the Top 5 hits \"[[Sacred Ground (song)|Sacred Ground]]\" (their highest-peaking, at No. 2), \"[[Going Out of My Mind]]\", \"[[Just One Night (McBride & the Ride song)|Just One Night]]\", and \"[[Love on the Loose, Heart on the Run]]\".\n\nIn 1994, the label removed Herndon and Thomas from the group, which was renamed '''Terry McBride & the Ride'''. McBride remained lead singer, while the other members were replaced with Keith Edwards (drums), Kenny Vaughan (electric guitar), Gary Morse (steel guitar), Jeff Roach (keyboards), and Randy Frazier (bass guitar), formerly of the band [[Palomino Road]]. Roach and Vaughan were respectively replaced by Rick Gerken and Bob Britt shortly before their fourth album (1994's ''[[Terry McBride & the Ride]]''), after which McBride & the Ride disbanded. During the hiatus, MCA issued a compilation called ''Country's Best'', while McBride and Herndon wrote singles for other artists. McBride, Thomas, and Herndon reunited as McBride & the Ride in 2000, releasing ''[[Amarillo Sky (album)|Amarillo Sky]]'' on [[Dualtone Records]] in 2002 before splitting up again. McBride later joined the backing band for the duo [[Brooks & Dunn]] and continued to write singles for other artists, while Herndon self-released a solo album, and Thomas joined [[The Time Jumpers]]. McBride & the Ride re-established a second time in 2021.\n\n==History==\nMcBride & the Ride was created in 1989 when [[Tony Brown (record producer)|Tony Brown]], then the executive vice president of [[MCA Records]], decided to establish a new country music band in order to compete with [[Alabama (American band)|Alabama]], who he thought was falling out of favor with country radio.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/><ref name=\"oldies\">{{cite web |url=http://www.oldies.com/artist-view/McBride-Ride.html|title=McBride & the Ride Biography |access-date=2007-07-18 |work=Oldies.com}}</ref> At the time, guitarist Ray Herndon (born July 14, 1960) was serving as a backing musician for [[Lyle Lovett]], then a recording artist for MCA. Brown suggested that Herndon join lead vocalist [[Terry McBride (musician)|Terry McBride]] (born September 16, 1958), whom Herndon did not yet know, in the new band that Brown had planned.<ref name=\"ray\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1495826/20050112/mcbride_the_ride.jhtml |title=Ray Herndon ready for the spotlight |access-date=2007-07-18 |work=[[Country Music Television|CMT]]}}</ref> McBride, a musician since childhood, had worked as a backing musician for his father, [[Dale McBride]], and later for [[Delbert McClinton]] and [[Rosie Flores]].<ref name=\"iac\">{{cite web |url=http://www.iacmusic.com/artist.aspx?id=26622 |title=McBride & the Ride |access-date=2008-08-02 |work=Independent Artists Company}}</ref> At the Fan Fair (now [[CMA Music Festival]]) in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], Brown introduced McBride and Herndon to drummer Billy Thomas (born October 24, 1953), who had previously played for [[Emmylou Harris]] and [[Mac Davis]], and the band's lineup was in place.<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p5969|pure_url=yes}} |title=McBride & the Ride Biography |access-date=2007-07-18 |last=Brennan |first=Sandra  |work=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref><ref name=\"ray\"/> Brown had also chosen steel guitarist Steve Fishell to be a fourth member, but Fishell declined and chose to work as a record producer instead.

Its followup, \"Every Step of the Way\", failed to chart in both countries. The band was almost dropped from MCA's roster due to poor chart performance, until the release of \"[[Can I Count on You]]\", which peaked at number 15 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country charts and was made into a [[music video]].<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> This song's success led to the release of McBride & the Ride's 1991 debut album ''[[Burnin' Up the Road]]'', on which McBride co-wrote all but one of the songs.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> The last single from this album, \"[[Same Old Star]]\", peaked at number 28.
