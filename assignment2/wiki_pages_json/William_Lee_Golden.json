The [[Federal architecture|Federal-style]] structure was built in 1786, then called \"Pilot's Knob,\" on a military outpost by [[American Revolutionary War]] Captain James Franklin, the father of planter and slave trader [[Isaac Franklin]] (1789–1846). After the war, he was awarded a land grant to the property.\n\nDuring the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], the Plantation became a station camp for [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] soldiers. In order to protect their valuable gold and silver from approaching [[Union Army|Union]] soldiers, the occupants buried the metals in the ground surrounding the house. This gold was later discovered during renovation of the home in 1976.\n\nThe area has been struck twice by [[tornado]]es; once in 1892 and again on [[April 6–8, 2006 Tornado Outbreak|April 6, 2006]]. Originally a two-story building, the second story was removed by the first tornado. Repairs were made leaving it as a single-story home. Following the second tornado, the home's architecture was restored, adding a second story. William Lee Golden still resides at Golden Era. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://yoursumner.com/passing-on-the-torch-for-a-golden-era/ |title=Passing on the Torch for a Golden Era - YourSumner |website=yoursumner.com |access-date=13 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311093132/http://yoursumner.com/passing-on-the-torch-for-a-golden-era/ |archive-date=11 March 2016 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== Discography ==\n=== Albums ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
