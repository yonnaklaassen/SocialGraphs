That album was followed by 2001's ''[[Tiger Army II: Power of Moonlite]]'', 2004's ''[[Tiger Army III: Ghost Tigers Rise]]'' and 2007's ''[[Music from Regions Beyond]]'' before leaving the label. Their latest album, ''[[V •••–]]'', was released in 2016 on [[Luna Tone Records]]/[[Rise Records]].\n\n===Solo career===\nIn an interview, Nick 13 was asked why the sole songwriter for a band would launch a solo career.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.altpress.com/features/entry/qa_nick_13_on_tiger_armys_14th_anniversary/|title=Nick 13 On Tiger Army's 14th Anniversary |date=April 7, 2010|accessdate=December 14, 2010 | work=Alternative Press}}</ref> \"The first person to give me the idea of a primary songwriter making a solo record was Paul Fenech of [[The Meteors]],\" he said. \"I always thought there was something cool about that: You write all the songs for the band, and there's a certain sound people expect. But while Tiger Army has always tested those kinds of boundaries, there are certain things that relate to heaviness and aggression that aren't part of my solo project, at all.\" When asked about the status of Tiger Army, he said, \"Tiger Army aren't going anywhere—we will be back.\" \n\nHis first full performance as a solo artist was at the [[Stagecoach Festival]] in Indio, California, in spring, 2010, where he opened for [[Merle Haggard]] and [[Ray Price (musician)|Ray Price]]. A handful of small club dates in California followed, leading up to an appearance at the Hootenanny Festival in Orange County just before [[Chuck Berry]].
