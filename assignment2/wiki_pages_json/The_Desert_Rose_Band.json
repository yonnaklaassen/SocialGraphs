The original lineup included Bill Bryson on bass guitar, [[JayDee Maness]]<!--not \"Jay Dee\"--> on [[pedal steel guitar]], and Steve Duncan on drums. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the band charted several hit singles on the US ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Singles & Tracks]] charts until disbanding in February 1994.<ref name=\"Larkin\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|pages=365/6}}</ref>\n\n==Formation==\nThe Desert Rose Band was formed in 1985 by frontman [[Chris Hillman]] (born December 4, 1944), formerly a member of [[The Byrds]], and co-founder, along with the late [[Gram Parsons]] of the country-rock band [[The Flying Burrito Brothers]]. Additional members included [[John Jorgenson]] (born July 6, 1956), who was mainly responsible for the instrumental arrangements of the songs, and [[Herb Pedersen]] (born April 27, 1944), responsible for the vocal arrangements. Jorgenson and Pedersen sang three-part harmony with Hillman. Each Desert Rose Band album featured Pedersen on one lead vocal. Pedal steel player [[JayDee Maness]]<!--not \"Jay Dee\"--> (born January 4, 1945), drummer Steve Duncan (born July 28, 1953), and bassist Bill Bryson (1946–2017) rounded out the group.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>\n\n==Career==\n===1987-1989: ''The Desert Rose Band'' and ''Running''===\nTheir [[The Desert Rose Band (album)|eponymous]] debut album was issued in 1987 on [[MCA Records|MCA]]/[[Curb Records|Curb]].<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> It contained their first hit \"Ashes of Love\", which was originally a [[Johnnie & Jack]] song from the early 1950s. It was the second time Hillman and Pedersen recorded \"Ashes of Love,\" the first being on Hillman's just prior album ''Desert Rose'' on the Sugar Hill label. The Desert Rose Band's debut also featured a remake of Chris Hillman's \"Time Between\" which he previously wrote and recorded as a member of the Byrds,<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> as well as the band's first chart-topper \"[[He's Back and I'm Blue]]\".\n\nTheir second album ''[[Running (The Desert Rose Band album)|Running]]'' (1988) featured the [[John Hiatt]]-penned hit \"[[She Don't Love Nobody]]\", \"Running\", and a remake of Buck Owens's \"Hello Trouble\".<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>\n\n===1990-1993: ''Pages of Life'', ''True Love'' and ''Life Goes On''===\nThe third album ''[[Pages of Life (album)|Pages of Life]]'' (1990)<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> featured a remake of \"Desert Rose\" as well as a remake of Pedersen's folk song about his daughter \"Our Baby's Gone\" which was originally recorded on his 1976 album ''Southwest''. JayDee<!--not \"Jay Dee\"--> Maness left the band in 1990 and was replaced on pedal steel guitar by [[Tom Brumley]] whom Jay Dee replaced in the Buckaroos.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Maness would again play with Chris Hillman and Herb Pedersen on their post Desert Rose Band duo albums ''Bakersfield Bound'' and ''Way Out West''.\n\nThe fourth studio album, ''[[True Love (The Desert Rose Band album)|True Love]]'', was released in 1991.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> It was followed by 1993's ''[[Life Goes On (The Desert Rose Band album)|Life Goes On]]'',<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> released only in Europe. Several prominent country and bluegrass musicians made guest appearances on ''Life Goes On'' including [[Sam Bush]] on fiddle, [[Tony Rice]] and Larry Park (of [[Boy Howdy (band)|Boy Howdy]]) on guitar, and Al Perkins on dobro. Before the release of this final studio album, was the 1993 compilation ''Traditional''.\n\nJohn Jorgenson and Steve Duncan left the band in 1991.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Jorgenson went on to form the Hellecasters with Will Ray and Jerry Donahue; Duncan also joined the Hellecasters. John Jorgenson is currently playing gypsy jazz with his John Jorgenson Quintette. Chris and Herb recorded an acoustic album called ''The Other Side'' in 2005. They continue to tour as an acoustic duo. Former [[Buck Owens]] steel player Tom Brumley played with Joey Riley's band in [[Branson, Missouri]].
