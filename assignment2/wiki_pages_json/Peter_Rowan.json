Bluegrass legend Bill Monroe thought that Rowan sounded like himself. “When the two harmonized together, they were said to reach ‘heavenly heights.’\"<ref name=\"Peter Rowan Discography\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.peter-rowan.com/biography.html|title=Peter Rowan Discography|website=www.peter-rowan.com|access-date=2018-06-08}}</ref> Rowan co-wrote ‘Walls Of Time’ with Monroe, which has since become a bluegrass standard. Peter Rowan's Bluegrass Band consists of Blaine Sprouse on fiddle, Christopher Henry on mandolin, Paul Knight on bass, Patrick Sauber on banjo, Jamie Oldaker on drums. The band plays Rowan's original tunes along with Bill Monroe and Carter Family classics. \n\n'''Peter Rowan's Big Twang Theory'''\n\nRowan leads Big Twang Theory with musicians Mike Witcher on dobro, Paul Knight on bass, [[Nina Gerber]] on electric guitar, and Rowan's son Michael Carter Rowan on guitar and vocals. Drummers Larry Attamanuik and Ken Owen and banjo player Jeff Mosier also appear with Rowan's Big Twang Theory when their schedules permit. \"I have always wanted a band that was rooted in bluegrass, but could add the twang of Hank Williams, Carl Perkins and Buddy Holly. They all absorbed Bill Monroe's bluegrass into honky-tonk and rockabilly. I grew up dancing to that music.”<ref name=\"Peter Rowan Discography\"/> – Peter Rowan.\n\n'''Peter Rowan's Twang an' Groove'''\n\nTwang an’ Groove is a blend of rhythm and blues, reggae, and bluegrass music. The band features Rowan on electric guitar and vocals, Blaine Sprouse on fiddle, Mike Morgan on bass, and virtuoso drummer, Jamie Oldaker.\n<ref name=\"Peter Rowan Discography\"/>\n\n'''Peter Rowan & Crucial Reggae'''\n\nThis outfit is Rowan's nod to reggae music. Rowan's diversity in musical ability ventures beyond his bluegrass roots with Crucial Reggae to bring some of Rowan's most soulful original music to light. He is accompanied by reggae greats Tony Chin and Fully Fullwood, on guitar and bass respectively. Crucial Reggae is sometimes accompanied by other musicians to form an either five or six-piece band. They become a nine-piece band when they are joined by the Burning Spear horn section.\n\n'''The Free Mexican Airforce'''\n\nThe Free Mexican Airforce features Rowan and some of his most beloved songs: \"Come Back to Old Santa Fe\", \"Ride the Wild Mustang\", \"Midnight Moonlight\", and \"Free Mexican Airforce\". This four-piece often features Cindy Cashdollar on pedal steel guitar along with players on bass and drums.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.peter-rowan.com/biography.html|title=Peter Rowan Discography|website=www.peter-rowan.com|access-date=2018-06-11}}</ref>\n\n== Discography ==\n{{Further|Peter Rowan discography}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Fiorito, Mike (2023), ''Mescalito Riding His White Horse, Inspired by the Musical Adventures of Peter Rowan'' (O-Books)\n* Goldsmith, Thomas (2004), ''The Bluegrass Reader'', University of Illinois Press\n* Jackson, Blair (), ''Garcia: An American Life'', Penguin\n* Rosenberg, Neil V. – Wolfe, Charles (1991), Booklet: ''Bill Monroe, Bluegrass 1959–1969'', Bear Family BCD 15529\n* Von Schmidt, Eric – Rooney, Jim (1994), ''Baby, Let Me Follow You Down'', [[University of Massachusetts Press]]\n\n==External links==\n{{cc}}\n* [http://www.peter-rowan.com Official website]\n*{{allmusic}}\n\n{{Old & In the Way}}\n{{New Riders of the Purple Sage}}\n{{International Bluegrass Music Hall of Fame}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rowan, Peter}}\n[[Category:1942 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:American Buddhists]]\n[[Category:American folk guitarists]]\n[[Category:American folk singers]]\n[[Category:American male singers]]\n[[Category:American bluegrass guitarists]]\n[[Category:American male guitarists]]\n[[Category:American bluegrass musicians]]\n[[Category:Musicians from Boston]]\n[[Category:Guitarists from Massachusetts]]\n[[Category:20th-century American guitarists]]\n[[Category:20th-century American male musicians]]\n[[Category:Old & In the Way members]]\n[[Category:Earth Opera members]]\n[[Category:Muleskinner (band) members]]\n[[Category:Seatrain (band) members]]\n[[Category:Blue Grass Boys members]]"
