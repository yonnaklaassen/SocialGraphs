Both Gibson and Miller served as vocalists and guitarists in the Gibson/Miller Band, which also included Mike Daly ([[steel guitar]]), Bryan Grassmeyer (bass guitar), and Steve Grossman (drums). Grassmeyer was replaced in 1993 by Doug Kahan. Between 1992 and 1994, the Gibson/Miller Band recorded two albums for [[Epic Records]], in addition to charting seven singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Singles & Tracks]] charts. After disbanding in 1994, both Gibson and Miller assumed solo careers.\n\n==Biography==\nGibson/Miller Band was formed in 1990, when [[Doug Johnson (record producer)|Doug Johnson]], then-vice president of [[Epic Records]], introduced [[Dave Gibson (American songwriter)|Dave Gibson]] and Blue Miller to each other, thinking that the two artists would work well together as songwriters.<ref name=\"allmusic\">[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p26446/biography|pure_url=yes}} allmusic ((( Gibson/Miller Band > Biography )))]</ref> Among Gibson's cuts were \"[[If It Don't Come Easy]]\" by [[Tanya Tucker]], \"[[Ships That Don't Come In]]\" by [[Joe Diffie]] and \"[[Queen of Memphis]]\" by [[Confederate Railroad]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Stambler|first1=Irwin|last2=Laudon|first2=Grelun|title=Country Music: The Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d18K8QWcEo8C&dq=%22ships+that+don%27t+come+in%22&pg=PA179|year=2000|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=0-312-26487-9|page=179}}</ref> Gibson and Miller soon assembled a band and recorded a demo tape, which they sent to Johnson.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> By 1992, the band was signed to Epic Records; their debut single, \"Big Heart\", was released at the end of the year.\n\nIn 1993, the group's first album, titled ''Where There's Smoke'', was released. Counting \"Big Heart\", the album produced five chart singles overall, including the No.&nbsp;20 \"High Rollin'\", their highest-charting.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> The Gibson/Miller Band also received the [[Academy of Country Music]]'s award for Top New Vocal Duo or Group, beating [[Blackhawk (band)|Blackhawk]] and [[Boy Howdy]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://countrymusic.about.com/library/blprevacmnduogrp.htm |title=ACMs - Previous Winners - Top New Vocal Duo or Group |access-date=2007-07-05 |archive-date=2006-02-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060216035421/http://countrymusic.about.com/library/blprevacmnduogrp.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=\"bmi\">[http://www.bmi.com/news/entry/233776 Blue Miller Time at Warner-Chappell]</ref>\n\nA second album, ''Red, White & Blue Collar'', was released in 1994.

Both Gibson and Miller continued to record solo, and as backing musicians for other artists. In 1997, Gibson married singer-songwriter [[Daisy Dern]].
