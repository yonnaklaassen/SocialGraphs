His father was born in [[Iowa]], and worked as a [[Linotype machine|Linotype]] operator for the ''Berkeley Gazette'' in California. Lucile Fogerty taught second grade and was from [[Great Falls, Montana]]. John first attended a Catholic school, the School of the Madeleine, in Berkeley, California.

Later, Fogerty's brother Tom joined the group. In 1964, the band signed with [[Fantasy Records]], which, without the band's knowledge or approval, changed the band's name from the Blue Velvets to [[The Golliwogs]].

In 1968, they changed their name to Creedence Clearwater Revival, with John Fogerty taking his brother's place as lead singer. The band released their [[Creedence Clearwater Revival (album)|eponymous debut album]] and also had their first hit single, \"[[Susie Q (song)|Susie Q]]\". Many other hit singles and albums followed, beginning with \"[[Proud Mary]]\" and the album ''[[Bayou Country (album)|Bayou Country]]''.\n\nFogerty, as writer of the songs for the band as well as lead singer and lead guitarist, felt that his musical opinions should count for more than those of the others, leading to resentments within the band.<ref>{{cite journal|date=January 1998|title=Blue Moon Rising: The John Fogerty Interview (Cover Story)|journal=Audio Magazine}}</ref> These internal rifts, and Tom's feeling that he was being taken for granted, caused Tom to leave the group in January 1971. The two other group members, bassist Cook and drummer Clifford, wanted a greater role in the band's future. Fogerty, in an attempt to keep things together, insisted Cook and Clifford share equal songwriting and vocal time on what became the band's final album, ''[[Mardi Gras (album)|Mardi Gras]]'', released in April 1972, which included the band's last two singles, the 1971 hit \"[[Sweet Hitch-Hiker]]\", and \"[[Someday Never Comes]]\", which made it into the ''Billboard'' Top 20.\n\nCook and Clifford told Fogerty that the fans would not accept ''Mardi Gras'' as a CCR LP, but Fogerty told them, \"My voice is a unique instrument, and I will not lend it to your songs.\"{{citation needed|date=February 2022}} According to the two bandmates, Fogerty gave them an ultimatum: either they would do it or \nFogerty would quit immediately.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://eu.azcentral.com/story/entertainment/music/2015/07/07/doug-clifford-ccr-john-fogerty/29792885/ |title= Interview: Doug Clifford on CCR and John Fogerty |website= azcentral |access-date= April 15, 2020}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=February 2022}} They accepted Fogerty's ultimatum. The album received poor reviews, but was a commercial success, peaking at number 12 and achieving gold-record status, though it generated weaker sales than previous albums. The group disbanded shortly after the album was released.\n\nThe only reunion of all four original members was at Tom Fogerty's wedding in 1980. Fogerty, Clifford, and Cook played a 45-minute set at their 20th El Cerrito high school class reunion in 1983, and Fogerty and Clifford were reunited again for a brief set at their 25th class reunion.\n\nEven early in his career, “Fogerty's attitude toward music [was] serious, practiced, even perfectionistic. He drilled his bandmates in rehearsal after rehearsal, insisting that his songs be performed his way. ...[He] was known for not indulging in drugs, and although John struggled with alcohol later in life he had only contempt for musicians whose habits interfered with their performances.” <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sandefur |first1=Timothy |title=John Fogerty's Disciplined Focus |journal=The Objective Standard |volume=14 |issue= 4 |pages=84–85 |publisher=Glen Allen Press |date=Winter 2019 |url=https://theobjectivestandard.com/2019/08/john-fogertys-disciplined-focus/}}</ref> “Not in my band,” he writes in his memoir, ''Fortunate Son''. “You dare not be stoned playing music around me....

Despite the solo nature of the recordings, however, Fogerty elected to credit the album to The Blue Ridge Rangers—a band of which he was the only member.<ref name=\"Larkin\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=476}}</ref>\n\nThe eponymous ''[[The Blue Ridge Rangers]]'' was released in 1973; it spun off the [[top 20|top-20]] hit \"[[Jambalaya (On the Bayou)|Jambalaya]]\", as well as a lesser hit in \"Hearts of Stone\".<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Fogerty, still using \"The Blue Ridge Rangers\" name, then released a self-penned rock-and-roll single: \"You Don't Owe Me\" b/w \"Back in the Hills\" (Fantasy F-710). It was a commercial flop, failing to make the US [[Billboard Hot 100]], though \"You Don't Owe Me\" was a minor hit in Canada, reaching No. 79. Fogerty thereafter abandoned the \"Blue Ridge Rangers\" identity, and released all his subsequent work under his own name.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> In early 1974, Fogerty released \"Comin' Down The Road\"&mdash;backed with the instrumental \"Ricochet\".\n\nHis first official solo album, ''[[John Fogerty (album)|John Fogerty]]'', was released in 1975.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Sales were slim and legal problems delayed a follow-up, though it yielded \"[[Rockin' All Over the World (song)|Rockin' All Over the World]]\", a No. 27 hit for Fogerty in the United States. In 1977, the British rock band [[Status Quo (band)|Status Quo]] recorded their version of \"Rockin' All Over the World\", which became a huge hit and made the song world-famous.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Status Quo played it at the opening of the 1985 [[Live Aid]] concert.\n\nIn 1976, Fogerty finished an album called ''[[Hoodoo (John Fogerty album)|Hoodoo]]''.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> A single, \"You Got the Magic\" backed with \"Evil Thing\", preceded the album's release, but it performed poorly. The album, for which covers had already been printed, was rejected by [[Asylum Records]] a few weeks before its scheduled release, and Fogerty agreed that it was not up to his usual high standards. Fogerty told Asylum Records to destroy the master tapes for ''Hoodoo'' sometime in the 1980s.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://dangerousminds.net/comments/hoodoo_john_fogertys_lost_occult_tinged_disco_rock_album |title= 'Hoodoo', John Fogerty's Lost, Occult-Tinged Disco Album |website= Dangerous Minds |date= May 20, 2016 |access-date= April 15, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===1985–1997===\n{{See also|The Old Man Down the Road|Fogerty v. Fantasy}}\nAfter a hiatus of several years from the music industry, Fogerty's solo career re-emerged with 1985's ''[[Centerfield (album)|Centerfield]]'', his first album for [[Warner Bros. Records]], which had taken co-ownership of Asylum's contract with Fogerty.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> ''Centerfield'' went to the top of the charts and included a top-10 hit in \"[[The Old Man Down the Road]]\".<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> The title track is frequently played on classic rock radio and at baseball games to this day, but the album led to legal problems for Fogerty.\n\nTwo songs on the album, \"Zanz Kant Danz\" and \"Mr. Greed\", were believed to be attacks on Fogerty's former boss at [[Fantasy Records]], [[Saul Zaentz]].<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> \"Zanz Kant Danz\" was about a pig that cannot dance, but would \"steal your money\". When Zaentz responded with a lawsuit, Fogerty issued a revised version: \"Vanz Kant Danz\" (changing the lead character's name to Vanz). Another lawsuit (''Fantasy, Inc. v. Fogerty'') claimed that \"The Old Man Down the Road\" shared the same chorus as \"[[Run Through the Jungle]]\", a song from Fogerty's days with CCR to which Fantasy Records still owned the publishing rights.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Fogerty ultimately won his case when he proved that the two songs were distinct compositions and also that sounding like himself was not plagiarizing. Fogerty then [[counterclaim|countersued]] for attorney fees (''[[Fogerty v. Fantasy]]''). After losing in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, Fogerty won his case in the [[U.S. Supreme Court]], which ruled that a trial court has discretion in awarding fees to defendants or plaintiffs.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>\n\nOn May 31, 1985, Fogerty filmed a one-hour music and interview special for Showtime called ''John Fogerty's All-Stars''. The setlist consisted of [[rhythm and blues]] tunes from the 1960s, as well as material from the ''Centerfield'' LP and the song \"No Love in You\" written by Michael Anderson, which Fogerty found on the [[Textones]]' debut album ''Midnight Mission'' and he later recorded with Textones' band leader Carla Olson. ''John Fogerty's All-Stars'' was recorded in front of an audience of Warners Bros. Music employees and other invited guests at A&M Records on La Brea in Hollywood. The band included [[Albert Lee]], [[Booker T. Jones]], [[Duck Dunn]], [[Steve Douglas (saxophonist)|Steve Douglas]], and [[Prairie Prince]].\n\nThe follow-up album to ''Centerfield'' was ''[[Eye of the Zombie]]'' in 1986, but it was significantly less successful than its predecessor.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Fogerty toured behind the album, but he refused to play any CCR material. ''Eye of the Zombie'' took on a darker mood, talking about a troubled society, terrorism, and pop stars selling out. For over 20 years after the ''Eye of the Zombie'' tour ended in late 1986, Fogerty refused to play material from the album in concert. However, \"Change in the Weather\" was included in the setlist for his 2009 tour, and it was even re-recorded for that year's solo release, ''[[The Blue Ridge Rangers Rides Again]]''.\n\nFogerty played CCR material again at a concert in Washington, D.C., for Vietnam veterans that took place on July 4, 1987. The show was aired on [[HBO]]. Aside from a guest appearance at the Palomino and performance at the 1986 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony, this was the first time Fogerty had performed any Creedence Clearwater Revival songs for a large audience since 1972. On May 27, 1989, he played a set of CCR material at [[Oakland Coliseum]] for the Concert Against AIDS. His backing band that night consisted of [[Jerry Garcia]] and [[Bob Weir]] on guitars, [[Randy Jackson]] on bass, and [[Steve Jordan (musician)|Steve Jordan]] on drums.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://maniacpaul.thejakubowskis.com/details.php?b_id=112v|title=John Fogerty – In Concert Against AIDS |year=2004 |publisher=thejakubowskis.com|access-date=June 1, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 1990, his brother Tom Fogerty died of complications from AIDS at the age of 48, survived by his second wife and six children. Tom contracted HIV from blood transfusions during surgery for a back ailment. Specifically, he died from a tuberculosis infection. John Fogerty has mentioned that the darkest moments in his life were when his brother took the record company's side in their royalties dispute, and the fact that when his brother died, the two of them were barely speaking to each other.<ref>VH1 Legends: John Fogerty—''Viacom International, VH1, 1996''</ref> In fact, even in the brothers' very last conversation with each other, Tom at one point referred to Creedence Clearwater Revival's former manager Saul Zaentz as his \"best friend\".<ref name= \"Autobiography\"/> Given that Zaentz had swindled the band out of millions of dollars and had just recently attempted to sue John, this revelation made it painfully difficult for John to reconcile with Tom. In the eulogy he delivered at Tom's funeral, he said: \"We wanted to grow up and be musicians. I guess we achieved half of that, becoming rock 'n roll stars. We didn't necessarily grow up.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/may/29/john-fogerty-creedence-clearwater-interview|title=John Fogerty: 'I had rules.

According to him, while there, he had the realization that Robert Johnson was the true spiritual owner of his own songs, no matter what businessman owned the rights to them, thus Fogerty decided to start making a new album and to perform his old CCR material regularly in concert.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1518067/john-fogerty-embraces-his-past.jhtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510095507/http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1518067/john-fogerty-embraces-his-past.jhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 10, 2008|title=John Fogerty Embraces His Past|last=Gilbert|first=Calvin|date=December 13, 2005|work=[[Country Music Television|CMT]] News|access-date=2008-06-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.democratandchronicle.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080731/ENT0501/807310303/1052/ENT|title=John Fogerty's epiphany at a bluesman's plot|last=Spevak|first=Jeff|date=July 31, 2008|work=[[Democrat and Chronicle]]|access-date=2008-08-02|archive-date=December 20, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220064118/http://www.democratandchronicle.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080731/ENT0501/807310303/1052/ENT|url-status=dead}}</ref> At this time, visiting the Mt.

Fogerty refused to perform with his former bandmates and fellow inductees Stu Cook and Doug Clifford during the musical portion of the induction ceremony, citing the Zaentz lawsuit as a reason. In place of the surviving members of CCR, Fogerty recruited session musicians on drums and bass and was also joined by [[Bruce Springsteen]] and [[Robbie Robertson]] in performing three songs: \"[[Who'll Stop the Rain (song)|Who'll Stop the Rain]]\", \"[[Born on the Bayou]]\", and \"[[Green River (song)|Green River]]\".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Sweeting|first1=Adam|title=The saddest story in rock|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2000/jul/11/artsfeatures3|access-date=March 30, 2015|work=theguardian.com|date=July 11, 2000}}</ref> The other two surviving members were believed to have laughed it off in disappointment.
