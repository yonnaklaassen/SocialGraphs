Between 1985 and 1995, the group recorded three major label albums as The Highwaymen: two on [[Columbia Records]] and one for [[Liberty Records]]. Their Columbia works produced three chart singles, including the number one \"[[Highwayman (song)|Highwayman]]\" in 1985.\n\nBetween 1996 and 1998, Nelson, Kristofferson, Cash, and Jennings provided the voice and dramatization for the ''Louis L'Amour Collection'', a four-CD box set of seven [[Louis L'Amour]] stories published by the HighBridge Company, although the four were not credited as \"The Highwaymen\" in this work.\n\nBesides the four formal members of the group, one other vocal artist appeared on a Highwaymen recording: [[Johnny Rodriguez]], who provided Spanish vocal on \"[[Deportee (Plane Wreck at Los Gatos)|Deportee]]\", a [[Woody Guthrie]] composition, from the album ''Highwayman''.\n\nThe four starred in one movie together: the 1986 film [[Stagecoach (1986 film)|''Stagecoach'']].\n\nIn 1990, the original members of [[The Highwaymen (folk band)| the 1950s-'60s folk group of the same name]] sued The Highwaymen over their use of the name, which was inspired by a [[Jimmy Webb]] ballad the country stars had recorded. The suit was dropped when all parties agreed that the folk group owned the name but that the earlier group would grant a nonexclusive, nontransferable license to the supergroup to use the name. The two groups then shared the stage at a 1990 concert in Hollywood.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Number #1 : the story of the original Highwaymen|last=Noble|first=Richard E.|publisher=Outskirts Press|year=2009|isbn=9781432738099|location=Denver|pages=146–148|oclc=426388468}}</ref>\n\n==Albums==\n===''Highwayman''===\nFormed in 1985, the group did not have an official name when they released their first two albums on [[Columbia Records]]. The first album, ''[[Highwayman (The Highwaymen album)|Highwayman]]'', was credited to \"Nelson, Jennings, Cash, Kristofferson\". The single \"[[Highwayman (song)|Highwayman]]\", a [[Jimmy Webb]] composition, became a #1 country hit. Their cover of [[Guy Clark]]'s \"Desperados Waiting for a Train\" reached the Top 20. The album was produced by [[Chips Moman]].\n\n===''Highwayman 2''===\nIn 1990, the four members reunited for a second effort, titled ''[[Highwayman 2]]'', which reached #4 on the country album chart. The [[Lee Clayton (musician)|Lee Clayton]]-penned song \"[[Silver Stallion (song)|Silver Stallion]]\" was the first single and made the country Top 40. The album was nominated for a [[Grammy]] for Best Country Vocal Collaboration. ''Highwayman 2'' was produced, once again, by Moman. Six of the songs were written or co-written by members of the group.\n\n===''The Road Goes on Forever''===\nThe group's final release (now listed as \"Highway''men''\") prior to Jennings's death in 2002 was 1995's [[Don Was]]-produced album ''[[The Road Goes On Forever (The Highwaymen album)|The Road Goes on Forever]]'', (a [[Robert Earl Keen]] cover), with the single, \"It Is What It Is\". A tenth-anniversary edition of ''The Road Goes on Forever'' appeared in 2005, with several [[bonus track]]s added as well as, in some versions, a [[DVD]] containing the video for \"It Is What It Is\" and a documentary titled ''Live Forever – In the Studio with the Highwaymen''.\n\n=== Final years: Jennings and Cash’s health issues and deaths, breakup, aftermath, and occasional partial reunions ===\n\nThe band continued to tour into the late 1990s, before Jennings and Cash both started to decline in health, which prevented them from maintaining a full touring schedule. All four continued to perform as solo artists, with Jennings briefly joining another country supergroup, [[Old Dogs (group)|Old Dogs]]; Jennings died in 2002, and Cash died in 2003.  \n\nNelson and Kristofferson collaborated on multiple occasions following the deaths of Jennings and Cash, but they were not credited as The Highwaymen for these occasions.  For example, in November 2003, Nelson and Kristofferson reunited to perform \"[[Big River (Johnny Cash song)|Big River]]\", one of Cash's songs that he had re-recorded in 1985 with his Highwaymen bandmates, with [[George Jones]] at a Grand Ole Opry-sponsored memorial concert for Cash at the [[Ryman Auditorium]] in Nashville, Tennessee.<ref name=\"Cash Tribute 2003 Ryman\">{{cite news |last1=CBS News |last2=The Associated Press |title=Cash Tribute |work=CBS News |publisher=CBS News/The Associated Press |date=November 11, 2003}}</ref>\n\n\"Those tours and the records we made were a great time,\" recalled Kristofferson in 2010. \"I just wish I was more aware of how lucky I was to share a stage with those people. I had no idea that two of them would be done so soon. Hell, I was up there and I had all my heroes with me. These are guys whose ashtrays I used to clean. I'm kinda amazed I wasn't more amazed.\"<ref>Bell, Max: \"Q&A: Kris Kristofferson\"; ''[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]'' #148, August 2010, p34</ref>\n\nIn 2012, Kristofferson, [[Jamey Johnson]], and [[Snoop Dogg]] collaborated with Nelson on the single \"[[Roll Me Up and Smoke Me When I Die]]\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/heroes-the-new-willie-nelson-album-coming-tuesday-may-15-142799845.html|title=Heroes, The New Willie Nelson Album, Coming Tuesday, May 15|work=PRnewswite|publisher=PR Newswire Association LLC|date=May 15, 2012|access-date=March 17, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, Nelson and Kristofferson recorded a virtual collaboration of “One Too Many Mornings”, featuring archived vocals by Cash and Jennings recorded during the 1980s.
