He signed to [[Warner Bros. Records]] in 1989, releasing seven studio albums and a greatest hits package for the label between then and 1999. In the 2000s, he released three studio albums on [[Columbia Records]] and one for the now-defunct [[Category 5 Records]]. Seven of his albums (counting the Greatest Hits) are [[music recording sales certification|certified platinum]] or higher by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA); the highest-certified is 1991's ''[[It's All About to Change]]'', which is certified triple-platinum.

Tritt stated that beginning in 1993, he was awakened \"regularly\" by disembodied voices in a vacation cabin that he owned – the voices spoke in an unknown dialect. His wife, Theresa, eventually heard them as well. According to Tritt, \"Over the years, these voices started happening\non such a frequent basis that we were afraid to come up here.\" He also asserted that footprints once appeared in the carpet of the cabin, and imprints in the bedspread, that belonged to neither him nor his wife.\n\nThe show's host, Kim Russo, concluded that an African-American medicine man had been stabbed and beaten to death on the property, and the voices that Tritt was hearing belonged to the murderers' angry spirits. A title card in the program notes that \"On August 14, 1875, a group of men killed a '[[Hoodoo (folk magic)|hoodoo]] doctor' close to the land where Travis' cabin was built.\" Russo believed that the hoodoo doctor's spirit also lingered on the property because it found a \"kindred spirit\" in Tritt.<ref>[http://www.mylifetime.com/shows/the-haunting-of/season-4/episode-9] {{dead link|date=September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x3di96b|title=The Haunting Of S05E22 – Travis Tritt – video|website=Dailymotion.com|access-date=September 29, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n{{Main|Travis Tritt discography}}\n'''Studio albums'''\n*''Proud of the Country'' (1987)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Travistritt/status/866469859089162242|title=It was released.
