They have released three albums and two EPs, and their fifth album ''Waterloo, Tennessee'' was produced by [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] of [[Led Zeppelin]].\n\n==History==\n\n===1999-2002: Founding===\nGroves and Serrapere, both American songwriters and multi-instrumentalists, started the band in 2000.<ref name=\"faq\"/> The Uncle Earl biography, however, states 1999 as founding year. According to the founders, they had no original interest in starting a band. Instead, they wanted to promote a CD with traditional material they had recorded, and put together a small temporary lineup to play a few shows. After the initial performances went well, the group decided to stay together.<ref name=\"biouncleearl\"/> Until the end of 2003 the line-up of the band had changed several times. Amongst the members in this period where Tahmineh Gueramy (fiddle, vocals), Amanda Kowalski (bass, vocals), Casey Henry (banjo, vocals) and Sally Truitt (bass, vocals).<ref name=\"webarchive\"/>\n\nGroves mentioned in an interview how the band got its name, \"We just thought it would be a funny name for an all-women's group,\" she says. \"But we are fans of [[Earl Scruggs]], [[Steve Earle]], and [[Uncle Tupelo]]. It did come up in our discussion that there's some important Earls in this business. And Uncles.\"<ref name=\"realcountry\"/> They refer to themselves as \"the g'Earls,\" while their fans have been nicknamed \"g'Earlfriends.\"<ref name=\"newsletter\"/>\n\n===2002-2010: Albums===\n{{ external media\n| float  =right \n| video1 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6ed6p74dM4 Music Video for \"Streak o' Lean, Streak o' Fat\" by Uncle Earl] (Nov 20, 2009)\n| video2 = \n}}\nIn 2002 the band released their album ''She Went Upstairs''.\n\nFounding member Serrapere left in 2003, and as of 2008 played with the Willie Dunns.<ref name=\"Willie Dunns\"/> By the end of 2003 a long-lasting lineup was in place, with all the band members serving as co-vocalists.  The 2003 lineup consisted of KC Groves on [[mandolin]] and [[guitar]], [[Abigail Washburn]] on [[banjo]], [[Rayna Gellert]] on [[fiddle]] and [[Kristin Andreassen]], [[guitarist]], [[fiddler]], and [[clogging]].  There was no permanent [[bassist|bass player]].<ref name=\"blogsa\"/>\n\nIn 2004, the group released their first EP, titled ''Going to the Western Slope.'' Several months later, they released their sophomore EP ''Raise a Ruckus.'' In 2005 the band was signed to [[Rounder Records]], who released their first full-length album, ''She Waits for Night'', later that year. Their second full-length album, ''Waterloo, TN'', was released on Rounder Records in 2007.\n\nIn late 2009, the band failed to go on tour, quoting trouble coordinating band members' schedules.<ref name=\"blogsa\"/>\n\n===2010-present===\nIn 2010, the band announced that Gellert and Washburn had left on amicable terms, and were pursuing other musical projects.<ref name=\"blogsa\"/> The new Uncle Earl line up is Andreassen, Groves, Stephanie Coleman on [[fiddle]], Paula Bradley on [[banjo]], [[banjo ukulele]] and [[clogging]], and Rachel Eddy on [[banjo]], [[fiddle]], and [[Bass (guitar)|bass]].<ref name=\"Introductions and Updates\"/> The lineup toured in support of their previous album in 2010, and continue to periodically perform.\n\n==Members==\n\n===Current as of 2014===\n[[File:Uncle Earl 01.jpg|thumb|right|280px|European tour 2010 at ''Kult'', [[Niederstetten]]; from left to right: Rachel Eddy, [[KC Groves]], [[Kristin Andreassen]], Stephanie Coleman and Paula Bradley]]\n*[[KC Groves]] <small>(1999–present)</small> - vocals, [[mandolin]] and [[guitar]]\n*[[Kristin Andreassen]] <small>(2003–present)</small> - vocals, [[guitarist]], [[fiddler]], and [[clogging]]\n*Stephanie Coleman <small>(2010–present)</small> - [[fiddle]]\n*Paula Bradley <small>(2010–present)</small> - [[banjo]], [[banjo ukulele]] and [[clogging]]\n*Rachel Eddy <small>(2010–present)</small> -  [[banjo]], [[fiddle]], and [[Bass (guitar)|bass]]\n\n===Past members===\n*Jo Serrapere <small>(1999-2003)</small> - vocals, etc.\n*Amanda Kowalski <small>(~2000-2003)</small> - bass, vocals\n*Casey Henry <small>(~2000-2003)</small> - banjo, vocals\n*Sally Truitt <small>(~2000-2003)</small> - bass, vocals\n*Tahmineh Gueramy <small>(~2000-2003)</small> - fiddle, vocals\n*[[Rayna Gellert]] <small>(2003-2010)</small> - vocals, fiddle\n*[[Abigail Washburn]] <small>(2003-2010)</small> - banjo, vocals\n*[[Sharon Gilchrist]] <small>(2004-2005, 2010)</small> - bass\n*[[Bryn Davies (musician)|Bryn Davies]] - bass\n\n===Bass players===\nThe band has had a mostly rotating line-up of bass players.
