He began playing music in 1946, originally with his older brother [[Carter Stanley]] as part of [[The Stanley Brothers]], and most often as the leader of his band, '''The Clinch Mountain Boys'''. Ralph was also known as '''Dr. Ralph Stanley'''.\n\nHe was part of the first generation of [[bluegrass music]]ians and was inducted into both the [[International Bluegrass Music Hall of Honor]] and the [[Grand Ole Opry]].\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Ralph Stanley - Ralph Stanley II - Ron Baker 2008.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Stanley and son Ralph II in 2008]]\nStanley was born, grew up, and lived in rural [[Southwest Virginia]]—\"in a little town called [[McClure, Virginia|McClure]] at a place called Big Spraddle Creek, just up the holler\" from where he moved in 1936. Before that he lived in another part of [[Dickenson County]].<ref name=\"virginia-living55\">\"Old-Time Man\" interview by Don Harrison June 2008 ''[[Virginia Living]]'', p. 55.</ref> The son of Lee and Lucy Smith Stanley, Ralph did not grow up around a lot of music in his home.  As he said, his \"daddy didn't play an instrument, but sometimes he would sing church music... I'd hear him sing songs like '[[Man of Constant Sorrow]],' '[[Pretty Polly (ballad)|Pretty Polly]]' and '[[Omie Wise]].'\"<ref name=\"virginia-living55\"/>\n\n{{blockquote|I got my first banjo when I was a teenager.  I guess I was 15, 16 years old.  My aunt had this old banjo, and Mother bought it for me ... paid $5 for it, which back then was probably like $5,000.  [My parents] had a little store, and I remember my aunt took it out in groceries.<ref name=\"virginia-living55\"/>}}\n\nHe learned to play the [[banjo]], [[clawhammer]] style, from his mother:\n\n{{blockquote|She had 11 brothers and sisters, and all of them could play the five-string banjo.  She played gatherings around the neighborhood, like bean stringin's. She tuned it up for me and played this tune, \"Shout Little Luly,\" and I tried to play it like she did.  But I think I developed my own style of the banjo.<ref name=\"virginia-living55\"/>}}\n\nHe graduated from high school on May 2, 1945, and was inducted into the [[United States Army|Army]] on May 16, serving for \"little more than a year.\" When he got home he immediately began performing:\n\n{{blockquote|... my daddy and Carter picked me up from the (station), and Carter was playing with another group, Roy Sykes and the Blue Ridge Mountain Boys, and they had a personal appearance that night.  So I sung a song with Carter on the radio before I even got home.<ref name=\"virginia-living56\">\"Old-Time Man\" interview by Don Harrison June 2008 ''[[Virginia Living]]'', p. 56.</ref>}}\n\n===Clinch Mountain Boys===\n[[File:Dr. Ralph Stanley Grass Valley CA February 2006.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Stanley in 2006]]\nAfter considering a course in \"veterinary\", he decided instead to join his older guitar-playing brother [[Carter Stanley]] (1925–1966) to form the Clinch Mountain Boys in 1946. Drawing heavily on the musical traditions of the area, which included the unique singing style of the [[Primitive Baptist Universalist]] church and the sweet down-home family harmonies of the [[Carter Family]], the two Stanley brothers began playing on local radio stations. They first performed at [[Norton, Virginia]]'s WNVA, but did not stay long there, moving on instead to [[Bristol, Virginia]], and [[WZAP|WCYB]] to start the show ''Farm and Fun Time'', where they stayed \"off and on for 12 years\".<ref name=\"virginia-living56\"/>\n\nAt first they covered \"a lot of [[Bill Monroe]] music\" (one of the first groups to pick up the new \"bluegrass\" format).<ref name=trischka>Trischka, Tony, \"Ralph Stanley\", ''Banjo Song Book'', Oak Publications, 1977</ref> They soon \"found out that didn't pay off—we needed something of our own. So we started writing songs in 1947, 1948. I guess I wrote 20 or so banjo tunes, but Carter was a better writer than me.\"<ref name=\"virginia-living56\"/> When [[Columbia Records]] signed them as The Stanley Brothers, Monroe left in protest joining [[Decca Records]]. Later, Carter went back to sing for the \"Father of Bluegrass\", Monroe.\n\nRalph Stanley gave his opinion on Bill Monroe's apparent change of heart: \"He [Monroe] knew Carter would make him a good singer... Bill Monroe loved our music and loved our singing.\"<ref name=\"virginia-living56\"/>\n\nThe Stanley Brothers joined [[King Records (USA)|King Records]] in the late '50s, a record company which was so eclectic that it included [[James Brown]] at the time. In fact, James Brown and his band were in the studio when the Stanley Brothers recorded \"[[Finger Poppin' Time]]\". \"James and his band were poppin' their fingers on that\" according to Ralph.<ref name=\"virginia-living56\"/>  At King Records, they \"went to a more 'Stanley style', the sound that people most know today.\"<ref name=\"virginia-living56\"/>\n\nRalph and Carter performed as The Stanley Brothers with their band, The Clinch Mountain Boys, from 1946 to 1966. Ralph kept the band name when he continued as a solo act after Carter's death, from 1967 until his death in 2016.\n\n===Solo===\nAfter Carter died of complications of cirrhosis in 1966, after ailing for \"a year or so\",<ref name=\"virginia-living56\"/> Ralph Stanley faced a hard decision on whether to continue performing on his own. \"I was worried, I didn't know if I could do it by myself. But boy, I got letters, 3,000 of 'em, and phone calls... I went to Syd Nathan at King and asked him if he wanted me to go on, and he said, 'Hell yes! You might be better than both of them.'\"<ref name=\"virginia-living567\">\"Old-Time Man\" interview by Don Harrison June 2008 ''[[Virginia Living]]'', p. 56-7.</ref>\n\nHe decided to go it alone, eventually reviving The Clinch Mountain Boys. [[Larry Sparks]], Roy Lee Centers, and Charlie Sizemore were among those with whom he played in the revived band. He encountered [[Ricky Skaggs]] and [[Keith Whitley]] arriving late to his own show, \"They were about 16 or 17, and they were holding the crowd 'til we got there... They sounded just exactly like (the Stanley Brothers).\"<ref name=\"virginia-living57\">\"Old-Time Man\" interview by Don Harrison June 2008 ''[[Virginia Living]]'', p. 57.</ref> Seeing their potential, he hired them \"to give 'em a chance\", though that meant a seven-member band.<ref name=\"virginia-living56\"/> Eventually, his son, Ralph Stanley II, took over as lead singer and rhythm guitarist for The Clinch Mountain Boys.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ralphstanleyii.com/history.html |title=Ralph Stanley II.|website=Ralphstanleyii.com |access-date=September 17, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302005927/http://www.ralphstanleyii.com/history.html |archive-date=March 2, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> His grandson Nathan Stanley became the last lead singer and band leader for The Clinch Mountain Boys.{{Citation needed|date=April 2021}}\n\n===Clinch Mountain Boys members===\n{{more citations needed section|date=June 2016}}\n\n====1967 to 2016====\n{{div col|colwidth=24em}}\n*Ralph Stanley ([[Lead vocalist]], [[banjo]])\n*Jack Cooke ([[upright bass|bass]])\n*[[Curly Ray Cline]] ([[fiddle]])\n*[[George Shuffler]] ([[Steel-string guitar|guitar]], [[upright bass|bass]])\n*[[Lonesome Pine Fiddlers|Melvin Goins]] ([[upright bass|bass]], [[Steel-string guitar|guitar]])\n*[[Larry Sparks]] ([[Lead vocalist]], [[Steel-string guitar|guitar]])\n*Roy Lee Centers ([[Lead vocalist]], [[Steel-string guitar|guitar]])\n*[[Ricky Skaggs]] ([[mandolin]], [[fiddle]])\n*[[Keith Whitley]] ([[Lead vocalist]], [[Steel-string guitar|guitar]])\n*Charlie Sizemore ([[Lead vocalist]], [[Steel-string guitar|guitar]])\n*Hook n Beans (Buddy Moore) lead singer- guitar\n*Ricky Lee ([[Steel-string guitar|guitar]])\n*Junior Blankenship ([[Steel-string guitar|guitar]])\n*Kenneth Davis ([[Steel-string guitar|guitar]])\n*Renfro Proffit ([[Steel-string guitar|guitar]])\n*[[Dry Branch Fire Squad|Ron Thomason]] ([[mandolin]])\n*Steve Sparkman ([[banjo]])\n*[[James Alan Shelton]] ([[Steel-string guitar|guitar]])\n*Sammy Adkins ([[Lead vocalist]], [[Steel-string guitar|guitar]])\n*Todd Meade ([[fiddle]])\n*Ralph 'Hank' Smith ([[Steel-string guitar|Lead guitar]])\n*Ernie Thacker ([[Lead vocalist]], [[Steel-string guitar|guitar]], [[mandolin]])\n*John Rigsby ([[mandolin]])\n*Dewey Brown ([[fiddle]]),([[Vocals]])\n*Jimmy Cameron ([[Bass guitar|Bass]]), ([[Vocals]])\n*Audey Ratliff ([[upright bass|bass]])\n*Ralph Stanley II ([[Lead vocalist]], [[Steel-string guitar|guitar]])\n*Nathan Stanley ([[mandolin]], [[Lead vocalist]], [[Steel-string guitar|guitar]])\n*James Price ([[fiddle]])\n*Randall Hibbitts ([[upright bass|bass]])\n*Mitchell Van Dyke ([[banjo]])\n*Jarrod Church ([[banjo]])\n*Alex Hibbitts ([[Mandolin]])\n*Jimmie Vaughan  ([[Rhythm Guitar]], [[Vocals]])\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Political career===\nAbout 1970, Ralph Stanley ran for Clerk of Court and Commissioner of Revenue in [[Dickenson County, Virginia|Dickenson County]] and said:\n\n{{blockquote|What happened is, somebody traded me off—[[dummy candidate|they used my popularity and money to elect somebody else]].

He wanted it in the [[Dock Boggs]] style.  So I got my banjo and learned it the way he did it.  You see, I had recorded \"O Death\" three times, done it with Carter. So I went down with my banjo to Nashville and I said, \"T-Bone, let me sing it the way I want to sing it,\" and I laid my banjo down and sung it [[a cappella]].  After two or three verses, he stopped me and said, \"That's it.\"<ref name=\"virginia-living57\"/>}}\n\nWith that song, Stanley won a [[Grammy Awards of 2002|2002 Grammy Award]] in the category of [[Grammy Award for Best Male Country Vocal Performance|Best Male Country Vocal Performance]]. \"That put the icing on the cake for me,\" he said. \"It put me in a different category.\"<ref name=\"virginia-living57\"/>\n\n===Later life===\nHe was known in the world of [[bluegrass music]] by the popular title, \"Dr. Ralph Stanley\", having been awarded an honorary doctorate in music from [[Lincoln Memorial University]]<ref name= \"CW Farewell\">{{cite web|last=Freeman|first=Jon|title=Dr. Ralph Stanley Announces Farewell Tour |url= http://www.countryweekly.com/news/dr-ralph-stanley-announces-farewell-tour|work=Country Weekly|date= June 26, 2013 |access-date= August 8, 2017| url-status= dead| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131008201630/http://www.countryweekly.com/news/dr-ralph-stanley-announces-farewell-tour| archive-date= October 8, 2013}}</ref> of [[Harrogate, Tennessee]] in 1976.

In \"Stanley style\", the rolls of the banjo are continuous, while being picked fairly close to the bridge on the banjo, giving the tone of the instrument a very crisp, articulate snap to the strings as the player plays them.\n\n==Selected discography==\n{{more citations needed section|date=June 2016}}\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:18em;\"| Title\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:18em;\"| Details\n! colspan=\"5\"| Peak chart positions\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n! style=\"width:40px;\"| [[Top Bluegrass Albums|US Grass]]\n! style=\"width:40px;\"| [[Top Country Albums|US Country]]\n! style=\"width:40px;\"| [[Billboard 200|US]]\n! style=\"width:40px;\"| [[Top Heatseekers|US Heat]]\n! style=\"width:40px;\"| [[Independent Albums|US Indie]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Cry From the Cross''\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \n* Release date: 1971\n* Label: [[Rebel Records]]\n| —\n| —\n| —\n| —\n| —\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Clinch Mountain Gospel''\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \n* Release date: 1977\n* Label: [[Rebel Records]]\n| —\n| —\n| —\n| —\n| —\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''I'll Answer the Call''\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \n* Release date: 1987\n* Label: [[Rebel Records]]\n| —\n| —\n| —\n| —\n| —\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Clinch Mountain Country''\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \n* Release date: May 19, 1998\n* Label: [[Rebel Records]]\n| —\n| —\n| —\n| —\n| —\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Man of Constant Sorrow''\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \n* Release date: January 21, 2001\n* Label: [[Rebel Records]]\n| —\n| —\n| —\n| —\n| —\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Clinch Mountain Sweethearts''\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \n* Release date: September 25, 2001\n* Label: [[Rebel Records]]\n| —\n| —\n| —\n| —\n| —\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[Ralph Stanley (album)|Ralph Stanley]]''\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \n* Release date: June 11, 2002\n* Label: [[Columbia Records]]/DMZ\n| 3\n| 22\n| 163\n| 5\n| —\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Poor Rambler''\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \n* Release date: June 17, 2003\n* Label: [[King Records (United States)|King Records]]\n| —\n| —\n| —\n| —\n| —\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[Shine On (Ralph Stanley album)|Shine On]]''\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \n* Release date: June 7, 2005\n* Label: Rebel Records\n| 6\n| —\n| —\n| —\n| —\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''A Distant Land to Roam''\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \n* Release date: May 30, 2006\n* Label: Columbia Records/DMZ\n| 4\n| —\n| —\n| —\n| —\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Mountain Preacher's Child''\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \n* Release date: April 3, 2007\n* Label: Rebel Records\n| 9\n| —\n| —\n| —\n| —\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''A Mother's Prayer''\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \n* Release date: April 19, 2011\n* Label: Rebel Records\n| 6\n| —\n| —\n| —\n| —\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Old Songs & Ballads''\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \n* Release date: August 14, 2012\n* Label: Rebel Records\n| 12\n| —\n| —\n| —\n| —\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Old Songs & Ballads: Volume Two''\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \n* Release date: August 14, 2012\n* Label: Rebel Records\n| 14\n| —\n| —\n| —\n| —\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Side by Side'' <small>(with Ralph Stanley II)</small>\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \n* Release date: February 18, 2014\n* Label: Rebel Records\n| 3\n| —\n| —\n| —\n| —\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''My Life & Legacy:<br />The Very Best of Ralph Stanley''\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \n* Release date: September 16, 2014\n* Label: Rebel Records\n| 9\n| —\n| —\n| —\n| —\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Ralph Stanley & Friends:<br />Man of Constant Sorrow''\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \n* Release date: January 19, 2015\n* Label: [[Cracker Barrel]]\n| 1\n| 14\n| —\n| 1\n| 17\n|-\n| colspan=\"7\" style=\"font-size:8pt\"| \"—\" denotes releases that did not chart\n|}\n<ref name=\"praguefrank\">{{cite web|url=http://countrydiscography.blogspot.com/2009/06/ralph-stanley.html|title=Ralph Stanley|work=Praguefrank's Country Music Discographies |access-date=January 19, 2010}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"hillwilliam\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hillwilliam/BGdiscography/ |title=Ralph Stanley |work=Discography of Bluegrass Sound Recordings, 1942– |publisher=[[ibiblio]]|access-date =January 19, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===With Joe Isaacs===\n*''Gospel Gathering'' (1995, Freeland)\n\n===Other contributions===\n*''Lifted: Songs of the Spirit'' (2002, [[Sony]]/[[Hear Music]]) – \"Listen to the Shepherd\"\n*''Re:Generation Music Project soundtrack'' (2012) – \"Wayfaring Stranger\"<ref>[https://www.usatoday.com/life/music/news/story/2012-02-15/regeneration-music-project-skrillex-doors-mark-ronson-pretty-lights-dj-premier/53113818/1 Musicians mix genres in 'Re:Generation' documentary], USA Today, February 16, 2012.
