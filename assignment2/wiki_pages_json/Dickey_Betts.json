He initially shared the band's signature dual [[lead guitar]] roles with band founder [[Duane Allman]], and assumed the solo lead after Allman's death in October of 1971.  As both a singer and composer as well, he was central to the group's greatest commercial success in the mid-1970s and was the writer and vocalist on the Allmans' hit single \"[[Ramblin' Man (The Allman Brothers Band song)|Ramblin' Man]]\". \n\nEarly in his career Betts was best noted for collaboration with Duane Allman,<ref name=Tdrozodowski>{{cite web|url=http://www.gibson.com/en-us/Lifestyle/Features/Come%20and%20Go%20Blues_%20The%20Incredi|title=Come and Go Blues: The Incredible Guitarists of the Allman Brothers|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100126202416/http://www.gibson.com/en-us/Lifestyle/Features/Come%20and%20Go%20Blues_%20The%20Incredi|archive-date=January 26, 2010}}</ref> the twosome introducing melodic twin guitar harmony and counterpoint, which, according to ''Guitar World'' \"rewrote the rules for how two rock guitarists can work together, completely scrapping the traditional rhythm/lead roles to stand toe to toe\".<ref name=\"GW July 2009\">{{cite magazine|title=The Allman Brothers Band: The Road Goes on Forever|magazine=Guitar World|date=July 20, 2009|url=http://www.guitarworld.com/article/the_allman_brothers_band_the_road_goes_on_forever|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100202053024/http://www.guitarworld.com/article/the_allman_brothers_band_the_road_goes_on_forever|archive-date=February 2, 2010}}</ref> Betts initially gained renown for his epic [[instrumental]], \"[[In Memory of Elizabeth Reed]]\", from the Band's second album, ''[[Idlewild South]]'', followed by his striking guitar duet-driven \"[[Blue Sky (song)|Blue Sky]]\", which not only was his first band vocal but signaled a dramatic new sound and potential direction for it.  \n\nIn the wake of Duane's death the group indeed followed both Betts' musical direction and band leadership, exploding into commercial success in 1973 upon the introduction of the [[Country music|Country]]-influenced ''[[Brothers and Sisters (album)|Brothers and Sisters]]'', and the chart success of its catchy Betts-written hits, exuberant \"Ramblin' Man\" and the melodic instrumental \"[[Jessica (instrumental)|Jessica]]\".\n\nThe band went through a hiatus in the late 1970s, during which time Betts, like many of the other band members, pursued a solo career and side projects under such names as Great Southern and The Dickey Betts Band.  The Allman Brothers reformed in 1979, with [[Dan Toler]] taking the second guitar role alongside Betts.  In 1982, it broke up a second time, during which break Betts formed the group [[Betts, Hall, Leavell and Trucks]], which lasted until 1984.  A third reformation occurred in 1989, with [[Warren Haynes]] then joining Betts on guitar. \n\nBetts was ousted from the band in 2000 over a conflict regarding his continued drug and alcohol abuse; he never played with them again, nor would he appear with other former band members for reunions or side projects.

He started playing ukulele at the age of five and, as his hands got bigger, moved on to mandolin, banjo, and guitar.\n\n==Career==\nBy the age of sixteen Betts was feeling the need for something \"a little faster\", and played in a series of rock bands on the Florida circuit, up the East Coast and into the Midwest.  In 1967 he formed the Second Coming in Florida with [[Berry Oakley]]. According to its composer, [[Rick Derringer]], the group called the Jokers referenced in \"[[Rock and Roll, Hoochie Koo]]\" was one of Betts' early groups of that name.<ref>Scott Freeman, ''Midnight Riders'', pp. 41–42</ref>\n\n=== Early Allman Brothers Band years ===\nIn 1969, [[Duane Allman]], a veteran of the South's \"Chitlin' Circuit\" of roadhouses and small local venues who'd gone on to form several bands with recording contracts, was casting for talent to build another around.  A successful session player, he'd gained a deal with [[Southern soul]] impresario [[Phil Walden]], who planned to back a [[power trio]] featuring Allman.
