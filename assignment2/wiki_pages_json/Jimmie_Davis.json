At the time, Shreveport had the [[city commission]] form of government. After four years in Shreveport City Hall, Davis was elected in 1942 to the [[Louisiana Public Service Commission]]. The rate-making body meets in the capital, Baton Rouge. He was elected during his term as governor and left after two years.\n\n===First term as governor (1944–1948)===\n{{See also|Louisiana gubernatorial election, 1944}}\nDavis was elected governor as a Democrat in 1944. Among those eliminated in the primary were [[Louisiana State Legislature|State Senator]] [[Ernest S. Clements]] of [[Oberlin, Louisiana|Oberlin]] in [[Allen Parish, Louisiana|Allen Parish]], freshman [[U.S. Representative]] [[James H. Morrison]] of [[Hammond, Louisiana|Hammond]] in [[Tangipahoa Parish]], and [[Sam Caldwell]], the [[List of mayors of Shreveport, Louisiana|mayor of Shreveport]]. Davis and Caldwell had served together earlier in Shreveport municipal government.\n\nIn the [[runoff election|runoff]], Davis defeated [[Lewis L. Morgan]], an elderly attorney and former [[U.S. representative]] from [[Covington, Louisiana|Covington]], the seat of [[St. Tammany Parish]], who had been backed by former Governor [[Earl Kemp Long]] and [[mayor of New Orleans|New Orleans Mayor]] [[Robert Maestri]]. In the runoff, Davis received 251,228 (53.6 percent) to Morgan's 217,915 (46.4 percent).\n\nDavis pleased white liberals with his appointments to high positions of two of the leaders of the [[Impeachment in the United States|impeachment]] effort against [[Huey Long]]. He named [[Cecil Morgan]] of Shreveport to the Louisiana Civil Service Commission. Morgan was succeeded in the Louisiana House by [[Rupert Peyton]] of Shreveport, who also served as an aide to Davis. In addition, Davis retained the anti-Long [[Ralph Norman Bauer]] of [[St. Mary Parish, Louisiana|St. Mary Parish]] as House speaker, a selection made originally in 1940 by Sam Jones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lahistory.org/site36.php|title=Smith, James Monroe|work=A Dictionary of Louisiana Biography ([[Louisiana Historical Association]])|access-date=March 25, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160716204559/http://www.lahistory.org/site36.php|archive-date=July 16, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nEarl Long was seeking the [[Lieutenant Governor of Louisiana|lieutenant governorship]] on the Lewis Morgan \"ticket\" and led in the first primary in 1944, but he lost the runoff to [[J.

In a later study of this election, three Louisiana State University [[political science|political scientist]]s described him by the following:\n\n<blockquote>Davis has all the external attributes of a \"man of the people\", but his serious political connections seem to be with the [parish-seat] elite and its allies, particularly the major industrial combinations of the state. He is in many respects a toned-down version of the old-style southern politician who could spellbound the mass of voters into supporting him regardless of the effects of his programs on their welfare. ... Davis creates the perfect image of a man to be trusted and one whose intense calm is calculated to bring rational balance into the political life of the state.<ref>William C. Havard, Rudolf Heberle, and [[Perry H. Howard]], ''The Louisiana Elections of 1960'', [[Baton Rouge]]: [[Louisiana State University]] Studies, 1963, pg. 40</ref></blockquote>\n\nDavis was running at a time when African Americans in the civil rights movement were seeking social justice and restoration of their constitutional rights. In 1954 the US Supreme Court had ruled in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' that segregation in public schools was unconstitutional and urged states to integrate their facilities. With a pledge to fight for continued [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] in public education, Davis won the Democratic [[gubernatorial]] nomination over a crowded field.\n\nDavis ran second in the primary to [[deLesseps Story Morrison|\"Chep\" Morrison]], considered an anti-Long liberal by Louisiana standards. He defeated Morrison in the party runoff held on January 9, 1960. As African Americans (who had supported the Republican Party after the Civil War) were still largely [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised]] in Louisiana, the Democratic primary was the only competitive race for office in the one-party state.\n\nIt has been reported that had General [[Curtis LeMay]] turned down [[George C. Wallace]]'s offer to be his candidate for vice president in 1968 on the [[American Independent Party]] ticket, that Wallace was ready to announce Davis as his selection for vice president. Other sources say Wallace's second choice was the former [[governor of Arkansas]] [[Orval Faubus]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,902367,00.html|title=The Campaign: George's General|date=October 11, 1968|website=Content.time.com|access-date=December 31, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Second term (1960–1964)===\nAs part of his support of segregation, Davis initiated passage of state legislation to create the [[Louisiana State Sovereignty Commission]], which operated from 1960 to 1967.

Anna was born Effie Juanita Carter and had been a founding member of the gospel quartet [[The Chuck Wagon Gang]] along with her father, a sister and a brother.
