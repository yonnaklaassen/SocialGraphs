It is also the title of [[Cooder Graw (album)|their second album]].\n\nThe group formed in 1998. It is perhaps most well known for the song \"Llano Estacado\" that was featured on a series of [[Dodge]] commercials.\n\nCooder Graw is somewhat of an anomaly in the music industry, in that its members' ages at its inception ranged from late-30s to early-50s. The band's singer, Matt Martindale, was the assistant [[district attorney]] of [[Gray County, Texas]], prior to devoting his full attention to the band. Guitarist Kelly Turner was the manager of a manufacturing plant in [[Slaton, Texas]].\n\nThe band was originally called \"Coup de Gr√¢ce,\" but another band was already using that name, so the name was changed to a \"Texas-version\" of the original name. The band's debut album, ''[[Home at the Golden Light]]'', consisted of mostly [[cover version|cover]]s and was self-produced by the band (though [[executive producer]] credit is given to [[Matthew McConaughey]], a [[fraternities and sororities|fraternity]] brother of Matt Martindale). It was released in 1998. The band's first national release, ''[[Cooder Graw (album)|Cooder Graw]]'', was released in late 1999.\n\nCooder Graw has toured extensively throughout [[Texas]] and the [[United States]], both headlining and opening for artists such as [[Willie Nelson]] and [[Alabama (American band)|Alabama]]. The group also played at the premiere of the film ''[[Edtv|EDtv]]'', which starred McConaughey.\n\nIn 2006, Cooder Graw announced that they would cease performing together after the end of the year. Their last show was on December 31, 2006, in Fort Worth, Texas. Lead singer Matt Martindale is still performing occasionally with his new band, The Matt Martindale Band.\n\nWhile Martindale, Turner, and Baker returned to careers outside of music, February 27, 2012, Cooder Graw announced a reunion tour would kick off April 28, 2012, at the Larry Joe Taylor Music Fest with more dates to follow.\n\n==Current==\n\n*Matt Martindale - acoustic guitar, vocals\n*Paul Baker - bass guitar\n*Kelly Turner - lead guitar\n*Kelly Test - drums, backing vocals\n*Carmen Acciaioli - fiddle, mandolin\n*Danny Crelin - pedal steel guitar\n\n==Former members==\n\n*Joe Ammons - drums, vocals\n*Jim Whisenhunt - pedal steel guitar\n*Nick Worley - fiddle, mandolin\n*Jon \"Fish\" Hunt - drums, backing vocals\n\n==Discography==\n===Albums===\n*''Home at the Golden Light'' (1998)\n*''Cooder Graw'' (1999)\n*''Segundo'' (2000)\n*''Shifting Gears'' (2001)\n*''Live at Billy Bob's Texas'' (2002)\n*''Wake Up'' (2004)\n*''Big Sign'' (2009)\n*''Love to Live By'' (2016)\n\n===Music videos===\n*\"Junior's in the Yard\"\n*\"Better Days\"\n*\"Love to Live By\"\n\n===Compilations===\n*''Texas Road Trip'' - \"18 Wheels of Loving\" (2001)\n*''Brewed in Texas'' - \"Whiskey Bent And Hellbound\" (2002)\n*''Cow Hear This'' - \"Better Days\" (2002)\n*''Compadre's Texas Lovers'' - \"Ain't Livin' Long Like This\" (2003)\n*''Red River Tribute'' (tribute to [[Waylon Jennings]]) - \"Rainy Day Woman\" (2003)\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.coodergraw.com/]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Musical groups from Lubbock, Texas]]\n[[Category:Country music groups from Texas]]\n[[Category:Musicians from Amarillo, Texas]]"
