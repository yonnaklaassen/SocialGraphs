In the early 1950s he moved to [[Atlanta]], Georgia, where he formed his own band, The Peach Tree Boys. Greene was lead vocalist, drummer, and guitarist for the group for eight years.<ref name=Greene/> In 1959, he moved back to Tennessee and settled in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] and formed another band, The Tennessee Mountain Boys. A major career break came Greene's way in 1961 when his band served as the opening act for [[Ernest Tubb]]. Impressed, Tubb asked Greene to become a part of his backing band, the Texas Troubadors in 1962.<ref name=Opry/>\n\n==Career==\n===Success and \"There Goes My Everything\"===\nFor the next few years, Jack Greene was a drummer, guitarist, vocalist, and [[master of ceremonies]] for the Troubadors' performances. He soon began serving as opening act on a regular basis for Tubb, as well as playing in the band.<ref name=Opry/> In 1964, Jack released his first solo record with ''The Last Letter''. The song originally appeared on one of Ernest Tubb's live albums but drew enough attention that Tubb's record label, [[Decca Records]], released it as a single. Another single, \"Don't You Ever Get Tired (Of Hurting Me)\", followed in 1965 but failed to make the country music charts, having the bad luck to come out at the same time as [[Ray Price (musician)|Ray Price]]'s version. Tubb encouraged Jack Greene to leave the Texas Troubadors and pursue a solo career. Said Greene in an interview, \"Ernest told me 'Son I believe it's time to go.' But also said 'If you can't make it you can always come back and be a Troubador'.\"<ref name=Opry/>\n\nGreene's first Top 40 hit came in early 1966 with \"Ever Since My Baby Went Away\", peaking at No.&nbsp;37. Later that year, Decca released what would become his signature song, \"There Goes My Everything\". The song reached No.&nbsp;1 and stayed on top of the country charts for 7 weeks while becoming a crossover hit. His success continued into 1967 with another No.&nbsp;1 in \"All The Time\" (on top for 5 weeks) and a number 2 hit with \"What Locks The Door\". In 1967, he received the prestigious awards for Male Vocalist of the Year, Single of the Year, and Album of the Year from the [[Country Music Association]]. In all, he recorded nine No.&nbsp;1 country hits on various charts including five No.&nbsp;1 ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' hits. His success continued into 1968 with another No.&nbsp;1 with \"[[You Are My Treasure]]\" and the top 5 hit \"Love Takes Care Of Me\".{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nIn 1969, he had two No.&nbsp;1 hits with \"[[Until My Dreams Come True]]\" and \"[[Statue of a Fool]]\". He completed the year out with the Top 5 \"Back In The Arms Of Love\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Roland|first=Tom|title=All Music Guide to CountryCountry |edition=2 |location=San Francisco|publisher=[[Backbeat Books]]|year=2003|isbn=0-87930-760-9}}</ref> It was also in 1967 that Jack Greene became a member of the Grand Ole Opry.<ref name=Billboard2/> He became an Opry mainstay, performing there frequently each year until his health failed.\n\n===Continued success===\nIn 1970, Greene gained a duet and a touring partner in [[Jeannie Seely]].
