He has released three albums for [[RCA Records]] Nashville (''[[You Won't Ever Be Lonely]]'', ''[[Freedom (Andy Griggs album)|Freedom]]'', and ''[[This I Gotta See]]'') and a fourth (''[[The Good Life (Andy Griggs album)|The Good Life]]'') for [[Montage Music Group]]. These four albums have accounted for 13 singles and 6 Top Tens on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country chart, the highest being \"[[You Won't Ever Be Lonely (song)|You Won't Ever Be Lonely]]\" and \"[[She's More]]\", both of which peaked at #2. He also charted \"Grow Young With You\", a cut from the soundtrack to the film ''[[Where the Heart Is (2000 film)|Where the Heart Is]]''.\n\n==Early life==\nGriggs was born in [[West Monroe, Louisiana]].<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web |last=Wilson |first=MacKenzie |title=Andy Griggs biography |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p366514/biography|pure_url=yes}} |access-date=2009-01-30 |work=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref>  His father, Darrell, died when Griggs was 10, and brother Mason served as the family's father figure until he died of a heart attack at age 22.<ref name=\"cw\">{{cite web|last=Newcomer |first=Wendy |title=Andy Griggs: He heals his past publicity with the hit \"If Heaven\" — and embraces his future privately with a hush-hush wedding. |date=2005-02-18 |url=http://www.countryweekly.com/feature/922 |work=[[Country Weekly]] |access-date=2009-04-24 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090803220718/http://www.countryweekly.com/feature/922 |archive-date=2009-08-03 }}</ref>\n\nHe briefly attended [[Northeast Louisiana University]] before returning to his hometown in the early 1990s, where he became a [[Youth ministry|youth minister]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://cjonline.com/stories/101901/wee_andygriggs.shtml#.WeREI-RDFOw |title=Andy Griggs: Country singer picks up the musical torch of his fallen brother &#124; CJOnline.com |access-date=2017-10-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171016174320/http://cjonline.com/stories/101901/wee_andygriggs.shtml#.WeREI-RDFOw |archive-date=2017-10-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and began a family with his wife. He continued to work on his musical skills, however, and by 1999, he signed to a contract with [[RCA Records]] Nashville.{{cn|date=February 2024}}\n\n==Musical career==\nGriggs' debut album, ''[[You Won't Ever Be Lonely]]'', was issued in 1999 via RCA Records Nashville. Certified [[gold album|gold]] by the [[RIAA]], the album accounted for five singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country singles charts. The first three singles — the title track, \"I'll Go Crazy\" and \"She's More\" — were all Top Ten hits, peaking at number 2, number 10 and number 2 respectively.<ref name=\"whitburn\">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2008|publisher=Record Research, Inc|year=2008|page=172|isbn=978-0-89820-177-2}}</ref> \"You Won't Ever Be Lonely\" also had the sixth-longest chart run on the country charts in the 1990s decade, spending thirty-six weeks on the charts.<ref>Whitburn, p. 644</ref> Following \"She's More\" was a non-album song, \"Grow Young With Me\", recorded as a duet with [[Coley McCabe]], and after that, \"Waitin' on Sundown\" at number 50 and \"You Made Me That Way\" at number 19. Also included on the album was a duet with Griggs' idol [[Waylon Jennings]] in the track \"Shine On Me\", as well as a cover of Jennings' \"Ain't Livin' Long Like This\".\n\nHe released his second album, ''[[Freedom (Andy Griggs album)|Freedom]]'', in 2002. Although its lead-off single \"How Cool Is That\" peaked at number 22, the second single, \"Tonight I Wanna Be Your Man\", became his fourth Top Ten hit at number 7. Closing out this album was \"Practice Life\", a number 33 duet with [[Martina McBride]].\n\nFor 2003 and half of 2004, Griggs was absent from the country charts, although he, [[Montgomery Gentry]], and [[Blake Shelton]] performed uncredited guest vocals on [[Tracy Byrd]]'s 2003 single \"[[The Truth About Men (song)|The Truth About Men]]\". Mid-2004 saw the release of \"[[She Thinks She Needs Me]]\". Co-written by [[Shane Minor]], this song was the first single release from Griggs' third album, ''[[This I Gotta See]]'', also released in 2004.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> Although this song and follow-up \"[[If Heaven]]\" were both number 5 hits on the country charts, the album's third single, \"This I Gotta See\", stopped at number 58, and the fourth single (\"I Never Had a Chance\") failed to chart at all. By 2005, he had left RCA's roster, due to creative differences over his artistic control.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://dailycollegian.com/2006/05/07/countrys-griggs-leaves-rca-continues-with-album-no-4/ |title=Country's Griggs leaves RCA, continues with album No. 4 : The Daily Collegian |access-date=2014-03-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140316055420/http://dailycollegian.com/2006/05/07/countrys-griggs-leaves-rca-continues-with-album-no-4/ |archive-date=2014-03-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, Griggs signed to his second recording contract, this time with [[Montage Music Group]]. His first album for the label, ''[[The Good Life (Andy Griggs album)|The Good Life]]'', produced two low-charting singles in \"Tattoo Rose\" (co-written by Cole Deggs, lead singer of [[Cole Deggs & the Lonesome]]) and \"What If It's Me\". Three years later, he issued \"Can I Get an Amen\".\n\n==Personal life==\nGriggs has been married twice, first to Stephanie Sullivan in February 1995, but they were eventually separated. In 2005 Griggs married Renee, but they also eventually separated.
