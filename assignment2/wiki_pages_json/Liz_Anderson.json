Writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'' Bill Friskics-Warren noted, \"Like her contemporary [[Loretta Lynn]], Ms. Anderson gave voice to female survivors; inhabiting their struggles in a soprano at times alluring, at times sassy.\"<ref name=\"nyt\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/03/arts/music/liz-anderson-who-wrote-hit-country-songs-dies-at-81.html|title=Liz Anderson, Who Wrote Hit Country Songs, Dies at 81|date=November 3, 2011|work=The New York Times|access-date=December 7, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAnderson received two [[Grammy Award]] nominations in 1967, one for \"[[Best Female Country Vocal Performance]]\" for her self-penned, top-5 hit \"[[Mama Spank]]\", and the other for \"Best Country Vocal Group\" for the top-5 hit \"The Game of Triangles\", with [[Bobby Bare]] and [[Norma Jean (singer)|Norma Jean]]. As a songwriter, she scored 26 top 50 hits in the 1960s, more than any other female songwriter that decade in the country music industry.\n\nAnderson also wrote many of the early hits for her daughter, [[Lynn Anderson]],<ref name=\"cmt\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1673564/songwriter-singer-liz-anderson-mother-of-lynn-anderson-dies-at-81.jhtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111112105923/http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1673564/songwriter-singer-liz-anderson-mother-of-lynn-anderson-dies-at-81.jhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 12, 2011|title=Songwriter-Singer Liz Anderson, Mother of Lynn Anderson, Dies at 81|work=[[CMT (American TV channel)|CMT]]|access-date=December 7, 2016}}</ref> whose recording career began less than a year after her mother's. She wrote several hits for other notable artists, including [[Merle Haggard]]. Haggard had his first top 10 and number one hits, respectively, with \"[[(My Friends Are Gonna Be) Strangers]]\" and \"[[The Fugitive (song)|I'm a Lonesome Fugitive]]\", both penned by Anderson. He named his band \"The Strangers\", after the hit \"(My Friends Are Gonna Be) Strangers\".\n\n==Biography==\nBorn Elizabeth Jane Haaby in [[Roseau, Minnesota]],<ref name=\"cmt\"/> on January 13, 1927,<ref name=\"dignity\">{{cite web|url=http://obits.dignitymemorial.com/dignity-memorial/obituary.aspx?n=Elizabeth-Anderson&lc=4881&pid=154430977&mid=4871086&locale=en-US|title=Elizabeth Anderson, 1927-2011|access-date=2012-04-03}}</ref> or March 13, 1930,<ref name=\"nyt\"/> she played the family mandolin as a child and also sang in the local church. At age 13, the family moved west to [[Grand Forks, North Dakota|Grand Forks]], North Dakota. At the age of 16, Liz was married to Casey Anderson and then had her daughter [[Lynn Anderson|Lynn]] a year later. She studied at the Redwood City Business College in [[Redwood City, California|Redwood City]], California, and worked as a secretary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.showboatrecords.com/index.php?p=1089|title=The Cowgirl Way|publisher=Showboat Records|access-date=November 1, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716064409/http://www.showboatrecords.com/index.php?p=1089|archive-date=July 16, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Early career==\nIn 1957, the family moved to [[Sacramento, California]]. The limited popularity at the time of country music in California led Anderson to start writing songs. Casey was a member of the Sheriff's posse, which was going to take part in the ''National Centennial Pony Express Celebration''. Casey convinced his wife to write a song in honor of the [[Pony Express]]. The song was named the official song.<ref name=\"StamblerLandon2000\">{{cite book|last1=Stambler|first1=Irwin |last2=Landon|first2=Grelun |title=Country Music: The Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QAPi0EaJo4wC&pg=PA15|access-date=May 24, 2010|date=June 27, 2000|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0-312-26487-1|pages=14–15}}</ref>\n\nAnderson began publishing her songs and made friends within the burgeoning country music community in Bakersfield during the early 1960s. Some of the first hits from her pen were \"Be Quiet Mind\" by [[Del Reeves]] and \"Pick of the Week\", which was recorded by [[Roy Drusky]] in 1964.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> In 1965, [[Merle Haggard]] recorded her song \"All My Friends Are Gonna Be Strangers\".<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Country Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1993|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-726-6|page=19}}</ref> She won a [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]] award for the song. Anderson published over 260 songs during her career and earned five BMI awards.  Anderson also wrote [[Conway Twitty]]'s first country hit, \"Guess My Eyes Were Bigger Than My Heart\".<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/>  Many major country artists of the 1960s recorded at least one of her songs on their albums, including [[Charley Pride]], [[Tammy Wynette]], [[Ernest Tubb]], [[Loretta Lynn]], [[George Jones]], [[Skeeter Davis]], [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Kitty Wells]], [[Connie Smith]], [[Faron Young]], [[The Browns]], [[Porter Wagoner]], [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], and [[Bill Anderson (singer)|Bill Anderson]].  She was also friends with [[Chart Records]] owner [[Slim Williamson]] (where daughter Lynn recorded) and provided many of the label's artists with songs including [[Connie Eaton]], [[LaWanda Lindsey]], and [[Billy \"Crash\" Craddock]].  Singers who recorded her material in later years included [[Lorrie Morgan]] and [[Mary Lou Turner]].\n\nAnderson demo vocals were noticed by [[RCA Records|RCA]] producer [[Chet Atkins]] who signed her to RCA in 1965. Almost forty at the time, Anderson's year of birth was slightly lowered to 1930 in publicity materials of the era. Anderson's two initial singles fared well and her third, \"Game of Triangles\", with [[Bobby Bare]] and [[Norma Jean (singer)|Norma Jean]] became a top 5 hit.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> In April 1967, Anderson again had a top 5 Country hit, \"Mama Spank\".<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> Among Anderson's most popular recordings were \"Go Now Pay Later\" (1966), \"The Wife of the Party\" (1967), \"Tiny Tears\" (1967),<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> \"Thanks A Lot For Tryin' Anyway\" (1968) (written by [[Jim Glaser]]; one of her few hits written by someone else), and \"Husband Hunting\" (1970).<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/>\n\nAround this same time her only child, daughter Lynn, was rising as a country singer. Anderson wrote a number of her daughter's early hits, including her 1967 debut single \"[[Ride, Ride, Ride]]\",<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> as well as her first big hit, the top 5 \"[[If I Kiss You (Will You Go Away)]]\" (also in 1967). Liz and Lynn had a top 25 duet with  \"Mother May I\" in 1968,<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> and appeared together on a Mother's Day episode of the ''[[Lawrence Welk Show]]'' that May. Lynn would later have her biggest success in the 1970s, becoming one of country music's most successful female vocalists.\n\n==Later career==\nIn 1971, Anderson moved to [[Epic Records]], and released the four charting singles produced by then son-in-law [[Glenn Sutton]] which went no higher than the Country top 60. One of those singles was a [[cover version]] of \"[[I'll Never Fall In Love Again]]\". In 1974 she released a Christmas single, the self-penned \"Christopher the Christmas Seal\", on the small Hobby Horse Records label.\n\nAnderson did not record again until she released a single for the Scorpion Records label in 1978 that did not chart. She continued to write, however, and one of her songs was a top-40 country success for [[Faron Young]] in 1977. In 1979, [[Lorrie Morgan]] had one of her first charted songs with an Anderson composition \"Tell Me I'm Only Dreaming\" which went to number 88 in 1979 and was one of the last charting songs written by Anderson.\n\nHer lone 1980s recording was the album ''My Last Rose'' for Tudor Records which contained original material and covers of well-known songs. In the mid-1990s, Anderson started her own record company, Showboat Records. ''The Cowgirl Way'' was her first album in over a decade. She also recorded an album of Christmas songs and another one of children's songs, most of them written by her. In 2006, Lynn Anderson released an album for the label entitled ''Cowgirl'', composed entirely of songs penned by her mother.\n\n==Discography==\n{{Main article|Liz Anderson discography}}\n* ''[[The Game of Triangles]]'' (1967)\n* ''[[Liz Anderson Sings]]'' (1967)\n* ''[[Cookin' up Hits]]'' (1967)\n* ''[[Liz Anderson Sings Her Favorites]]'' (1968)\n\n==Major country hits written by Liz Anderson==\nAnderson enjoyed her greatest success as a songwriter, receiving many awards for her work, including several [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]] awards. She also served as [[vice president]] of the Nashville Songwriters Association International. The following is a list of her songs which made the top 50 on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'''s country chart (with chart rankings). In 1966 and 1967, Anderson had six top 50 hits as a songwriter each year, believed{{By whom|date=December 2016}} to be a record still to this date among female country music songwriters.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
