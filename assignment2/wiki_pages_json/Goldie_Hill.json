Along with [[Kitty Wells]] and [[Jean Shepard]] she helped set the standard for later women in country music.\n\n==Early life and career==\nHill was born in [[Karnes City, Texas|Karnes City]], Texas in 1933, a small town southeast of [[San Antonio]]. She was the sister of singer Tommy Hill. She also performed with her brothers Tommy and Ken. Then she auditioned as a solo singer at [[Decca Records]]. Her first single, \"Why Talk To My Heart\", was released in 1952.  Hill recorded the song \"[[I Let the Stars Get In My Eyes]]\" the same year a riposte to [[Perry Como]]'s \"[[Don't Let The Stars Get In Your Eyes]]\", written by her brother, Tommy Hill. It became a number 1 hit. In 1954, she followed up with two hit duets with singer [[Justin Tubb]], son of [[Ernest Tubb]]. In the early 1960s, she recorded two albums for Decca Records. She regularly performed on ''[[Louisiana Hayride]]'', ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'' and ''[[Ozark Jubilee]]''. She married country singer [[Carl Smith (country musician)|Carl Smith]] in 1957 and the couple had two sons (Carl, Jr. and Larry Dean), and one daughter (Lori Lynn). They remained married for 47 years until her death. She made a short-lived comeback in the late 1960s with the label [[Epic Records]] under the name Goldie Hill Smith.\n\nOn February 24, 2005, Hill died from complications of [[cancer]]. She was 72 years old.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nucountry.com.au/articles/diary/february2005/260205_goldiehill_obit.htm|title = Dave's Diary - 26/2/05 - Goldie Hill Obituary}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/mar/29/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries|title=Goldie Hill|work=The Guardian|date=28 March 2005 |accessdate=2022-11-14|last1=Clayson |first1=Alan }}</ref> Her husband survived her by 5 years.<ref name=Washpost>{{Cite news |last=McArdle |first=Terrence  |title='Country Gentleman' had 21 consecutive Top 10 hits |newspaper=The Washington Post |location=Washington, DC  |pages=B4  |date=January 23, 2010 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/22/AR2010012204551.html}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n{{Infobox artist discography\n| Artist      = Goldie Hill\n| Image       =\n| Caption     = \n| Studio      = 6\n| Singles     = 35\n| Option      = 1\n| Option name = No. 1 Singles (Overall) \n}}\n\n===Albums===\n{| class=wikitable style=text-align:center;\n|-\n!
