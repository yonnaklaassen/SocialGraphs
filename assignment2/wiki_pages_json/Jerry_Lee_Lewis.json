Nicknamed \"'''The Killer'''\", he was described as \"[[rock 'n' roll]]'s first great wild man\". A pioneer of rock and roll and [[rockabilly]] music, Lewis made his first recordings in 1952 at [[Cosimo Matassa]]'s J&M Studio in [[New Orleans]], Louisiana, and early recordings in 1956 at [[Sun Records]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. \"[[Crazy Arms]]\" sold 300,000 copies in the Southern United States, but it was his 1957 hit \"[[Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On]]\" that shot Lewis to worldwide fame. He followed this with the major hits \"[[Great Balls of Fire]]\", \"[[Breathless (Jerry Lee Lewis song)|Breathless]]\", and \"[[High School Confidential (Jerry Lee Lewis song)|High School Confidential]]\".\n\nHis rock and roll career faltered in the wake of his marriage to [[Myra Gale Brown]], his 13-year-old first cousin once removed. His popularity quickly eroded following the scandal, and with few exceptions, such as a cover of [[Ray Charles]]'s \"[[What'd I Say]]\", he did not have much chart success in the early 1960s. His live performances at this time were increasingly wild and energetic. His 1964 live album ''[[Live at the Star Club, Hamburg]]'' is regarded by many music journalists and fans as one of the wildest and greatest live rock albums ever. In 1968, Lewis made a transition into [[country music]] and had hits with songs such as \"[[Another Place, Another Time (Del Reeves song)|Another Place, Another Time]]\". This reignited his career, and throughout the late 1960s and 1970s, he regularly topped the country-western charts; throughout his seven-decade career, Lewis had 30 songs reach the Top 10 on the [[Hot Country Songs|''Billboard'' Country and Western Chart]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Myers |first=Marc |date=October 24, 2014 |title=Jerry Lee Lewis, the Enduring Rebel of Rock 'n' Roll |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/jerry-lee-lewis-the-enduring-rebel-of-rocknroll-1413908005 |website=The Wall Street Journal |access-date=March 8, 2017 |archive-date=March 21, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170321082649/https://www.wsj.com/articles/jerry-lee-lewis-the-enduring-rebel-of-rocknroll-1413908005 |url-status=live }}</ref> His No. 1 country hits included \"[[To Make Love Sweeter for You]]\", \"[[There Must Be More to Love Than This (song)|There Must Be More to Love Than This]]\", \"[[Would You Take Another Chance on Me]]\", and \"[[Me and Bobby McGee]]\".\n\nLewis's successes continued throughout the decades, and he embraced his rock and roll past with songs such as a cover of [[The Big Bopper]]'s \"[[Chantilly Lace (song)|Chantilly Lace]]\" and [[Mack Vickery]]'s \"Rockin' My Life Away\". In the 21st century, Lewis continued to tour worldwide and released new albums. His 2006 album ''[[Last Man Standing (Jerry Lee Lewis album)|Last Man Standing]]'' was his best-selling release, with over a million copies worldwide. This was followed by ''[[Mean Old Man]]'' in 2010, another of his bestselling albums.\n\nLewis had a dozen [[Music recording certification|gold records]] in rock and country. He won four Grammy awards, including a [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] and two [[Grammy Hall of Fame]] Awards. Lewis was inducted into the inaugural class of the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1986, and his pioneering contribution to the genre was recognized by the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]]. He was also a member of the inaugural class inducted into the [[Memphis Music Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Memphis Music Hall of Fame |url=http://memphismusichalloffame.com/ |access-date=October 12, 2016 |website=Memphismusichalloffame.com |archive-date=October 9, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009220210/http://memphismusichalloffame.com/ |url-status=live }}</ref> He was inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum|Country Music Hall of Fame]] in 2022.

He grew up in an impoverished farming family in Eastern Louisiana. In his youth, he began playing the piano with two of his cousins, [[Mickey Gilley]] (later a popular country music singer) and [[Jimmy Swaggart]] (later a popular televangelist). His parents [[Mortgage loan|mortgaged]] their farm to buy him a piano. Lewis was influenced by a piano-playing older cousin, [[Carl McVoy]] (who later recorded with [[Bill Black]]'s Combo), the radio, and the sounds from Haney's Big House, a black [[juke joint]] across the tracks.<ref>{{Cite web |date=April 16, 2004 |title=Natchez Under The Hill Saloon – Natchez Mississippi |url=http://www.underthehillsaloon.com/custom/webpage.cfm?content=newsletter&id=50 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040716210854/http://www.underthehillsaloon.com/custom/webpage.cfm?content=newsletter&id=50 |archive-date=July 16, 2004 |access-date=July 11, 2015 |publisher=Underthehillsaloon.com}}</ref> On November 19, 1949, Lewis made his first public performance of his career, playing with a [[country and western]] band at a car dealership in Ferriday.

When Lewis daringly played a [[boogie-woogie]] rendition of \"My God Is Real\" at a church assembly, it ended his association with the school the same night. Pearry Green, then president of the student body, related how during a talent show Lewis played some \"worldly\" music. The next morning, the [[Dean (education)|dean]] of the school called Lewis and Green into his office to expel them. After that incident, he went home and started playing at clubs in and around Ferriday and [[Natchez, Mississippi]], becoming part of the burgeoning new [[rock and roll]] sound and cutting his first demo recording in 1952 for [[Cosimo Matassa]] in New Orleans.<ref name=jms>{{Cite web |last=Halsey |first=Jay |year=2021 |title=The Killer Rocks J&M |url=http://cosimocode.com/killer.html |website=The Cosimo Code |access-date=October 29, 2022 |archive-date=September 2, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220902142443/http://cosimocode.com/killer.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Tomko|first=Gene|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5ZKzDwAAQBAJ|title=Encyclopedia of Louisiana Musicians: Jazz, Blues, Cajun, Creole, Zydeco, Swamp Pop, and Gospel|publisher=Louisiana State University Press|year=2020|isbn=978-0807169322|location=Baton Rouge|pages=160|access-date=December 1, 2021|archive-date=July 13, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230713173501/https://books.google.com/books?id=5ZKzDwAAQBAJ|url-status=live}}</ref> Around 1955, he traveled to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], where he played in clubs and attempted to build interest, but was turned down by the [[Grand Ole Opry]], as he was already at the [[Louisiana Hayride]] country stage and radio show in [[Shreveport]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=March 27, 2012 |title=Jerry Lee Lewis {{!}} Sun Record Company |url=https://www.sunrecords.com/artists/jerry-lee-lewis |access-date=March 21, 2021 |archive-date=February 4, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210204174946/https://www.sunrecords.com/artists/jerry-lee-lewis |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===J&M Studio===\nLewis made his first recordings in 1952 at [[Cosimo Matassa]]'s [[J&M Recording Studio]] in [[New Orleans]], Louisiana.

In December 1956, Lewis began recording prolifically as a solo artist and as a [[session musician]] for other Sun artists, including [[Carl Perkins]] and [[Johnny Cash]]. His distinctive piano playing can be heard on many tracks recorded at Sun in late 1956 and early 1957, including Carl Perkins's \"[[Matchbox (song)|Matchbox]]\", \"[[Your True Love]]\", and \"Put Your Cat Clothes On\" and [[Billy Lee Riley]]'s \"Flyin' Saucers Rock'n'Roll\".\n\nOn December 4, 1956, [[Elvis Presley]] dropped in on Phillips to pay a social visit while Perkins was in the studio cutting new tracks with Lewis backing him on piano. Johnny Cash was also there watching Perkins. The four then started an impromptu [[jam session]] and Phillips left the tape running.<ref name=pc8 /> These recordings, almost half of which were gospel songs, were released on CD as ''[[Million Dollar Quartet]]''. Tracks also include Elvis Presley's \"[[Don't Be Cruel]]\" and \"[[Paralyzed (Elvis Presley song)|Paralyzed]]\", [[Chuck Berry]]'s \"[[Brown Eyed Handsome Man]]\", and [[Pat Boone]]'s \"Don't Forbid Me\".\n[[File:Great Balls of Fire - You Win Again - Cash Box ad 1957.jpg|thumb|''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cash Box]]'' advertisement, November 16, 1957]] \nLewis's own singles (on which he was billed as \"Jerry Lee Lewis And His Pumping Piano\") advanced his career as a soloist during 1957, with hits such as \"[[Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On]]\", a [[Big Maybelle]] cover, and \"[[Great Balls of Fire]]\", his biggest hit, bringing him international fame and criticism of the songs, which prompted some radio stations to boycott them. In 2005, \"Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On\" was selected for permanent preservation in the [[National Recording Registry]] of the [[Library of Congress]]. According to several first-hand sources, including [[Johnny Cash]], Lewis, a devout Christian, was troubled by the sinful nature of his own material, which he believed was leading him and his audience to [[Hell]].<ref>Cash, Johnny (1997). ''[[Cash: The Autobiography]]''. p. 98.</ref> This aspect of Lewis's character was depicted in [[Waylon Payne]]'s portrayal of Lewis in the 2005 film ''[[Walk the Line]]'', based on Cash's autobiographies.\n\nAs part of his stage act, Lewis pounded the keys with his heel, kicked the [[piano bench]] aside and played standing, raking his hands up and down the keys, sat on the keyboard and stood on the piano.

The team at Smash (a division of [[Mercury Records]]) came up with \"I'm on Fire\", a song that they felt would be perfect for Lewis and, as [[Colin Escott]] writes in the sleeve to the retrospective ''A Half Century of Hits'', \"Mercury held the presses, thinking they had found Lewis's comeback hit, and it might have happened if [[the Beatles]] hadn't arrived in America, changing radio playlists almost overnight.

In June 1963, Lewis returned to the UK for the first time since the scandal that nearly ended his career five years earlier, to headline a performance on the ''[[MV Royal Daffodil (1939)|MV Royal Daffodil]]'', for a [[English Channel|cross-channel]] rock and roll cruise from [[Southend-on-Sea|Southend, Essex]], to [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne, France]].

The results were sonically astonishing, with Bonomo observing, \"Detractors complain of the album's crashing noisiness, the lack of subtlety with which Jerry Lee revisits the songs, the fact that the piano is mixed too loudly, but what is certain is that Siggi Loch on this spring evening captured something brutally honest about the Killer, about the primal and timeless centre of the very best rock & roll...\" The album showcases Lewis's skills as a pianist and singer, honed by relentless touring. In a 5-out-of-5-stars review, Milo Miles wrote in ''Rolling Stone'' magazine that \"''Live at the Star Club, Hamburg'' is not an album, it's a crime scene: Jerry Lee Lewis slaughters his rivals in a thirteen-song set that feels like one long convulsion.\"\n\n===Country comeback===\n[[File:Carl Perkins Roy Orbison Johnny Cash Jerry Lee Lewis 1977.jpg|thumb|left|Lewis performing with [[Roy Orbison]], [[Johnny Cash]] and [[Carl Perkins]] on ''The Johnny Cash Christmas Special'' in November 1977]]\nFrustrated by Smash's inability to score a hit, Lewis was planning on leaving the label when promotions manager [[Eddie Kilroy]] pitched the idea of cutting a pure country record in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]. With nothing to lose, Lewis agreed to record the [[Jerry Chesnut]] song \"[[Another Place, Another Time (Del Reeves song)|Another Place, Another Time]]\", which was released as a single on March 9, 1968, and, to everyone's amazement, shot up the country charts. At the time of the release, Lewis had been playing [[Iago]] in a rock and roll adaptation of ''Othello'' called ''Catch My Soul'' in Los Angeles but was soon rushed back to Nashville to record another batch of songs with producer [[Jerry Kennedy]]. What followed was a string of hits that no one could have predicted, although country music always remained a major part of Lewis's repertoire. As Colin Escott observes in the sleeve to the 1995 compilation ''Killer Country'', the conversion to country music in 1968 \"looked at the time like a radical shift, but it was neither as abrupt nor as unexpected as it seemed. Jerry had always recorded country music, and his country breakthrough 'Another Place, Another Time' had been preceded by countless country records starting with his first, '[[Crazy Arms]]', in 1956.\" The last time Lewis had had a song on the country charts was with \"Pen and Paper\" in 1964, which had reached number 36, but \"Another Place, Another Time\" would go all the way to number 4 and remain on the charts for 17 weeks.\n\nBetween 1968 and 1977, Lewis had 17 Top 10 hit singles on the Billboard country chart, including four chart-toppers. Hits include \"What's Made Milwaukee Famous (Has Made A Loser Out of Me)\", \"To Make Love Sweeter For You\", \"She Still Comes Around (To Love What's Left of Me)\", \"Since I Met You Baby\", \"Once More With Feeling\", \"One Has My Name (The Other Has My Heart)\", and \"Sometimes A Memory Ain't Enough\". The production on his early country albums, such as ''[[Another Place, Another Time (album)|Another Place, Another Time]]'' and ''She Even Woke Me Up To Say Goodbye'', was sparse, quite different from the slick \"[[Nashville sound]]\" that was predominant on country radio at the time, and also expressed a full commitment by Lewis to a country audience. The songs still featured Lewis's inimitable piano flourishes, but critics were most taken aback by the rock and roll pioneer's effortlessly soulful vocals, which possessed an emotional resonance on par with the most respected country singers of the time, such as [[George Jones]] and [[Merle Haggard]]. In his book ''Jerry Lee Lewis: His Own Story'', biographer Rick Bragg notes that the songs Lewis was recording \"were of the kind they were starting to call 'hard country', not because it had a rock beat or crossed over into rock in a real way, but because it was more substantial than the cloying, overproduced mess out there on country radio\".\n\nIn a remarkable turnaround, Lewis became the most bankable country star in the world. He was so huge in 1970 that his former Smash producer [[Shelby Singleton]], who purchased [[Sun Records]] from [[Sam Phillips]] in July 1969, wasted no time in repackaging many of Lewis's old country recordings with such effectiveness that many fans assumed they were recent releases. One of his later unreleased Sun recordings, \"[[One Minute Past Eternity]]\", was issued as a single and soared to number 2 on the country chart, following Lewis's recent [[Mercury Records|Mercury]] hit \"She Even Woke Me Up To Say Goodbye\". Singleton would milk these unreleased recordings for years, following ''The Golden Cream of the Country'' with ''[[A Taste of Country]]'' later in 1970.\n\n===Grand Ole Opry appearance===\nLewis played the [[Grand Ole Opry]] only once, on January 20, 1973. As Colin Escott writes in the liner notes to ''A Half Century of Hits'', he had maintained an ambivalence to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Music City]] ever since he was turned away as an aspiring musician before his glory days at [[Sun Records]]: \"It was 18 years since he had left [[Nashville]] broke and disheartened...Lewis was never truly accepted in Nashville. He didn't move there and didn't [[schmooze]] there. He didn't fit in with the family values crowd. Lewis family values weren't necessarily worse, but they were different.\"<ref name=\"Escott\"/>\n\nAs recounted in a 2015 online ''Rolling Stone'' article by Beville Dunkerly, Lewis opened with his comeback single \"[[Another Place, Another Time (Del Reeves song)|Another Place, Another Time]]\". Ignoring his allotted time constraints—and, thus, commercial breaks—Lewis played for 40 minutes (the average Opry performance is two songs, for about eight minutes of stage time maximum) and invited [[Del Wood]]—the one member of the Opry who had been kind to him when he had been there as a teenager—out on stage to sing with him. He also blasted through \"Whole Lotta Shakin' Going On\", \"Workin' Man Blues\", \"Good Golly, Miss Molly\", and a number of other classics.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Dunkerly, Beville |date=January 20, 2015 |title=Flashback: Jerry Lee Lewis Drops an F-Bomb on the Grand Ole Opry |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/flashback-jerry-lee-lewis-drops-an-f-bomb-on-the-grand-ole-opry-167176/ |access-date=September 30, 2020 |magazine=Rolling Stone |archive-date=October 21, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201021172629/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/flashback-jerry-lee-lewis-drops-an-f-bomb-on-the-grand-ole-opry-167176/ |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===''The Session'' and ''Southern Roots''===\n[[File:JerryLee Lewis 1977.jpg|thumb|right|Lewis performing in 1977]]\nLewis returned to the pop charts with \"[[Me and Bobby McGee]]\" in 1971 and \"[[Chantilly Lace (song)|Chantilly Lace]]\" in 1972, and this, coupled with a revitalized public interest in vintage [[rock and roll]], inspired Mercury to fly Lewis to London in 1973 to record with a cadre of British and Irish musicians, including [[Rory Gallagher]], [[Kenney Jones]], and Albert Lee. By all accounts the sessions were tense. The remake of Lewis's old Sun cut \"Drinking Wine Spo-Dee-O-Dee\" was the album's hit single, reaching number 20 on the ''Billboard'' country chart and peaking at number 41 on the pop chart. ''The Session'' was his highest pop charting album since 1964's ''[[Golden Hits of Jerry Lee Lewis]]'', hitting number 37. It did far better on the country albums chart, rising to number 4. Later that year, he went to Memphis and recorded ''[[Southern Roots: Back Home to Memphis]]'', a soul-infused rock album produced by Huey Meaux. According to Rick Bragg's authorized 2014 biography, \"the Killer\" was in a foul mood when he showed up at Trans Maximus Studios in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] to record: \"During these sessions, he insulted the producer, threatened to kill a photographer, and drank and medicated his way into but not out of a fog.\" During one exchange that can be heard on the 2013 reissue ''Southern Roots: The Original Sessions'', Meaux asks Lewis, \"Do you wanna try one?\", meaning a take, to which Lewis replies, \"If you got enough fuckin' sense to cut it.\"<ref>{{Cite web |last=Little |first=Michael H. |date=September 29, 2020 |title=Graded on a Curve: Jerry Lee Lewis, Southern Roots: Back Home to Memphis |url=http://www.thevinyldistrict.com/storefront/2020/09/graded-on-a-curve-jerry-lee-lewis-southern-roots-back-home-to-memphis-2/ |access-date=March 22, 2021 |website=The Vinyl District |archive-date=January 15, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210115110247/http://www.thevinyldistrict.com/storefront/2020/09/graded-on-a-curve-jerry-lee-lewis-southern-roots-back-home-to-memphis-2/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> Lewis was still pumping out country albums, although the hits were beginning to dry up. His last big hit with Mercury was \"Middle Age Crazy\", which made it to number 4 in 1977.\n\n===Later career===\n[[File:Jerry Lee Lewis @ Credicard Hall 01.jpg|thumb|Lewis performing in 2009]]\nIn 1979, Lewis switched record labels to [[Elektra Records|Elektra]] and produced the critically acclaimed ''Jerry Lee Lewis'', although sales were disappointing. In 1986, Lewis was one of the inaugural inductees into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. Although looking frail after several hospitalizations due to stomach problems, Lewis was responsible for beginning an unplanned jam at the end of the evening, which was incorporated into all future events. That year, he returned to Sun Studio in Memphis to team up with Orbison, Cash, and Perkins along with longtime admirers like [[John Fogerty]] to create the album ''[[Class of '55]]''.\n\nIn 1989, a major motion picture based on his early life in rock and roll, ''[[Great Balls of Fire! (film)|Great Balls of Fire!]]'', brought him back into the public eye, especially when he decided to re-record all his songs for the movie soundtrack. The film was based on the book by Lewis's ex-wife, Myra Gale Lewis, and starred [[Dennis Quaid]] as Lewis, [[Winona Ryder]] as Myra, and [[Alec Baldwin]] as Jimmy Swaggart. The movie focuses on Lewis's early career and his relationship with Myra and ends with the scandal of the late 1950s. A year later, in 1990, Lewis made minor news when a new song he recorded called \"It Was the Whiskey Talkin' (Not Me)\" was included in the soundtrack to the hit movie ''[[Dick Tracy (1990 film)|Dick Tracy]]''. The song is also heard in the movie, playing on the radio. The public downfall of his cousin, [[televangelist]] [[Jimmy Swaggart]] around the same time, resulted in more adverse publicity to a troubled family. Swaggart is also a piano player, as is another cousin, country music star [[Mickey Gilley]]. All three listened to the same music in their youth and frequented Haney's Big House, the Ferriday club that featured black blues acts. Lewis and Swaggart had a complex relationship over the years.\n\n[[File:JerryLeeLewis.jpg|thumb|left|Lewis performing at the Rhythm Festival in [[Bedford, England|Bedford]], England, in 2006]]\nIn 1998, Lewis toured Europe with [[Chuck Berry]] and [[Little Richard]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=RHOF Archived Reviews |url=http://www.rockabillyhall.com/Rev9804.MiroS01.html |access-date=March 22, 2021 |website=Rockabillyhall.com |archive-date=September 17, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210917123541/http://www.rockabillyhall.com/Rev9804.MiroS01.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> On February 12, 2005, he was given a [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award|Lifetime Achievement Award]] by [[The Recording Academy]].<ref name=\":2\" /> On September 26, 2006, a new album titled ''[[Last Man Standing (Jerry Lee Lewis album)|Last Man Standing]]'' was released, featuring many of rock and roll's elite as guest stars.

My dad collected [[George Shearing]] records, but this was the first time I heard someone beat the shit out of a piano.

Those records had such a huge effect on me, and they were just so great. I learned to play like that.\" Lewis was primarily known for his \"[[boogie-woogie]]\" style, which is characterized by a regular left-hand bass figure and dancing beat, but his command of the instrument and highly individualistic style set him apart.

Lewis had a recorded argument with [[Sam Phillips]] during the recording session for \"[[Great Balls of Fire]]\", a song he initially refused to record because he considered it blasphemous (\"How can... How can the devil save souls? What are you ''talkin' about''?\" he asks Phillips during one heated exchange.) During the famous [[Million Dollar Quartet]] jam involving Lewis, Elvis Presley, Carl Perkins, and Johnny Cash, they performed several gospel songs. Lewis's biographer [[Rick Bragg]] explains that part of the reason the recording only features Lewis and Elvis singing is because \"only Elvis and Jerry Lee [were] raised in the [[Assemblies of God|Assembly of God]]\", and {{\"'}}Johnny and Carl didn't really know the words... they was [[Baptists]]', [Lewis] said, and therefore deprived.\"<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Bragg |first=Rick |author-link=Rick Bragg |date=October–November 2014 |title=Jerry Lee and Me |url=http://www.gardenandgun.com/print/article/jerry-lee-and-me |url-status=dead |journal=[[Garden & Gun]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121073447/http://www.gardenandgun.com/print/article/jerry-lee-and-me |archive-date=November 21, 2015 |access-date=October 7, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1990 documentary ''The Jerry Lee Lewis Story'', Lewis said to the interviewer, \"The Bible doesn't even speak of religion. No word of religion is even in the Bible. ''Sanctification!'' Are you sanctified? Have you been ''saved''? See, I was a good preacher, I know my Bible? I find myself falling short of the glory of God.\"\n\nGospel music was a staple of his performing repertoire.

Later that night, Lewis was at a [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] nightclub called the Vapors drinking champagne when he was given a gun. Lewis suddenly remembered that Elvis wanted to see him and, climbing aboard his new [[Lincoln Continental]] with the loaded pistol on the dash and a bottle of champagne under his arm, tore off for Graceland. Just before three o'clock in the morning, Lewis accidentally smashed into the famous Graceland gates.\n\nPresley's astonished cousin Harold Lloyd was manning the gate and watched Lewis attempt to hurl the champagne bottle out the car window, not realizing the window was rolled up, smashing both. Bragg reports that Lewis denies ever intending to do Presley harm, that the two were friends, but \"Elvis, watching on the [[closed-circuit television]], told guards to call the police. The [[Memphis police]] found the gun in the car and put Lewis, protesting, hollering, threatening them, away in handcuffs.\" Lewis said, \"The cops asked Elvis, 'What do you want us to do? And Elvis told 'em, 'Lock him up.' That hurt my feelings. To be scared of me – knowin' me the way he did – was ridiculous.\" Lewis was charged with carrying a pistol and public drunkenness. Released on a $250 bond, his defiant mugshot was wired around the world. Presley himself died at Graceland nine months later.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Tosches |first=Nick |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ALrR8lHmv44C&pg=PT86 |title=Country: The Twisted Roots Of Rock 'n' Roll |date=2009 |publisher=Hachette Books |isbn=978-0-7867-5098-6 |access-date=August 17, 2015 |archive-date=July 13, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230713173511/https://books.google.com/books?id=ALrR8lHmv44C&pg=PT86 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine |date=November 4, 2014 |title=The Killer at Peace: Jerry Lee Lewis' Golden Years |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/the-killer-at-peace-jerry-lee-lewis-golden-years-47174/ |magazine=Rolling Stone |page=3 |access-date=October 14, 2019 |archive-date=August 18, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190818112008/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/the-killer-at-peace-jerry-lee-lewis-golden-years-47174/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Jerry Lee Lewis |url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/mugshots/celebrity/music/jerry-lee-lewis |website=The Smoking Gun |date=June 12, 2014 |access-date=August 17, 2015 |archive-date=September 15, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915081623/http://www.thesmokinggun.com/mugshots/celebrity/music/jerry-lee-lewis |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Debt===\n[[File:Jerry Lee Lewis Ranch DeSoto County MS 006.jpg|thumb|The gate to Lewis's ranch in [[Nesbit, Mississippi]]]]\nIn 1979, the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] seized property from Lewis to compensate a $274,000 tax debt.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |date=November 9, 1988 |title=Jerry Lee Lewis Files Bankruptcy Petition |url=https://www.apnews.com/14622642563978a1739790fcb13843cf |website=Apnews.com |access-date=August 18, 2019 |archive-date=August 18, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190818111948/https://www.apnews.com/14622642563978a1739790fcb13843cf |url-status=live }}</ref> The property included several automobiles, a tractor, five motorcycles, jewelry, musical instruments, home entertainment equipment, and firearms.
