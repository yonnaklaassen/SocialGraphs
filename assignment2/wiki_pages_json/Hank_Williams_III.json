He was the drummer of [[hardcore punk]] band [[Arson Anthem]] and bassist of [[Phil Anselmo]]'s band [[Superjoint Ritual]]. He has released eleven studio albums, including five for [[Curb Records]].\n\nWilliams is the grandson of [[Hank Williams]] and the son of [[Hank Williams Jr.]] He is also the nephew of [[Jett Williams]], the half-brother of [[Holly Williams (musician)|Holly Williams]], and the father of [[Coleman Williams]].\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early career===\nWilliams spent much of his early career playing drums in [[punk rock]] bands during the late 1980s and early-to-mid-1990s. During this time frame, Williams was informed that he had fathered a son, [[Coleman Williams|Coleman Finchum]], who was five years old by that time; a family court judge ordered Williams to find more stable employment so that Finchum could receive [[child support]].\n\nWilliams later played bass guitar in  the [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band Superjoint Ritual, now renamed as [[Superjoint]] for legal reasons, led by [[Pantera]] vocalist [[Phil Anselmo]]. Williams also played drums for [[Arson Anthem]], formed with Anselmo and [[Mike Williams (singer)|Mike Williams]] of the [[sludge metal]] band [[Eyehategod]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=18998 |title=Metal News – Superjoint Ritual Is No More |publisher=Metalunderground.com |access-date=2011-09-14}}</ref>\n\n=== Recordings for Curb Records (1996–2010) ===\nCapitalizing on his family name and resemblance to his grandfather, he signed a contract with [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] music industry giant [[Curb Records]]. ''[[Three Hanks: Men with Broken Hearts]]'' was issued shortly thereafter, which spliced together recordings to make it seem that three generations of Williams men were singing alongside one another. In the late 1980s, upon first meeting Hank Williams III, [[Minnie Pearl]], a friend of the late Hank Williams Sr., reportedly said \"Lord, honey, you're a ghost\", as she was astonished by his striking resemblance to his grandfather.<ref>{{cite web|last=Harris |first=Will |url=http://www.bullz-eye.com/music/interviews/2008/hank_williams_iii.htm |title=A chat with Hank Williams III, Hank Williams III interview, Damn Right Rebel Proud, Tyler Torreance was his manager  |publisher=Bullz-eye.com |access-date=2011-09-14}}</ref>\n\nThe success of the \"Three Hanks\" album garnered Hank Jr. and Hank III a Vocal Duo of the Year nomination by the [[Academy of Country Music]] in 1997.<ref name=\"Past winners and nominees\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.acmcountry.com/winners |title=Winners database |work=ACM Country |access-date=December 18, 2022}}</ref>\n\nWilliams' first solo album, ''[[Risin' Outlaw]]'', was released in September 1999 to respectable sales and strong reviews, despite Williams's own hatred of the record.<ref>{{cite web| first=Tom | last=Netherland | url=http://www.rockabilly.net/articles/hank3c.shtml | title=Hank Williams III: Like grandfather, like grandson| publisher=Rockabilly.net | date=1999-09-07 | accessdate=2012-04-20}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003, Williams recorded ''This Ain't Country'' for Curb, who chose not to release it. On May 17, 2011, Curb released the album under the title ''[[Hillbilly Joker]]'', without the consent or input from Williams after his contract with the label had been terminated.\n\nIn 2006, after resolving a contractual dispute with [[Curb Records]], Williams released ''[[Straight to Hell (album)|Straight to Hell]]'' on Curb's rock imprint, Bruc. Battles with [[Walmart]] delayed the appearance of this album, which was released on February 28, 2006, as a two-disc set in two formats: a censored version (for Wal-Mart), and an uncensored version that was the first major-label country album ever to bear a [[parental advisory]] warning. ''Straight to Hell'' was also the first release through Curb's [[Bruc Records]] imprint. However, the uncensored version was released through Bruc, and the clean version was released through Curb. One of the songs, \"Pills I Took\", was written by a little-known Wisconsin group called [[Those Poor Bastards]], who originally released the song on their 2004 CD ''Country Bullshit''.\n\nWilliams released [[Assjack]]'s [[Assjack (album)|self-titled debut album]] on August 4, 2009, through Curb.\n\nHis next album, ''[[Rebel Within]]'', was released in May 2010, and was his last album with Curb Records.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hank3.com/media.htm |title= Hank III & Assjack ::: The Official Website|website=www.hank3.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205172409/http://www.hank3.com/media.htm |archive-date=December 5, 2008}}</ref> It charted at number 20 in ''Billboard'' magazine.\n\nBetween 2012 and 2017, Curb would release a series of unauthorized compilations of Williams' music. In 2012, Curb released a Williams album titled ''[[Long Gone Daddy]]'', marking the second album the company has released under his name since his departure. In 2014, Curb Records released a new album under Hank Williams III's name titled ''Ramblin' Man''. The album contains previously unreleased material that Williams recorded while on their label. The following year, Curb released another Williams album of previously unreleased songs titled ''Take as Needed for Pain''. The album is mostly a rock album but the single released was a country song titled \"Ruby Get Back to the Hills\". In 2017, Curb released a ''Greatest Hits'' album featuring select tracks from Williams' first four albums, mostly from ''Straight to Hell''.\n\n===Independent releases (2011–2014)===\n[[File:Hank Williams III 2010 2b.jpg|thumb|right|Williams in 2010]]\nWilliams released four new CDs in September 2011. ''[[Ghost to a Ghost/Gutter Town]]'' (a 2-disc country record with some ambient and folk influences), ''3 Bar Ranch Cattle Callin''' (a metal record in the newly anointed cattle core genre) and ''[[Attention Deficit Domination]]'' (a doom-rock record), were released under his label Hank3 Records through [[Megaforce Records]], and featured guest appearances by [[Tom Waits]], [[Les Claypool]] ([[Primus (band)|Primus]]), Alan King (Hellstomper), Ray Lawrence Jr., Troy Medlin (Sourvein), Dave Sherman (Earthride) and Williams' dog, Trooper.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/hank3 |title=Hank 3 |publisher=Facebook |access-date=2011-09-14}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, Williams two new albums: a country album ''[[Brothers of the 4×4]]'' and punk album ''A Fiendish Threat'', under the band name \"3\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hank3.com/news.html |title=Hank3 ::: The Official Website |access-date=2013-08-10 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131009054457/http://hank3.com/news.html |archive-date=October 9, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, Williams was featured on [[DevilDriver]]'s cover of his song \"Country Heroes\", which appears on their album ''[[Outlaws 'til the End: Vol. 1]]''.

McElfresh's predecessor was fellow-fiddle-player Michael \"Fiddleboy\" McCanless, who would play all three sets, adding traditional violin for the country set of the concert before turning on different effect pedals for later sets. Another former band member was guitarist [[Duane Denison]], previously with [[The Jesus Lizard]], who left The Damn Band and Assjack in January 2001 and later that year formed [[Tomahawk (band)|Tomahawk]].\n\n==Discography==\n{{main|Hank Williams III discography}}\n;Studio albums\n* ''[[Risin' Outlaw]]'' (1999)\n* ''[[Lovesick, Broke and Driftin']]'' (2002)\n* ''[[Straight to Hell (album)|Straight to Hell]]'' (2006)\n* ''[[Damn Right, Rebel Proud]]'' (2008)\n* ''[[Rebel Within]]'' (2010)\n* ''[[Hillbilly Joker]]'' (2011)\n* ''[[Ghost to a Ghost/Gutter Town]]'' (Hank3 Records, 2011)\n* ''[[3 Bar Ranch Cattle Callin']]'' (Hank3 Records, 2011)\n* ''[[Attention Deficit Domination]]'' (Hank3 Records, 2011)\n* ''[[Brothers of the 4×4]]'' (Hank3 Records, 2013)\n* ''A Fiendish Threat'' (Hank3 Records, 2013)\n<!--The unendorsed releases by Curb Records of \"Long Gone Daddy\", \"Ramblin Man\" and \"Take as Needed For Pain\" do NOT contain new material and are NOT true studio albums.
