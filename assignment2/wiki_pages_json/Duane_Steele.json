The following year, he released his debut solo album, ''[[P.O. Box 423]]''.

He was nominated for the Vista Rising Star Award by the [[Canadian Country Music Association]] (CCMA) in 1996, but lost to [[Terri Clark]]. He also received a nomination for Male Vocalist of the Year. In 1997, the [[Juno Award]]s nominated Steele for Best Country Male Vocalist, and also the all-genre Best New Solo Artist. He won his first award, Vocal Event of the Year, at the 1997 CCMA Awards for his duet with [[Lisa Brokop]], \"Two Names On An Overpass.\"\n\nSteele's second album, ''[[This Is the Life (Duane Steele album)|This Is the Life]]'', was released in September 1997. The disc included a cover of [[Gordon Lightfoot]]'s \"[[If You Could Read My Mind (song)|If You Could Read My Mind]].\" The first two singles, \"Tell The Girl\" and \"If I Could Just Get To You,\" both reached the Canadian top 10. Steele was again nominated for Male Vocalist of the Year in 1998 at both the CCMA Awards and the Juno Awards. When subsequent singles failed to reach the top 30, Steele and Mercury parted ways.<ref>{{usurped|1=[https://archive.today/20120711074656/http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Artists/S/Steele_Duane/1998/10/06/749944.html CANOE – JAM!
