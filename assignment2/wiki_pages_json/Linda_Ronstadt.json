It was her first foray into [[traditional jazz]] since her sessions with Jerry Wexler and her records with the Nelson Riddle Orchestra, but this time with an intimate [[jazz]] [[musical ensemble|combo]]. The album was a quiet affair for Ronstadt, giving few interviews and making only one television performance as a promotion. It reached number 2 on Billboard's Top Jazz Albums chart but peaked at number 166 on the main Billboard album chart. Not having the mass distribution that [[Warner Music Group]] gave her, ''Hummin' To Myself'' had sold over 75,000 copies in the U.S. as of 2010.

Unfortunately, the attempt did not pan out. Ronstadt later remarked that not too many people were in control at the time and everyone was too involved with their own careers. (Though the efforts to complete the album were abandoned, a number of the recordings were included on the singers' respective solo recordings over the next few years.) This concept album was put on the back burner for almost ten years.\n\nIn January 1986, the three eventually did make their way into the recording studio, where they spent the next several months working. The result, ''[[Trio (1987 album)|Trio]]'', which they had conceived ten years earlier, was released in March 1987. It was a considerable hit, holding the number 1 position on Billboard's Country Albums chart for five weeks running and hitting the Top 10 on the pop side also. Selling over three million copies in the U.S. and winning them a [[Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]], it produced four Top Ten Country singles including \"[[To Know Him Is to Love Him]]\" which hit number 1. The album was also a nominee for overall Album of the Year, in the company of Michael Jackson, [[U2]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], and [[Whitney Houston]].\n\nIn 1994, the three performers recorded a follow-up to ''Trio''. As was the case with their aborted 1978 effort, conflicting schedules and competing priorities delayed the album's release indefinitely. Ronstadt, who had already paid for studio time{{nsmdns}}and owed her record company a finished album{{nsmdns}}removed Parton's individual tracks at Parton's request, kept Harris's vocals, and produced a number of the recordings, which she subsequently released on her 1995 return to country rock, the album ''[[Feels Like Home (Linda Ronstadt album)|Feels Like Home]]''.\n\nHowever, in 1999, Ronstadt, Parton, and Harris agreed to release the ''[[Trio II]]'' album, as was originally recorded in 1994. It included an ethereal cover of Neil Young's \"[[After The Gold Rush (song)|After The Gold Rush]]\" which became a popular music video. The effort was certified Gold (over 500,000 copies sold) and won them a [[Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals]] for the track. Ronstadt co-produced the album with [[George Massenburg]] and the three women also received a nomination for the [[Grammy Award for Best Country Album]].\n\n===''Canciones de Mi Padre''===\n\n{{main article|Canciones de Mi Padre}}\n\nAt the end of 1987, Ronstadt released ''Canciones de Mi Padre'', an album of traditional Mexican folk songs, or what she has described as \"world class songs\". Keeping with the Ronstadt history theme, her cover art was dramatic, bold, and colorful; it shows Ronstadt in full Mexican regalia. Her musical arranger was mariachi musician [[Rubén Fuentes]].\n\nThese ''[[canciones]]'' were a big part of Ronstadt's family tradition and musical roots. In January 1946, the [[University of Arizona]] published a booklet by [[Luisa Espinel]] entitled ''Canciones de mi Padre''.<ref name=\"MyFathersSongs\">{{Cite web |last=Griffith |first=James S. |title=The Singing Ronstadts and Canciones de mi Padre – A Musical Family |url=http://parentseyes.arizona.edu/ronstadtfamily/music/cancintr.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070615124049/http://parentseyes.arizona.edu/ronstadtfamily/music/cancintr.html |archive-date=June 15, 2007 |access-date=May 30, 2007 |website=Tucson'sRonstadtFamily}}</ref> Luisa Espinel, Ronstadt's aunt, was an international singer in the 1920s and 1930s. Espinel's father was Fred Ronstadt, Linda Ronstadt's grandfather, and the songs she had learned, transcribed, and published were some of the ones he had brought with him from [[Sonora]]. Ronstadt researched and extracted from the favorites she had learned from her father Gilbert and she called her album by the same name as her aunt's booklet and as a tribute to her father and his family. Though not fully bilingual, she has a fairly good command of the Spanish language, allowing her to sing Latin American songs with little discernible U.S. accent; Ronstadt has often identified herself as Mexican-American.<ref name=\"MexAm\">{{Cite web |title=American Way |url=http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/artamway.htm |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808111245/http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/artamway.htm |archive-date=August 8, 2007 |access-date=May 7, 2007 |website=Linda Ronstadt's New Old Flame- Mexican Music}}</ref> Her formative years were spent with her father's side of the family.<ref name=\"rollingstone\">{{Cite magazine |last=Herbst |first=Peter |title=The Rolling Stone Interview |url=http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/intrs78.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061022112308/http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/intrs78.htm |archive-date=October 22, 2006 |access-date=October 19, 2006 |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]}}</ref> In fact, in 1976, Ronstadt had collaborated with her father to write and compose a traditional Mexican folk ballad, ''\"Lo siento mi vida\"''{{snds}}a song that she included on ''Hasten Down the Wind''. Ronstadt has also credited Mexican singer [[Lola Beltrán]] as an influence on her own singing style, and she recalls how a frequent guest to the Ronstadt home, [[Lalo Guerrero|Eduardo \"Lalo\" Guerrero]], father of [[Chicano]] music, would often serenade her as a child.<ref name=\"AARP-07\" />\n\n''Canciones de Mi Padre'' won Ronstadt a Grammy Award for [[Grammy Award for Best Mexican/Mexican-American Album|Best Mexican-American Performance]]. In 2001, it was certified double-platinum by the RIAA for shipments of over 2&nbsp;million copies in the United States, making it the best-selling non-English-language album in U.S. music history. The album and later theatrical stage show served as a benchmark of the Latin cultural renaissance in North America.\n\n{{quote box\n| width=25%\n| align=left\n| quote=(I obtained) enough clout and ... after years and years of making commercial records, I was entitled to experiment ... the success of the (Nelson Riddle albums) ... entitled me to try the Mexican stuff.\n|source=—Linda Ronstadt<ref name=\"Windy\" />}}\n\nRonstadt produced and performed a theatrical stage show, also titled ''Canciones de mi Padre'', in concert halls across the U.S. and Latin America to both Hispanic and non-Hispanic audiences. These performances were later released on DVD. Ronstadt elected to return to the Broadway stage, four years after she performed in ''La bohème'', for a limited-run engagement. [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS's]] ''Great Performances'' aired the stage show during its annual fund drives and the show was a hit with audiences, earning Ronstadt a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program]].\n\nRonstadt recorded two additional albums of Latin music in the early 1990s. Their promotion, like most of her albums in the 1990s, was a quieter affair, with Ronstadt making only a limited number of appearances to promote them. They were not nearly as successful as ''Canciones De Mi Padre'', but were critically acclaimed in some circles. In 1991, she released ''[[Mas Canciones]]'', a follow-up to the first ''Canciones''. For this album, she won a Grammy Award for [[Grammy Award for Best Mexican/Mexican-American Album|Best Mexican/Mexican-American Album]]. The following year, she stepped outside of the mariachi genre and decided to record well-known Afro-Cuban songs. This album was titled ''[[Frenesí (album)|Frenesí]]''. Like her two previous Latin recordings ventures, it won Ronstadt a Grammy Award, this time for [[Grammy Award for Best Traditional Tropical Latin Album|Best Traditional Tropical Latin Album]].\n\nIn 1991, Ronstadt acted in the lead role of archangel San Miguel in ''La Pastorela'', or ''A Shephard's Tale'', a musical filmed at ''[[San Juan Bautista, California|San Juan Bautista]]''. It was written and directed by [[Luis Valdez]]. The production was part of the PBS ''Great Performances'' series.\n\nIn December 2020, it was announced that ''Canciones de Mi Padre'' had been inducted into the [[Grammy Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web |title=GRAMMY Hall Of Fame Welcomes 2021 Inductions: A Tribe Called Quest, Billie Holiday, Journey, Patti Smith, Bruce Springsteen And More |date=December 21, 2020 |url=https://www.grammy.com/press-releases/grammy-hall-fame-2021-inductions-welcomes-recordings-tribe-called-quest-billie-holiday-journey-linda |publisher=Recording Academy |access-date=February 16, 2021 |archive-date=March 1, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210301191303/https://www.grammy.com/press-releases/grammy-hall-fame-2021-inductions-welcomes-recordings-tribe-called-quest-billie-holiday-journey-linda |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Returning to the contemporary music scene===\nBy the late 1980s, while enjoying the success of her big band jazz collaborations with Riddle and her surprise hit mariachi recordings, Ronstadt elected to return to recording mainstream pop music once again. In 1987, she made a return to the top of the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 singles chart with \"[[Somewhere Out There (James Horner song)|Somewhere Out There]]\", which peaked at number 2 in March.<ref name=bronson /> Featured in the animated film ''[[An American Tail]]'', the sentimental duet with James Ingram was nominated for several Grammy Awards, ultimately winning the [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year]]. The song also received a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] and achieved high sales, earning a million-selling gold single in the U.S.{{snds}}one of the last 45s ever to do so. It was also accompanied by a popular music video. On the heels of this success, [[Steven Spielberg]] asked Ronstadt to record the theme song for the animated sequel titled ''[[An American Tail: Fievel Goes West]]'', which was titled \"[[Dreams to Dream]]\". Although \"Dreams to Dream\" failed to achieve the success of \"Somewhere Out There\", the song did give Ronstadt an Adult Contemporary hit in 1991.\n\nIn 1989, Ronstadt released a mainstream pop album and several popular singles. ''[[Cry Like A Rainstorm, Howl Like The Wind]]'' became one of the singer's most successful albums{{snds}}in production, arrangements, sales, and critical acclaim. It became Ronstadt's tenth Top 10 album on the ''Billboard'' chart, reaching number 7 and being certified triple-platinum<ref name=RIAAsearch /> (over three million copies sold in the U.S.).

It included the duets with Aaron Neville, \"[[Don't Know Much]]\" (''Billboard'' Hot 100 number 2 hit, Christmas 1989<ref name=bronson />) and \"[[All My Life (Linda Ronstadt song)|All My Life]]\" (''Billboard'' Hot 100 number 11 hit), both of which were long-running number 1 Adult Contemporary hits. The duets earned several Grammy Award nominations. The duo won both the 1989 and 1990 Best Pop Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal awards. Ronstadt's last known live Grammy Award appearance was in 1990 when she and Neville performed \"Don't Know Much\" together on the telecast.<ref name=kqed /> (\"Whenever I sing with a different artist, I can get things out of my voice that I can't do by myself\", Ronstadt reflected in 2007. \"I can do things with Aaron that I can't do alone.\")<ref>Thibodeaux, Ron (February 11, 2007). \"Home Grown\".

It included New Age arrangements such as the lead single \"[[Heartbeats Accelerating]]\" as well as the self-penned title track and featured the glass harmonica. It was her first commercial failure since 1972, and peaked at number 92 in Billboard, whereas 1995's ''[[Feels Like Home (Linda Ronstadt album)|Feels Like Home]]'' was Ronstadt's much-heralded return to country-rock and included her version of [[Tom Petty]]'s classic hit \"[[The Waiting (song)|The Waiting]]\". The single's rollicking, fiddle-infused flip side, \"Walk On\", returned Ronstadt to the Country Singles chart for the first time since 1983. An album track entitled \"The Blue Train\" charted 10 weeks in ''Billboard''{{'}}s Adult Contemporary Top 40. This album fared slightly better than its predecessor, reaching number 75. Both albums were later deleted from the Elektra/Asylum catalog. Ronstadt was nominated for three [[Premio Lo Nuestro 1993|Lo Nuestro Awards]] in 1993: Female Regional Mexican Artist of the Year, Female Tropical/Salsa Artist of the Year, and her version of the song \"Perfidia\" was also listed for Tropical/Salsa Song of the Year.<ref name=\"billboardmag\">{{Cite magazine |last=Lannert |first=John |date=March 30, 1993 |title=Secada Lead Latin Noms Following Grammy Win |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0w8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA10 |url-status=live |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=105 |issue=10 |page=10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160103033249/https://books.google.com/books?id=0w8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA10&dq=no+se+tu+luis+miguel&hl=es-419&sa=X&ei=_PzlUJ3QOcKsjALfhYEQ&ved=0CFAQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=no%20se%20tu%20luis%20miguel&f=false |archive-date=January 3, 2016 |access-date=January 3, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1996, Ronstadt produced ''[[Dedicated to the One I Love (album)|Dedicated to the One I Love]]'', an album of classic rock and roll songs reinvented as lullabies. The album reached number 78 in ''Billboard'' and won the [[Grammy Award for Best Musical Album for Children]].\n\nIn 1998, Ronstadt released ''[[We Ran]]'', her first album in over two years. The album harkened back to Ronstadt's country-rock and folk-rock heyday. She returned to her rock 'n' roll roots with vivid interpretations of songs by [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Doc Pomus]], [[Bob Dylan]], and [[John Hiatt]]. The recording was produced by [[Glyn Johns]]. A commercial failure, the album stood at 57,897 copies sold at the time of its deletion in 2008. It is the poorest-selling studio album in Ronstadt's Elektra/Asylum catalog. ''We Ran'' did not chart any singles but it was well received by critics.\n\nDespite the lack of success of ''We Ran'', Ronstadt kept moving towards this adult rock exploration. In the summer of 1999, she released the album ''[[Western Wall: The Tucson Sessions]]'', a folk-rock-oriented project with Emmylou Harris. It earned a nomination for the Grammy Award for the Best Contemporary Folk Album and made the Top 10 of ''Billboard''{{'}}s Country Albums chart. Still in print as of December 2016, it has sold 223,255 copies per [[Nielsen SoundScan]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nAlso in 1999, Ronstadt went back to her concert roots when she performed with the Eagles and Jackson Browne at [[Staples Center]]'s 1999 New Year's Eve celebration kicking off the December 31 end-of-the-millennium festivities. As Staples Center Senior Vice President and general manager Bobby Goldwater said, \"It was our goal to present a spectacular event as a sendoff to the 20th century\", and \"Eagles, Jackson Browne, and Linda Ronstadt are three of the most popular acts of the century.

The fulfillment of this contract commenced with the release of ''[[A Merry Little Christmas (Linda Ronstadt album)|A Merry Little Christmas]]'', her first holiday collection, which includes rare choral works, the somber Joni Mitchell song \"[[River (Joni Mitchell song)|River]]\", and a rare recorded duet with the late [[Rosemary Clooney]] on Clooney's signature song, \"[[White Christmas (song)|White Christmas]]\".\n\nSince leaving Warner Music, Ronstadt has gone on to release one album each under [[Verve Records|Verve]] and [[Vanguard Records]].\n\n{{quote box\n| width=25%\n| align=left\n| quote=Your musical soul is like facets of a jewel, and you stick out one facet at a time ...

It was an album of roots music incorporating pop, Cajun, and early-20th-century music and released on the Vanguard Records label. But ''Adieu False Heart'' was a commercial failure, peaking at number 146 in the U.S. despite her touring for the final time that year. It was the last time Linda Ronstadt would record an album, having begun to lose her singing ability as a result of a degenerative condition later determined to be progressive supranuclear palsy, but initially diagnosed as Parkinson's disease, in December 2012. ''Adieu False Heart'', recorded in [[Louisiana]], features a cast of local musicians, including Chas Justus, Eric Frey and Kevin Wimmer of [[the Red Stick Ramblers]], Sam Broussard of [[the Mamou Playboys]], [[Dirk Powell]], and [[Joel Savoy]], as well as an array of Nashville musicians: fiddler [[Stuart Duncan]], mandolinist [[Sam Bush]], and guitarist [[Bryan Sutton]]. The recording earned two Grammy Award nominations: [[Grammy Award for Best Traditional Folk Album|Best Traditional Folk Album]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical|Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical]].\n\nIn 2007, Ronstadt contributed to the compilation album ''[[We All Love Ella: Celebrating the First Lady of Song]]''{{snds}}a tribute album to jazz music's all-time most heralded artist{{snds}}on the track \"[[Miss Otis Regrets]]\".<ref>[http://www.rockonthenet.com/artists-r/lindaronstadt.htm Linda Ronstadt] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161024115915/http://www.rockonthenet.com/artists-r/lindaronstadt.htm |date=October 24, 2016}} Rock on the Net.</ref>\n\nIn August 2007, Ronstadt headlined the [[Newport Folk Festival]], making her debut at this event, where she incorporated jazz, rock, and folk music into her repertoire.
