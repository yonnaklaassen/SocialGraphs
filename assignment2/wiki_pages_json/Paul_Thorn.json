He asked Thorn if he had his permission to share his name with other record companies in Nashville. A couple weeks later, Thorn called vOz Vanelli (owner of Vanelli's) and mentioned that several record companies were coming to Tupelo to hear him perform. Thorn asked if he could come and play at Vanelli's which vOz agreed to. After hearing Thorn perform, Wyatt Easterling (an associate of [[Miles Copeland III]]) brought Thorn to Nashville and within thirty days, Thorn opened for [[Sting (musician)|Sting]]. Thorn was subsequently signed to a recording contract with [[A&M Records]] and recorded his first album, ''Hammer & Nail,'' in 1997. He left A&M soon after and followed ''Hammer & Nail'' with thirteen more albums, all self-released and self-produced with his writing and production partner, Billy Maddox.\n\nThorn's 2010 album ''Pimps and Preachers'' debuted at No.&nbsp;83 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] [[record chart|chart]], his highest chart position to date.
