The doctor feared he wouldn't survive to adulthood. His parents divorced when he was nine years old. He then moved with his father to [[Memphis, Tennessee]], and was placed in an [[orphanage]]. After running away twice, he then was sent to live with his grandparents, in [[Greenville, Mississippi]]. His uncle Otis Cochran taught him to play the guitar as the pair [[hitchhiking|hitchhiked]] from Mississippi to southeastern [[New Mexico]] to work in the [[oilfield]]s.<ref name=WatkinsB-CL-2003-08-06>Watkins, Billy. – \"Everybody wants to sing\". – ''[[The Clarion-Ledger]]''. – August 6, 2003.</ref> After returning to Mississippi as a teenager, Cochran went to California and picked olives. While there, he formed The Cochran Brothers, a duo with [[Eddie Cochran]].<ref name=WatkinsB-CL-2003-08-06 />\n\nIn 1960 at the age of 24, he hitchhiked for Hollywood, but ended up going to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], and teamed with [[Harlan Howard]] to write the song \"[[I Fall to Pieces]]\".<ref name=\"Larkin\" /> <ref name=\":0\" />It became a major success for [[Patsy Cline]] (recorded November 16, 1960), reaching No.&nbsp;1 on the [[Billboard charts|Billboard country music charts]] and No.&nbsp;12 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] (chart for all music categories).

He left the theater quickly, and by the time he got home fifteen minutes later, composed \"[[Make the World Go Away]].\" [[Ray Price (musician)|Ray Price]] recorded the song, and it scored No.&nbsp;2 on the Billboard country charts in 1963. The next year [[Eddy Arnold]], who recorded it in as a pop-oriented Nashville Sound arrangement, made the song his signature hit and one of the biggest sellers in country music history, scoring No.&nbsp;1 on the country music charts, then in 1965 No.&nbsp;6 on the overall Billboard Hot 100 charts (his highest rated song ever).<ref name=WatkinsB-CL-2003-08-06 /> <ref name=\":0\" />Arnold also recorded the song \"[[I Want to Go with You]]\".<ref name=\"Larkin\" /> \n\nCochran wrote several successful songs sung by [[Burl Ives]] (\"[[A Little Bitty Tear]]\", \"[[Funny Way of Laughin']]\", \"The Same Old Hurt\").

While there, he noticed an amazing new talent. He encouraged management to contract the young songwriter, [[Willie Nelson]], giving Nelson a raise owed to him at the time.<ref name=WatkinsB-CL-2003-08-06 />\n\nTwo of his fondest memories were working with [[Natalie Cole]] (among other artists) on a 2003 tribute album to Patsy Cline (''[[Remembering Patsy Cline]]''), because of his love for her father [[Nat King Cole]],<ref name=WatkinsB-CL-2003-08-06 /> and his collaboration with [[Vern Gosdin]] for the 1988 album ''[[Chiseled in Stone (album)|Chiseled in Stone]]'' (Gosdin's highest rated album at No.&nbsp;7).<ref>Cooper, Peter. – \"The man, the mystery and the mega-hits\". – ''[[The Tennessean]]''. – March 23, 2007.</ref>\n\nIn 2008, singer Lea Anne Creswell came to Cochran's home to choose songs for a new album, subsequently called ''Lea Anne Sings Hank Cochran and ...''.<ref>Moon, Troy. – \"Songwriter lends talent to CD, but will Willie be at release party?\". – ''[[Pensacola News Journal]]''. – May 18, 2001.</ref>\n\n== Marriages ==\nCochran was married five times.
