Primarily known for [[Pop music|pop]] and [[Country music|country]] music, she was the top-charting female vocalist and best-selling female artist of the 1950s,<ref name=allmusic/> selling over 100 million records during a six-decade-long career.<ref>{{cite news |work=South Coast Today |title=Patti Page was a 'Singing Rage' in a phenomenal six-decade career |url=http://archive.southcoasttoday.com/daily/02-99/02-17-99/b01ae041.htm |date=February 17, 1999 |access-date=July 23, 2008}}</ref> She was often introduced as \"the Singin' Rage, Miss Patti Page\". New York [[WBBR|WNEW]] disc-jockey [[William B. Williams (DJ)|William B. Williams]] introduced her as \"A Page in my life called Patti\".\n\nPage signed with [[Mercury Records]] in 1947, and became their first successful female artist, starting with 1948's \"[[Confess (song)|Confess]]\". In 1950, she had her first million-selling single \"[[With My Eyes Wide Open, I'm Dreaming]]\", and eventually had 14 additional million-selling singles between 1950 and 1965.\n\nPage's signature song, \"[[Tennessee Waltz]]\", was one of the biggest-selling singles of the 20th century, and is recognized today as one of the official songs of the state of Tennessee. It spent 13 weeks atop the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s best-sellers list in 1950/51. Page had three additional number-one hit singles between 1950 and 1953, \"[[All My Love (Bolero)]]\", \"[[I Went to Your Wedding]]\", and \"[[(How Much Is) That Doggie in the Window?]]\".\n\nUnlike most other pop singers, Page blended [[country music]] styles into many of her songs. As a result of this crossover appeal, many of Page's singles appeared on the [[Hot Country Songs|''Billboard'' Country Chart]]. In the 1970s, she shifted her style more toward country music and began having even more success on the country charts, ending up as one of the few vocalists to have charted in five separate decades.\n\nWith the rise of [[rock and roll]] in the 1950s, mainstream popular music record sales began to decline. Page was among the few pop singers who were able to maintain popularity, continuing to have hits well into the 1960s, with \"[[Old Cape Cod]]\", \"[[Allegheny Moon]]\", \"[[A Poor Man's Roses (or a Rich Man's Gold)]]\", and \"[[Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte (song)|Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte]]\".\n\nIn 1997, Patti Page was inducted into the [[Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame]]. She was posthumously honored with the [[Lifetime Achievement Grammy]] Award in 2013.\n\n==Early life==\nClara Ann Fowler was born on November 8, 1927, in Claremore, Oklahoma (some sources give Muskogee, Oklahoma)<ref name=allmusic>{{cite web |last=Bush |first=John |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p3137/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Patti Page biography |work=Allmusic |access-date=July 23, 2008}}</ref> into a large and poor family of 11 children (3 boys and 8 girls).<ref name=corporate/><ref name=1930USCensus>1930 US Census.

In 1946, Jack Rael, a saxophone player and manager of the Jimmy Joy Band, came to Tulsa for a one-night stand. Rael heard Page on the radio, liked her voice, and asked her to join the band.

The arrangement of \"Confess\" was meant to use a backing chorus, but Mercury would not pay for one since Page had not yet produced a charting single, so if she wanted additional singers she would have to hire them at her own expense. Instead, her manager Jack Rael decided to try an experiment. [[Bill Putnam]], an engineer for Mercury Records, was able to overdub Page's voice by syncing the two master discs together—tape recording was not in use yet and this technique was difficult to pull off.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.oregonlive.com/celebrity-news/2013/01/singer_patti_page_dies_at_85.html | title=Singer Patti Page dies at 85 | date=January 3, 2013 }}</ref><ref name=contemporary>{{cite web |url=http://www.enotes.com/contemporary-musicians/page-patti-biography |title=Contemporary musicians – Patti Page biography| work=Contemporary Musicians |publisher=End Notes.com |access-date=July 23, 2008}}</ref> Thus, Page became the first pop artist to harmonize her own vocals on a recording. This gimmick got \"Confess\" to #12 on the ''Billboard''.<ref name=allmusic/> This technique later was used on Page's biggest hit singles in the 1950s. Page had four more singles chart in 1948–49, with two (\"So In Love\" and \"With My Eyes Wide Open, I'm Dreaming\" reaching the top 15. Page also had a top 15 hit on the ''Billboard'' country chart in 1949 with \"[[Money, Marbles, and Chalk]]\". After the experiment of \"Confess\" worked, Page and Rael got more ambitious and began trying four part overdubs.\n\nIn 1950, Page had her first million-selling single \"[[With My Eyes Wide Open, I'm Dreaming]]\",<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\">{{cite book\n| first= Joseph\n| last= Murrells\n| year= 1978\n| title= The Book of Golden Discs\n| edition= 2nd\n| publisher= Barrie and Jenkins Ltd\n| location= London\n| page= [https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/48 48]\n| isbn= 0-214-20512-6\n| url-access= registration\n| url= https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/48\n}}</ref> another song where she harmonized her vocals. Because she was overdubbing her vocals, Page's name had to be listed on the recording credits as a group. According to one early 1950s chart, Page was credited as the Patti Page Quartet. In mid-1950, Page's single \"[[All My Love (Bolero)]]\" became her first #1 on the Billboard<ref name=allmusic/> spending five weeks there. That same year, she also had her first top-10 hit with \"[[I Don't Care if the Sun Don't Shine]]\", as well as the top-25 single \"[[Back in Your Own Backyard]]\". With this success, Page earned the privilege of releasing her first LP, the self-titled \"Patti Page\" which opened with \"Confess\" and included other of her singles from this period. She also released a Christmas album in 1951; this was reissued five years later with updated cover art on a 12\" LP with a few new tracks to fill the run time out.\n\n===\"Tennessee Waltz\": 1950===\nThe success of \"Bolero\" however was quickly eclipsed by what soon became Page's signature song. \"Tennessee Waltz\" was written in 1946 by Pee Wee King and Redd Stewart, and was recorded in 1947 by [[Pee Wee King]] and His Golden West Cowboys. Their original version made the country charts in 1948. The song was also a hit for [[Cowboy Copas]] around the same time. Page was introduced to the song by record producer [[Jerry Wexler]], who suggested that she cover a recent R&B version by the [[Erskine Hawkins]] Orchestra. Page liked the song, and she recorded and released it as a single.\n\n\"Tennessee Waltz\" became a blockbuster hit by complete accident—it was the B-side to \"Boogie Woogie Santa Claus\" which Mercury had intended to promote during the 1950 holiday season. The label intentionally put \"Tennessee Waltz\" on the disc to avoid drawing attention away from a planned Christmas hit, as they considered the song a throwaway with no hitmaking potential. To everyone's complete surprise, it went on to spend nine weeks at #1 during December 1950-January 1951, while \"Boogie Woogie Santa Claus\" failed to chart at all and was quickly forgotten. \"Tennessee Waltz\" also became Page's second single to appear on the country charts, becoming her biggest hit there, reaching number two. The song later became one of the best-selling records of its era, selling 7 million copies in the early 1950s. \"Tennessee Waltz\" remains the biggest commercial success for the overdubbing technique, pioneered by producer [[Mitch Miller]], which enabled Page to harmonize with herself.<ref name=contemporary/> \"Tennessee Waltz\" was the last song to sell one million copies of sheet music. The song was covered by several other singers during the next few months including [[Jo Stafford]] and [[Les Paul and Mary Ford]].\n\nThe song was featured in the 1970 film ''[[Zabriskie Point (film)|Zabriskie Point]]'' and in the 1983 film ''[[The Right Stuff (film)|The Right Stuff]]''.<ref name=Patti>{{cite web |url=http://home.earthlink.net/~jaymar41/patti.html |title=Patti Page – The Singing Rage |publisher=Earthlink.com |access-date=July 23, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016081908/http://home.earthlink.net/~jaymar41/patti.html |archive-date=October 16, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Breakthrough: 1951–1965===\n[[File:Frankie Laine Patti Page 1950s.jpg|thumb|Page with [[Frankie Laine]], c. 1950s]]\nIn 1951, Page covered \"[[Would I Love You (Love You, Love You)]]\", which had been a hit for [[Doris Day]]. Page's version was a top-five hit that sold 1 million copies. The next single, \"[[Mockin' Bird Hill]]\", (a cover of the original by [[Les Paul]] and [[Mary Ford]]) was her fourth million seller. Page had three more top 10 hits on ''Billboard'' in 1951, starting with \"[[Mister and Mississippi]]\", which peaked at number eight; \"[[And So to Sleep Again]]\"; and \"[[Detour (song)|Detour]]\", which had been recorded and made famous by [[Spade Cooley]], [[Foy Willing]], and [[Elton Britt]]. Page's version was the most popular and became her seventh million-selling single.<ref name=Patti/> She also released her first studio album in 1951 titled ''[[Folk Song Favorites]]''.\n\nIn 1952, Page had a third number-one hit with \"[[I Went to Your Wedding]]\", which spent two months at number one. Recorded in a country ballad style, the song was the B-side of \"[[You Belong to Me (1952 song)|You Belong to Me]]\", also a top-10 hit. \"I Went to Your Wedding\" was Page's eighth million-selling single in the United States. It displaced [[Jo Stafford]]'s version of \"You Belong to Me\" at number one on ''Billboard's'' Best Seller chart.<ref name=allmusic/> She had continued success that year, with three more songs in the top 10, \"[[Come What May (1952 song)|Come What May]]\", \"[[Once in a While (1937 song)|Once in a While]]\", and \"[[Why Don't You Believe Me]]\".\n\nIn 1953, the novelty tune \"(How Much Is That) Doggie in the Window?\" became Page's fourth number-one hit, selling over 1 million copies and staying on the chart for five months. The song included the sound of a dog barking, which made it popular with a younger audience. It became one of her best-loved songs, but in later years would often be lampooned by rock critics and used to ridicule the state of popular music in the 1950s just prior to rock-and-roll.<ref name=Patti/> The song was written by novelty-tune specialist [[Bob Merrill]]. It was recorded by Page for the children's album ''Arfie Goes to School''. It was also a UK hit and British singer [[Lita Roza]] performed a cover version that made the top 10 there.<ref name=oldies>[http://www.oldies.com/artist-biography/Patti-Page.html Biography – Patti Page] ''oldies.com;'' retrieved 7-23-08.</ref> She had a series of top-20 hits that year. \"[[Changing Partners]]\", a final single, reached the top five, peaking at number three, and staying on the charts for five months. The song was also a country melody, like many of Page's hits at the time.<ref name=Patti/>\n\nIn 1954, Page had more chart hits, including \"[[Cross Over the Bridge]]\", which again overdubbed Page's vocals and peaked at number two. Other top-10 hits by Page that year included \"[[Steam Heat]]\" (from the Broadway musical ''[[The Pajama Game]]'') and \"[[Let Me Go Lover]]\".<ref name=oldies/>\nIn 1955, Page had one chart single: \"Croce di Oro\".\n\nUnlike most other pop singers of her time, Page was able to maintain success into the rock-and-roll era. She had three hits in 1956, including the number-two \"[[Allegheny Moon]]\". In 1957, she had major hits with \"[[A Poor Man's Roses (or a Rich Man's Gold)]]\" (recorded the same year by [[Patsy Cline]]) and the top-five hit \"[[Old Cape Cod]]\".\n\n{{listen | filename = Old Cape Cod - Patti Page - sample.ogg | title = \"Old Cape Cod\" | description = \"[[Old Cape Cod]]\" (1957). Page overdubbed her own vocals, illustrated by the tight harmonies in this sample.}}\n\nIn 1956, [[Vic Schoen]] became Patti Page's musical director, producing her on a long string of hits that included \"[[Mama from the Train]]\", \"Allegheny Moon\", \"Old Cape Cod\", \"[[Belonging to Someone]]\", and \"[[Left Right Out of Your Heart]]\". Page and Schoen's most challenging project was a recording of [[Gordon Jenkins]] narrative-tone poem as ''[[Manhattan Tower (Gordon Jenkins album)|Manhattan Tower]]'' (recorded September 1956). The album was a success both artistically and commercially, reaching number 18 on the ''Billboard'' LP chart, the highest ranking of any of her albums. Schoen's arrangements were more lively and jazzy than the original Jenkins arrangements. Schoen recalled, \"Patti was an alto, but I pushed her to reach notes higher than she had sung before for this album. We always enjoyed working together.\" Page and Schoen continued their collaboration for many years, working together until 1999.\n\nDuring the 1950s, Page made regular TV appearances, including ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', ''[[Bob Hope television specials|The Bob Hope Specials]]'', ''[[The Steve Allen Show]]'', and ''[[The Dean Martin Show]]''. This eventually led to Page having television specials of her own. She later had her own series, beginning with ''Scott Music Hall'' in the 1952–53 season and a syndicated series for [[Oldsmobile]]<ref name=NNDB>[http://www.nndb.com/people/205/000045070/ Patti Page profile] ''NNDB.com;'' retrieved 7-23-08.</ref> in 1955, ''[[The Patti Page Show]]''. However, this show only lasted one season, as did ''[[The Big Record]]'' (1957–58) and ''The Patti Page Olds Show'', sponsored by Oldsmobile (1958–59). Page also began an acting career at this time, beginning with a role on ''[[Playhouse 90]]''. Page made her movie debut in 1960 in ''[[Elmer Gantry (film)|Elmer Gantry]]''.<ref name=NNDB/> She also recorded the theme song for ''[[Boys' Night Out (film)|Boys Night Out]]'', in which she played the part of Joanne McIllenny.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0656303/ Patti Page appearances] ''IMDb.com;'' retrieved 7-23-08.</ref> In 1959, Page recorded [[The Sound of Music (song)|the title song]] from the musical ''[[The Sound of Music]]'' for [[Mercury Records]]<ref>[http://www.discogs.com/Patti-Page-The-Sound-Of-Music-Little-Donkey/master/644503 \"Patti Page – 'The Sound Of Music' / 'Little Donkey'\"], Discogs.com, accessed December 8, 2015.

She released a few studio albums for Columbia in the 1960s. In 1961, her singles began to chart on the [[Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks]] chart. Many of these singles became hits, peaking in the top 20, including cover versions of \"[[You Can't Be True, Dear]]\", \"[[Gentle on My Mind (song)|Gentle on My Mind]]\", and \"[[Little Green Apples]]\" (the last being her final appearance on the Billboard). Page, who as an Oklahoma native was well-acquainted with country music, recorded many country songs over the years. Some of these were recorded for Columbia and were released as adult contemporary singles, including [[David Houston (singer)|David Houston's]] \"[[Almost Persuaded (song)|Almost Persuaded]]\" and [[Tammy Wynette]]'s \"[[Stand by Your Man]]\". With Page's viability on the pop charts diminishing as she got older and with a radically changed cultural climate in America during the late 1960s, she decided to focus solely on country recordings. In 1970 she left Columbia and came back to Mercury. In 1973, she returned to working with her former record producer [[Shelby Singleton]].<ref name=oldies/>\n\nWorking for Mercury, Columbia, and Epic in the 1970s, Page recorded a series of country singles, beginning with 1970's \"I Wish I Had a Mommy Like You\", which became a top-25 hit, followed by \"Give Him Love\", which had similar success. In 1971, she released the country music album ''I'd Rather Be Sorry'' for Mercury records. In 1973, a duet with country singer [[Tom T. Hall]] titled \"Hello, We're Lonely\" was a top-20 hit, reaching number 14 on the [[Hot Country Songs|''Billboard'' country chart]].\n\nIn 1973, Page returned to Columbia Records' affiliate [[Epic Records]]. In 1974 and 1975, she released singles for Avco Records, including \"I May Not Be Lovin' You\" and a cover of [[Hoyt Axton]]'s \"Less Than The Song\", both of which were minor country hits. After a five-year hiatus, she recorded for [[Plantation Records]] in 1980. She had a top-40 hit with Plantation in 1981 titled \"No Aces\", followed by a series of minor country hits. In the early 1980s, she performed with major symphony orchestras in Cincinnati and Mexico City.\n.\n\n===Later career: 1983–2012===\nIn 1986, Page and arranger Vic Schoen reunited for a stage show in Las Vegas.\n\nIn 1988, Page appeared at the Ballroom in New York, marking the first time that she had performed there in nearly 20 years. She received positive reviews from music critics.<ref name=oldies/> In the 1990s, Page founded her own record label, C.A.F. Records, which released several records, including a 2003 children's album.<ref name=NNDB/>\n\nIn the early 1990s, Page moved to San Diego, California, and continued to perform live shows at venues across the country.\n\nIn 1998, the album ''[[Live at Carnegie Hall: The 50th Anniversary Concert]]'' was released. The album won Page a Grammy Award the following year for [[Best Traditional Pop Vocal Performance]], which, despite her prolific career, was her first Grammy.<ref name=oldies/>\n\nIn 1998, a sample of Patti Page's recording of \"Old Cape Cod\" formed the basis of [[Groove Armada]]'s UK hit \"[[At the River]]\". The lines \"If you're fond of sand dunes and salty air / Quaint little villages here and there...\" sung in Page's multitracked close harmony, are repeated over and over, with the addition of synthesizer bass, slowed-down drums, and a bluesy trombone solo to produce a [[Chill out (music)|chill-out]] track. The success of this track introduced Page's music to another generation of listeners.\n\nIn 1999, Vic Schoen reunited with Page to record a CD for a Chinese label.\n\nIn 2000, she released the album ''Brand New Tennessee Waltz''. Harmony vocals were provided by popular country stars, including [[Suzy Bogguss]], [[Alison Krauss]], [[Kathy Mattea]], and [[Trisha Yearwood]].

Page and White were put together on the phone during the interview, talking to each other about their views on \"Conquest\".<ref name=USA>{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2008-01-01-page-white_N.htm |title=Jack White, Patti Page share a 'Conquest' and a vision |work=USA Today |date=January 1, 2008 |access-date=July 23, 2008}}</ref>\n\nPage sang \"Summer Me, Winter Me\" for [[Michel Legrand]]'s 50th-anniversary concert at the MGM Grand, and on the recording, it is evident she had forgotten the words.\n\nPage continued to tour actively until September 2012, when she announced on her web page her retirement from performing for health reasons.<ref>[http://www.misspattipage.com/appearances.html Miss Patti Page – Appearances] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170626114038/http://www.misspattipage.com/appearances.html |date=2017-06-26 }} retrieved 01-03-2012.</ref>\n\n==Style==\nDuring the time of Page's greatest popularity (the late 1940s and 1950s), most of her traditional pop music contemporaries included jazz melodies in their songs. Page also incorporated jazz into some of her songs; however, on most of her recordings, Page favored a country music arrangement.\n\nDuring the late 1940s, when Page recorded for Mercury Records, its top [[A&R]] man was [[Mitch Miller]], who, despite having left Mercury for [[Columbia Records]] in 1950, produced most of Page's music. Miller found that the simple-structured melodies and story lines in country songs could be adapted to the pop market. Page, who was born in Oklahoma, felt comfortable using this idea.<ref name=contemporary/> Many of Page's more successful hits featured a country-music arrangement, including her signature song \"Tennessee Waltz\", as well as \"I Went to Your Wedding\" and \"Changing Partners\". Some of these singles charted on the ''Billboard'' country chart during the 1940s, '50s, and early '60s.\n\nMany other artists were influenced by Patti Page, and incorporated country arrangements into their own songs, including [[The Andrews Sisters]] and [[Bing Crosby]], who had a number-one hit on the country charts in the late 1940s with \"Pistol Packin' Mama\".\n\n==Personal life==\nPage was married three times, first to University of Wisconsin student Jack Skiba in May 1948. They moved to New York, but she asked for and received a no-fault divorce in Wisconsin within a year. Her next marriage was to Charles O'Curran, a choreographer, in 1956. O'Curran had been married to actress [[Betty Hutton]]. Page and O'Curran adopted a son, Danny, and a daughter, Kathleen. They divorced in 1972.\n\nPage's last marriage was to Jerry Filiciotto in 1990.<ref>Bernard Weinraub,[https://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/12/arts/patti-page-proving-that-simple-songs-endure.html \"Patti Page, Proving That Simple Songs Endure\"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', August 12, 2003.</ref> The couple owned a maple syrup business named The Farm at Wood Hill in Bath, New Hampshire, and resided in Solana Beach, California.<ref name=NNDB/><ref>[http://thebridgeweekly.com/story.php?t=o&n=991 \"Jerome J.
