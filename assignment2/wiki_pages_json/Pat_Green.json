Active since 1995, he has recorded a total of seven studio albums, including three for [[Republic Records]] and two for [[BNA Records|BNA]]. Fifteen of his singles have charted on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]], of which the highest-peaking is \"Wave on Wave\" (No.&nbsp;3) from his gold-certified album of the same name.<ref>{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p81923/biography}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/green_pat/bio.jhtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040620014231/http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/green_pat/bio.jhtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 20, 2004 |title=Pat Green Bio |publisher=CMT |access-date=April 8, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Music career==\n[[File:Pat-Green-(edited).jpg|thumb|right|225px|Pat Green performing in June 2008]]\n\nGreen started his music career as an 18-year-old at [[Texas Tech University]] playing small gigs at bars and clubs around [[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]].  In 1995, Green independently recorded and released a series of albums produced by [[Lloyd Maines]] using money borrowed from his parents.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.popmatters.com/music/interviews/green-pat-021226.shtml |title=Music Reviews, Features, Essays, News, Columns, Blogs, MP3s and Videos |magazine=PopMatters |access-date=April 8, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524230405/http://www.popmatters.com/music/interviews/green-pat-021226.shtml |archive-date=May 24, 2011 }}</ref> Green did not commit fully to his music career until 1997 when his stepfather fired him from his job as a fuel wholesaler.  Green had been counting his money from a weekend of singing and his stepfather knew he would need motivation to fully pursue music as a career.<ref name=\"americanprofile.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.americanprofile.com/articles/singer-pat-green/ |title=Singer Pat Green |publisher=American Profile |date=September 24, 2006 |access-date=April 8, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAfter committing to music, Green drew the attention of [[Willie Nelson]] and joined a tour featuring Nelson and several other famous country musicians.  Green's appearance at the 1998 Willie Nelson July 4 Picnic was his first step towards nationwide recognition, and he was soon playing sold out shows in Texas.  Green was sponsored by [[Miller Lite]] and sold more than 250,000 albums, even without signing a major label recording contract.<ref name=\"americanprofile.com\"/>\n\nGreen's first major-label recorded album, ''Three Days'', repackaged his best pre-major songs and new tracks with modern sound engineering. The album was released to acclaim in 2001. The adventurous, Beatles-influenced \"Wave on Wave\", was released in 2003, with the title track reaching number 3 on the charts by the end of the year. The album featured pop flourishes and sound engineering that was incrementally more compressed than that of \"Three Days\" but dramatically more so than that of his independent releases. The Christian-tinged title track remains Green's top career hit.\n\nGreen's mid-2000s period aimed to capitalize on his ''Wave on Wave'' commercial achievement, written by Billy Joe Parton. He achieved some critical and popular success but was unable to match his prior success and earned a \"sellout\" label.<ref name=\"Country Music Television\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/1540196/20-questions-with-pat-green/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303001621/http://www.cmt.com/news/1540196/20-questions-with-pat-green/|url-status=dead|archive-date=March 3, 2016|title=20 Questions with Pat Green}}</ref> In late 2004, \"Lucky Ones\" was Green's 3rd and final CD release on the Universal/Republic label.

CMT questioned the album as reaching for the \"uninspired pop sound of today’s Nashville,\" with songs \"starting to sound too much alike\" and \"crossing the line into Nashville pop\" and perhaps not \"honest and natural.\"<ref name=\"Country Music Television\"/> Green acknowledged that he needed hits to sustain the career that he wanted.<ref name=\"Country Music Television\"/> In 2008, Green released \"[[Let Me (Pat Green song)|Let Me]]\", as the first single from what would become his final label-released album, ''[[What I'm For]]''.  The single reached 12 on the country charts, giving Green his first Top 20 single since \"Feels Just Like It Should\" reached No.&nbsp;13 in 2006. Initially, \"Country Star\" was released as the second single, but it was withdrawn shortly after the title track (\"What I'm For\") began receiving airplay.  \"Country Star\" peaked at 32, and \"What I'm For\" peaked at 28 on the country charts in July 2009.  Green parted ways with [[BNA Records|BNA]] shortly afterward.\n\nWashed out in 2011, Green announced his return to [[Texas]] and independent music.<ref>{{cite web|author=door Texas Music Scene |url=https://www.youtube.com/user/TXmusicTV?v=ioxtMzDpVCU&feature=pyv |title=TXmusicTV |publisher=YouTube |date=April 4, 2010 |access-date=March 27, 2012}}</ref> On September 2, 2014, Taste of Country premiered the official lyric video for a new song, \"Girls from Texas\", featuring [[Lyle Lovett]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tasteofcountry.com/pat-green-girls-from-texas-lyrics-video/ |title=Pat Green Reveals 'Girls From Texas' Lyric Video |website=Tasteofcountry.com |date=September 2, 2014 |access-date=April 8, 2016}}</ref> On September 16, 2014, \"Girls from Texas\" was made available on iTunes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://patgreen.com/news/223583 |title=Pat Green |publisher=Pat Green |date=September 2, 2014 |access-date=April 8, 2016}}</ref> On May 18, 2015, Green released a new single, \"While I Was Away\".

On July 20, 2018, he released the single \"Friday's Comin'\" worldwide.\n\nOn September 2, 2022, Green released his first album in seven years, \"Miles and Miles of You\", produced by Dwight A.
