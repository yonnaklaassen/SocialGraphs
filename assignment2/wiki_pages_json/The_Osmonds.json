The group had its best-known configurations as a quartet (billed as the '''Osmond Brothers''') and a quintet (as the Osmonds). The group has consisted of siblings who are all members of a family of musicians from [[Ogden, Utah]], and have been in the public eye since the 1960s.<ref name=stilltheosmondbrothers/>\n\nThe Osmond Brothers began as a [[barbershop quartet]] consisting of brothers [[Alan Osmond|Alan]], Wayne, [[Merrill Osmond|Merrill]] and Jay.<ref name=\"stilltheosmondbrothers\" /> They were later joined by younger siblings [[Donny Osmond|Donny]] and [[Jimmy Osmond|Jimmy]], both of whom enjoyed success as solo artists.<ref name=\"Musical\"/> With the addition of Donny, the group became known as the Osmonds; performing both as [[teen idol]]s and as a [[rock music|rock]] band, their peak lasted from 1971 to 1975.<ref name=\"Musical\"/> Their only sister [[Marie Osmond|Marie]], who rarely sang with her brothers at that time, launched a successful career in 1973, both as a solo artist and as Donny's duet partner. By 1976, the band was no longer producing hit singles; that year, they transitioned into television with ''[[Donny & Marie (1976 TV series)|Donny & Marie]]'', a popular [[variety show]] that ran until 1979.\n\nA revival of the original Osmond Brothers lineup in the 1980s achieved moderate success in [[country music]], and both Donny and Marie separately made comebacks in their respective fields in the late-1980s. The Osmonds have sold over 77 million records worldwide.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.oprah.com/oprahshow/an-osmond-family-tribute |title=An Osmond Family Tribute |work=[[Harpo Productions|Oprah.com]] |access-date=March 9, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe quartet continued to perform through their 50th anniversary in 2007, at which point Alan and later Wayne retired due to health issues; Jimmy was recruited after Alan's retirement, with the group performing as a trio until Jimmy suffered a stroke and retired in 2018. On 14 October 2019, the original Osmond Brothers quartet reunited for [[CBS]]' [[The Talk (talk show)|''The Talk'']] for their sister [[Marie Osmond|Marie]]'s 60th birthday, billed as the last appearance for the lineup.

This change was difficult  for their father, who was suspicious of rock and roll, but he was persuaded and the boys began performing as a pop band. George Osmond used his military training to keep his sons strictly regimented.<ref name=stilltheosmondbrothers/>\n\nIn 1967, the Osmonds had the single \"Flower Music\" [[A-side and B-side|{{abbr|b/w|backed with}}]] \"[[I Can't Stop (The Osmonds song)|I Can't Stop]]\" released by UNI Records.<ref>Osmondmania (official Osmond website) captured 10/20/2012</ref> The song failed to become a hit.

In each of these hits, the formula was the same; Merrill sang lead, and Donny was \"co-lead\" in essence, singing the \"hook\" or \"chorus\" of the song. At this time the Osmonds also recorded several songs that were billed to Donny, the lead soloist on the songs: \"[[Sweet and Innocent (Donny Osmond song)|Sweet and Innocent]]\" (No. 7), \"[[Go Away Little Girl]]\" (No. 1), \"[[Hey Girl (Freddie Scott song)|Hey Girl]]\" (No. 9) and \"[[Puppy Love (Paul Anka song)|Puppy Love]]\" (No. 3). Uni Records also re-released their 1967 single \"Flower Music,\" this time with \"I Can't Stop\" as the A-side, where it reached No. 96. Their transition to pop stars required more elaborate [[choreography]] than their original work had required, so older brother [[Virl Osmond]] taught the quintet how to dance.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.abilitymagazine.com/donny_osmond_interview.html| work=[[Ability (magazine)|Ability]]| title=Interview with Donny Osmond| first1=Chet| last1=Cooper| first2=Dr. Gillian| last2=Friedman| access-date=October 5, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.heraldextra.com/news/local/oldest-osmond-sibling-shares-life-with-famous-family/article_017ad174-d755-55e1-a05a-33191c80ce9a.html|title=Oldest Osmond sibling shares life with famous family|first=Pam Blackwell-|last=Correspondent|website=Daily Herald|access-date=April 21, 2019}}</ref> Olive Osmond initially taught the quintet how to sing harmony; the harmony arrangements eventually fell upon Wayne, who was found to have [[absolute pitch|perfect pitch]].<ref name=stilltheosmondbrothers/>\n\n=== Transition to rock: ''Phase III'' and ''Crazy Horses'' ===\n\nThe Osmonds began writing and performing their own music, and their sound moved towards [[rock music]] beginning with their album ''[[Phase III (album)|Phase III]]''. In addition to \"Yo-Yo\", ''Phase III'' produced the major hit \"[[Down by the Lazy River]]\" (No. 4).<ref name=\"osmondbros.com\"/> Their next ''[[Crazy Horses (album)|Crazy Horses]]'' album was the band's first personal statement{{snds}}the brothers have been quoted as saying that the title song refers to air pollution from cars, and its instrumentation featured an even [[hard rock|harder rock]] sound bordering on early [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]]. They wrote all the songs and played all the instruments with Alan on rhythm guitar, Wayne on lead guitar, Merrill on lead vocals and bass, Jay on drums, and Donny on keyboards; all of the brothers sang backing vocals and an occasional lead on album cuts.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ST4NLi31PQ | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211117/6ST4NLi31PQ| archive-date=2021-11-17 | url-status=live|title=The Osmonds (video) Goin Home | date=12 November 2007|publisher=[[YouTube]] |access-date=2011-08-07}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Donny largely switched to instrumental contributions for much of 1972 to accommodate his changing voice; by 1973, Donny had settled from his former boy soprano range into a smooth [[baritenor]] voice.\n\nDonny's voice change was a major upset to the group's original formula for success, largely eliminating Merrill's young-sounding co-lead's voice and forcing Merrill's mature tenor voice to strain to cover most of the higher notes, with audible difficulty, through the next few years. The success of ''Crazy Horses'' singles \"[[Hold Her Tight]]\" (No. 14) and title track \"[[Crazy Horses (song)|Crazy Horses]]\" (on which Donny did not sing, but did contribute with a prominent keyboard riff) kept the group very popular through 1973. As the group toured, Donny continued to sing his solo hits, with the band progressively lowering the [[key (music)|key]] until his voice change was complete.\n\nWith their clean-cut image, talent, and energetic pop-rock sound, the Osmonds toured to crowds of fans across the United States. By this time, the Osmonds had broken through in the [[United Kingdom]] as well: counting group and solo recordings, members of the Osmond family charted 13 singles on the UK charts in 1973. Some observers coined a new word, \"Osmondmania\", to describe the phenomenon, by analogy with the similar \"[[Beatlemania]]\" of the previous decade. The group also had their own Saturday-morning cartoon series in 1972 and 1973, [[The Osmonds (TV series)|''The Osmonds'']], on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC-TV]].\n\n=== Emergence as teen balladeers: ''The Plan'' and ''Love Me for a Reason'' ===\n\nThe older Osmond brothers were of age to go on church missions, typically mandatory for members of the church. Noting that the Osmonds' music career was a major publicity boon for the church that had brought tens of thousands of new members, the church exempted the Osmonds from missionary service on the logic that the group served as ''de facto'' missionaries for the faith through their fame and music.<ref name=\"Inside the Osmonds DVD\"/><ref>[http://www.donny.com/question.pl/view/628//Did_You_Ever_Serve_A_Mission__And_Were_You_Born_In_The_Church.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426055831/http://www.donny.com/question.pl/view/628//Did_You_Ever_Serve_A_Mission__And_Were_You_Born_In_The_Church.html|date=April 26, 2009}}</ref><ref name=stilltheosmondbrothers/> (Merrill would eventually serve a mission in 2022 after the group disbanded.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-10-28 |title=Merrill Osmond's next gig: A Latter-day Saint mission |url=https://www.deseret.com/2022/10/27/23427297/merrill-osmond-retiring-lds-mission |access-date=2023-12-28 |website=Deseret News |language=en}}</ref>) They recorded an ambitious album in 1973 called ''[[The Plan (The Osmonds album)|The Plan]]'', perhaps best described as a Mormon [[concept album]] with [[progressive rock]] aspirations. One reviewer suggested that ''The Plan'' carried a too-strong religious message, given that Mormonism is fairly conservative and not usually associated with the themes of rock-and-roll. The reviewer likewise suggested that the music was too varied and too experimental.<ref>[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=the osmonds|chart=all}} ]{{dead link|date=August 2011}}</ref> The album produced only two minor hits: \"[[Let Me In (The Osmonds song)|Let Me In]]\" and \"[[Goin' Home (The Osmonds song)|Goin' Home]]\" (both No. 36 in the United States, although they both went top 5 in the United Kingdom and \"Let Me In\" was also a major hit on the [[easy listening]] charts).\n\nFollowing the release of ''The Plan,'' the popularity of the Osmonds as a group began to decline. Alan, Wayne, and Merrill all married their wives in 1973 and 1974 (Donny married in 1978; Jay would not marry until 1987), and the band began to slow their tour circuit.<ref name=\"Inside the Osmonds DVD\" /> ''The Plan'' was also a major departure from the pop music which made them so popular. The combination of this album, along with Donny's voice change the year before, meant that the Osmonds' popularity with young fans would wane.\n\nAnother major factor in the band's decline was the sheer diversity of its output: within three years, the Osmonds had waffled between bubblegum pop, hard rock, and easy listening, and Donny's solo career as an [[oldies]] cover artist further muddled the band's direction. Donny's collaboration with [[Steve and Eydie]], \"[[We Can Make it Together]]\" (which Alan, Wayne, and Merrill had penned for Donny), came out on the easy listening charts at the same time the much harder \"Crazy Horses\" song was charting.\n\n=== Donny's solo career, and the emergence of Marie and Jimmy as spin-off acts ===\n\n[[File:The Osmonds 1974.JPG|thumb|right|The siblings in 1974 ''(l/r)'': Jimmy, Marie, Donny, Jay, Merrill, Wayne, Alan]]\n\nDonny, Marie, and Jimmy soon began to emerge as solo artists. Jimmy was becoming \"[[big in Japan (phrase)|big in Japan]]\" and, in 1972, had a No. 1 hit in the United Kingdom with \"[[Long Haired Lover from Liverpool]]\". Marie, then 13 years old, hit No. 1 on the US country chart in 1973 with \"[[Paper Roses]]\" (a song originally recorded by [[Anita Bryant]] a decade before). Donny had a string of pop hits with [[cover version|covers]] of earlier teen-pop songs, including \"[[Go Away Little Girl]]\" (No. 1, originally by [[Steve Lawrence]]), \"[[Puppy Love (song)|Puppy Love]]\" (No. 3, a [[Paul Anka]] composition) and \"[[The Twelfth of Never]]\" (No. 8, originally recorded by [[Johnny Mathis]]). Between 1971 and 1976, Donny had twelve Top 40 hits, including five in the Top 10; for most of these, the Osmonds were still performing as a full band, but backing and giving star billing to Donny while he sang lead.\n\nDonny's numerous solo hits have led many to assume he was the group's lead singer. Merrill was usually the lead singer; Donny would usually sing the choruses on songs billed to the Osmonds, thus being a \"co-lead\". (All five members of the group sang lead at various times; Jay would sing lead on some of the group's harder rock tunes, while Alan and Wayne would occasionally contribute a lead vocal on some album tracks.) Donny's emergence as a solo star and the record company's desire to appeal to the teen-girl audience often thrust Donny out in front of the group.<ref name = \"Inside the Osmonds DVD\" />\n\nBy now the family was touring, recording, creating, and producing for five technically separate artists: The Osmonds, Donny Osmond, Marie Osmond, and Jimmy Osmond{{snds}}plus Donny and Marie had begun recording duets and had hits with \"[[I'm Leaving It Up to You]]\" (No. 4) and \"[[Morning Side of the Mountain]]\" (No. 8). Through all the stress and pressures created by these many efforts, the family hung together, largely at George's command.<ref name=stilltheosmondbrothers/> The 2001 [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]-TV movie ''[[Inside the Osmonds]]'' depicts the family mottoes as being \"It doesn't matter who's out front, as long as it's an Osmond\" and \"family, faith, and career. In that order\".<ref name = \"Inside the Osmonds DVD\" />\n\nThe original Osmonds as a group still produced hits. In 1974, \"[[Love Me for a Reason]]\" reached No. 10 in the United States and No. 1 in the United Kingdom. The Irish boy band [[Boyzone]] took the song to No. 2 in the UK in 1994. \"Love Me for a Reason\" was the title track to the [[Love Me for a Reason (album)|album of the same name]], which featured a [[blue-eyed soul]] format (their fourth style change in less than a decade) arranged by [[H.&nbsp;B. Barnum]].\n\n=== Fall from pop prominence: ''The Proud One'' and ''Brainstorm'' ===\n\n[[File:Donny and Marie Osmond Donny and Marie Show 1977.JPG|thumb|Donny and Marie, 1977]]\n\nBy 1976, though, the group's record sales were softening. Their 1975 album ''[[The Proud One (album)|The Proud One]]'' sold poorly (despite [[the Proud One (song)|the title track]], a cover of a [[Frankie Valli]] minor hit, providing a chart-topping easy listening hit and the group's last US top-40 hit to date), and MGM Records was sold to [[PolyGram]]. Their first album on the subsidiary label [[Polydor Records|Polydor]] was the album ''Brainstorm''; that album sold only slightly better than its predecessor, and its lead single, \"[[I Can't Live a Dream]]\" (another Valli cover), fell short of the top 40.  Polydor would release two more albums from the family ([[Osmond Family Christmas|a Christmas album that included all of the performing family members]], and a greatest hits compilation).{{citation needed|date=December 2022}}\n\n== Television era ==\n\nIn 1976, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] offered Donny and Marie their own television show, ''[[Donny & Marie (1976 TV series)|The Donny & Marie Show]]''. George demanded that the Osmond Brothers work behind the scenes on the show.<ref name=stilltheosmondbrothers/><ref name=\"osmondbros.com\"/> The family and ABC built and operated ''Osmond Studios'', a first-class television studio in Orem, Utah, where the show was produced beginning in 1977.<ref name=\"osmondbros.com\"/> As a result, the Osmonds as a performing band became a lower priority to Donny and Marie. The older brothers deferred or gave up their dreams of being a rock-and-roll band, although Donny and Marie as a duo continued to record hits into 1978. In an interview with ''[[The Lost 45s]]'', Wayne Osmond suggested their abandonment of songwriting and not working on material during the TV run may have been a mistake, as their career never recovered from the hiatus. Various members of the family struggled with the transition; Donny experienced stage anxiety, Merrill struggled with [[bipolar disorder]], and Marie had a brief bout with an eating disorder after a network executive told her she looked heavy.<ref name=\":0\" />{{rp|59}} Both Donny and Marie were offered roles in [[Grease (film)|the 1978 film adaptation of the hit musical]] ''[[Grease (musical)|Grease]]'', with Donny being considered for the role of the [[Beauty School Dropout|Teen Angel]] and Marie for the role of Sandy; Marie turned the role down, concerned that the character's rebellious turn at the end was not a fit for her.<ref name=greasefacts>{{Cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/grease-facts/story?id=36550893|title=7 'Grease' Facts You May Not Have Known|website=ABC News|access-date=October 2, 2021}}</ref> Donny and Marie instead chose to star in ''[[Goin' Coconuts]]'', under the belief that it would be more [[family-friendly]], which ended up being a critical and commercial failure.\n\n''The Donny & Marie Show'' was canceled in 1979, and the Osmonds found themselves in debt and without a clear direction. The group switched from Polydor to corporate affiliate [[Mercury Records]] and released another album, ''Steppin' Out'', was a transitional album for the Osmonds and was produced by [[Maurice Gibb]]. Among its tracks was the first recorded version of \"[[Rest Your Love on Me]]\", a [[country music|country song]] that became a hit for Gibb's group, the [[Bee Gees]], and topped the country charts in a cover version by [[Conway Twitty]]. ''Steppin' Out'' itself was a major failure, with the album failing to chart and its only charting single, \"You're Mine,\" reaching only to No. 138 on the ''[[Record World]]'' charts; it would be their only album on the Mercury label.\n\nThe family also produced two unsuccessful projects for Marie, a [[Marie (TV pilot)|sitcom pilot]] that never aired and a [[Marie (1980 TV series)|variety show revival]] that lasted seven episodes in 1980 and 1981.<ref name=\"Inside the Osmonds DVD\" /> Donny permanently separated from the group (and, for a time, from Marie) shortly thereafter.{{citation needed|date=December 2022}} The family also fell prey to embezzlers who came on as business partners to help finance the television show; several went to prison for their crimes.<ref name=stilltheosmondbrothers/>\n\nGeorge Osmond refused to let the family declare bankruptcy and ordered his children honor all of their financial obligations by whatever means necessary, effectively forcing the Osmonds to return to the road.<ref name=\"Inside the Osmonds DVD\" /><ref name=stilltheosmondbrothers/>\n\n== Later careers ==\n\n=== Marie Osmond ===\n{{Main|Marie Osmond}}\nMarie recorded several successful duets with Donny and continued to sing country music; she had several Top 40 country hits in the mid-1980s, the biggest of which was \"[[Meet Me in Montana]]\" with [[Dan Seals]] (No. 1). She starred in the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway revivals]] of the musicals ''[[The King and I]]'' (as the lead, Anna) and ''[[The Sound of Music]]'' (as the lead, Maria) in the mid-1990s. She returned to television first in the short-lived 1995 ABC sitcom ''Maybe This Time'' and then with Donny in 1998 to co-host ''[[Donny & Marie (1998 TV series)|Donny & Marie]]'', a talk-entertainment show that lasted two seasons.\n\nMarie suffered from [[postpartum depression]] and wanted to help other women who suffered from it.<ref>{{Cite news |date=2006-08-03 |title=Marie Osmond suicide bid denied |language=en-GB |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/5241178.stm |access-date=2023-04-25}}</ref> In 2001 Marie, Marcia Wilkie, and Dr. Judith Moore wrote a book on postpartum depression titled, ''Marie Osmond Behind the Smile''.<ref>{{Cite web |title=CNN.com - Transcripts |url=http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0105/01/lkl.00.html |access-date=2023-04-25 |website=www.cnn.com}}</ref>\n\n=== Donny Osmond ===\n{{Main|Donny Osmond}}\nDonny returned to the pop music scene in 1989; when he released \"[[Soldier of Love (Donny Osmond song)|Soldier of Love]]\" to much success in the United Kingdom, American music industry insiders were wary of the Osmond brand and promoted the song as being by a \"mystery artist\".<ref>{{cite web|author=Guy Aoki |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/1989/04/16/cmon-thats-donny/ |title=C'mon, That's Donny? |website=Articles.chicagotribune.com |date=1989-04-16 |access-date=2016-10-05}}</ref> The song became a [[turntable hit]] in this manner and, when Osmond's identity as the mystery artist was revealed, \"Soldier of Love\" eventually rose to No. 2 on the US charts and was enough of a success to warrant follow-up singles, including \"[[Sacred Emotion]]\", which peaked at No. 13, and \"[[My Love Is a Fire]],\" which peaked at No. 21. In 1998, Donny sang \"[[I'll Make a Man Out of You]]\" for the film ''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]''. He performed on Broadway as Gaston in the stage production of ''[[Beauty and the Beast (musical)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', and also gave over 2,000 performances as Joseph in the touring production of ''[[Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat]]''. He has hosted games shows in the United States and the United Kingdom (most notably the 2002{{ndash}}2004 revival of ''[[Pyramid (game show)|Pyramid]]'' and the British version of ''[[Identity (game show)|Identity]]''), continues to appear on television, winning the ninth season (Fall 2009) of ABC's ''[[Dancing with the Stars]]'', and still tours in the United States and England.\n\n==== Donny & Marie's Vegas residency ====\nFrom September 2008 to November 2019, Donny & Marie performed a 90-minute show at the [[Flamingo Las Vegas]].<ref name=\"donny-and-marie2\">{{cite news|url=http://www.flamingolasvegas.com/shows/donny-and-marie.html/|title=Donny & Marie Live at Flamingo Las Vegas Hotel and Casino|website=Flamingolasvegas.com |access-date=2015-08-25}}</ref> The show began in September 2008 and was originally scheduled to run for six months.

Alan played piano with the orchestra for most of the show and Virl and Tom provided signed lyrics for two songs.

Since Andy Williams's death, Merrill, Jay, and Jimmy took over operations of his long-running Christmas show, which they perform in [[Branson, Missouri]] in November. In 2012, the trio released their first studio album in 28 years, ''I Can't Get There Without You'', which featured the recording debut of Jimmy as lead singer.\n\nAlan and Wayne rejoined the group for one time only for what was billed as their last-ever performance as the Osmond Brothers at [[Neal S. Blaisdell Center]] in [[Honolulu]] in October 2018, a concert that also included Marie and David among the performers. Since that time, Merrill and Jay toured as \"the Osmonds\", sometimes appearing with Marie and David; in these shows (billed as \"Marie and the Osmonds\"), Jay and Merrill sing many of their old hits and substitute for the late [[Paul Davis (singer)|Paul Davis]] and Dan Seals on Marie's country duets.
