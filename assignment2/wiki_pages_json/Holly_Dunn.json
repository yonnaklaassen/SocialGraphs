Dunn recorded for [[MTM Records]] between 1985 and 1988, [[Warner Bros. Records]] between 1988 and 1993, and [[River North Records]] between 1995 and 1997. She released 10 albums and charted 19 singles, plus two duets on the [[Hot Country Songs]] charts. Two of her single releases, \"[[Are You Ever Gonna Love Me]]\" and \"[[You Really Had Me Going]]\", went to No.&nbsp;1 on that chart. Other songs for which she is known include \"[[Daddy's Hands]]\" and \"[[Maybe I Mean Yes]]\".

One of their collaborations, \"Out of Sight, Not Out of Mind\", was recorded by [[Cristy Lane]].

Her first release for the label, ''[[The Blue Rose of Texas]]'', produced her first number-one hit in \"[[Are You Ever Gonna Love Me]]\", followed by \"[[There Goes My Heart Again]]\" at number four. The latter was co-written by a then-unknown [[Joe Diffie]],<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=UDkgAAAAIBAJ&pg=7060,6118723&dq=joe-diffie&hl=en|title=Joe Diffie's Loss Was Joe Diffie's Gain|last=Sharpe|first=Jerry|date=24 November 1990|work=[[The Pittsburgh Press]]|access-date=20 July 2010}}</ref> who also sang backing vocals on it.

It included the new release \"[[Maybe I Mean Yes]]\", which became controversial due to some listeners interpreting the song as condoning [[date rape]]. As a result, Dunn asked for the single to be withdrawn from rotation.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://ew.com/article/1991/08/16/holly-dunns-controversial-single/|title=Holly Dunn's Controversial Single |last=Meyers|first=Kate|date=16 August 1991|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|access-date=17 January 2015}}</ref> Her final Warner Bros. release, ''[[Getting It Dunn]]'', failed to produce a top-40 hit, and she exited the label in 1993.<ref name=\"whitburn\"/>\n\nDunn signed to [[River North Records]] in 1995 and released two albums for the label: ''Life and Love and All the Stages'' in 1995 and ''Leave One Bridge Standing'' two years later.

It was not her first time behind the radio mike, as she had served as a DJ during her college years. However, the decision forced her to give up touring for a time.
