The daughter of an engineer and accountant, she began her life performing in [[pre-school]] plays. She also was in school choirs and performed in a rendition of \"My Fair Lady\" at a singing summer camp. Roberts began performing country music as a child. When she was in junior high and high school, she toured with her family, playing at festivals in [[North Carolina]], [[South Carolina]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. She also performed at area nursing homes (where she developed an appreciation for [[blues music]]); and worked at [[Carowinds]] (a theme park in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]]) and [[Dollywood]]. She also worked with 60- and 70-year-old men performing at nursing homes. Her influences include [[Dolly Parton]], [[Barbara Mandrell]] and [[Tanya Tucker]].\n\nShe first attended [[University of South Carolina Lancaster|USC Lancaster]] in her hometown from 1997 to 1999 before graduating from [[Belmont University]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], with a degree in business administration. Roberts performed in local clubs and restaurants until graduation, she began working for [[Mercury Nashville Records]], later becoming assistant to label head Luke Lewis. During her tenure there, she recorded a demo tape with producer Brent Rowan during her off-time. Rowan eventually played the tape for Lewis, who was favorably impressed by the recording.\n\n===Country music career===\nRoberts was signed to [[Universal Music Group Nashville]]'s Mercury Nashville division. Her debut single, \"[[Break Down Here]]\", was released on February 24, 2004. The song had previously been recorded by [[Trace Adkins]] under the title \"I'd Sure Hate to Break Down Here\". Roberts released her self-titled [[Julie Roberts (album)|debut album]] on May 25, 2004. It charted within the Top 10 of the ''Billboard'' [[Top Country Albums]] chart, peaking at No.&nbsp;9. \"Break Down Here\" became a Top 20 single on the [[Hot Country Songs]] chart, however, she never charted within the Top 40 after that. The two follow-up singles, \"The Chance\" and \"Wake Up Older\", peaked at No.&nbsp;47 and No.&nbsp;46 on the country charts, respectively. The album was then certified Gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] on December 13, 2004.\n\nIn 2006, she released her fourth single, \"Men & Mascara\", which would in-turn be the title track to her second album. ''[[Men & Mascara]]'' was released on June 27, 2006. Although not charting a single from this album, it managed to chart even higher than her debut album. It reached No.&nbsp;4 on the Top Country Albums and No.&nbsp;25 on the all-genre [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. Included on the album is a [[cover version]] of [[Saving Jane]]'s \"[[Girl Next Door (Saving Jane song)|Girl Next Door]]\", however, it failed to chart along with the album's title track.\n\nRoberts and Mercury Records parted ways at the beginning of May 2010. She released her third album \"Alive\" on June 7 as an independent artist, with the first single being \"NASCAR Party\".\n\nIn 2011, Roberts revealed that she was diagnosed with [[multiple sclerosis]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theboot.com/julie-roberts-multiple-sclerosis/|title=Julie Roberts Combats M.S.
