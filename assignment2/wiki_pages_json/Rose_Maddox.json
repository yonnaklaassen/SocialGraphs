So we left for California, the Land of Milk and Honey... We only had $35 when we left there, and a dream of going to California.  That was my mother's dream. Hitchhikin'. All of us. Five kids.... The brakemen helped us get on the right trains and they got us food from the caboose. Sometimes the brakemen locked us in the boxcars and told us to be quiet....  We got to Los Angeles, California, in 1933. The Salvation Army heard there was a family coming. They didn't have enough room there, so Dad and Cal slept in jail. At least it was a place to stay. We went from L.A. up to Oakland on the freights. We lived in Pipe City. There were these huge culvert pipes and all the migrants were living inside culverts. The mayor of Pipe City gave us his pipe to stay in. My mother got tired of asking for food every day. That's when we hit the front page of the ''Oakland Tribune'' as a family come west on the freights looking for work.</blockquote>\n\nAfter her father eventually found work, the family ended up in [[Modesto, California]].<ref name=rockabillyhall/> Rose first performed with her brothers in amateur shows at the age of 11, and while in her teens began performing with them on local radio station [[KTRB]].<ref name=modesto/><ref name=rockabilly1/> The station offered her brothers a regular slot on condition that Rose sing with them, despite the opposition of their mother, who managed the group.<ref name=rockabillyhall/><ref name=allmusic>[http://www.allmusic.com/artist/rose-maddox-mn0000290414 Biography by John Bush], ''[[AllMusic]]''.
