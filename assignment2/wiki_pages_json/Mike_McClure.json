McClure is a founding member of [[The Great Divide (band)|The Great Divide]], and was a member until he and the band parted ways in 2002. The Mike McClure Band consists of McClure (guitar, vocals), and Caleb Shirtum (bass).<ref>{{cite news |title=Mike McClure Band|url=http://www.myspace.com/mikemcclureband}}</ref>\n\nMcClure got his start in [[Stillwater, Oklahoma]], and would hang out and play music at the notorious \"Farm\" with other [[Red Dirt (music)|Red Dirt]] artists such as [[Bob Childers]], Tom Skinner, and Scott Evans. After forming The Great Divide with J.J. Lester, Scotte Lester, and Kelley Green in 1992 and contributing to six studio albums and one live two-part album, McClure set out to do his own thing.<ref>{{cite news |title=Mike McClure: The Red Dirt Rockstar|url=http://www.texasmusictimes.com/articles/0609/0609-Stricklan-McClure.php}}</ref>\n\nIn 2002, while still a member of The Great Divide, he released [[Twelve Pieces]], his first solo album. First there was Les Paul Clanton on bass and Rodney Pyeatt on guitar. Both went to do other projects. After recruiting Tom Skinner (bass) and Eric Hansen (drums), McClure had his band together. In 2004, The Mike McClure Band released their first album [[Everything Upside Down]], a hard-hitting rock album. McClure often uses the quote that his new band is \"twice as loud, and half as popular.\"<ref>{{cite news |title=Mike McClure rocks the Iron Horse with Red Dirt music|url=http://www.timesrecordnews.com/news/2008/jun/21/mike-mcclure-rocks-iron-horse-red-dirt-music/}}</ref> Since the first album, the band has put out seven more albums, including the 2004 collaboration with the Burtschi Brothers of [[Norman, Oklahoma]].
