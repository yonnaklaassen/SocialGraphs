These were eclectic collections of country and soul ballads, blues tunes, and updated versions of earlier recordings. Both 1969 albums emphasized Mack's vocals and de-emphasized his guitar work. They were modest commercial successes. Mack's final Elektra effort, ''The Hills of Indiana'', was a country album recorded in [[Nashville]] that attracted little attention.</ref> In November 1968, the newly founded ''Rolling Stone'' magazine published a rave review of Mack's discontinued 1963 debut album, persuading Elektra to re-issue it.<ref>(a) Alec Dubro, ''Rolling Stone'' magazine, November 23, 1968. (b) Elektra obliged, adding two bonus tracks from 1964 (''Farther On Down The Road'' and ''Chicken-Pickin''), under the title \"For Collectors Only\".</ref> He was soon performing in major rock venues, including the [[Fillmore East]], the [[Fillmore West]], and the [[Cow Palace]].

John Morthland wrote: \"[All] the superior chops in the world couldn't hide the fact that chubby, country Mack probably had more in common with Kentucky truck drivers than he did with the new rock audience.\"<ref>(1) Morthland, \"Lonnie Mack\", ''Output'', March 1984; (2) \"Lonnie was a real country boy\".

I ain’t really happy with a lot of the stuff I did there.\"<ref>Mack, as quoted in McDevitt, \"Unsung Guitar Hero Lonnie Mack\", Gibson on-line, September 5, 2007, at http://www.gibson.com/News-Lifestyle/Features/en-us/Unsung-Guitar-Hero-Lonnie-Mack.aspx {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160428005828/http://www.gibson.com/News-Lifestyle/Features/en-us/Unsung-Guitar-Hero-Lonnie-Mack.aspx |date=April 28, 2016 }}.</ref>\n\nAt that point in his career, Mack took a break from performing and recording. According to [[Robbie Krieger]], lead guitarist of Elektra label-mate the Doors, Mack was seen during this period \"selling Bibles out of the back of his car.\"<ref>Graff, Doors celebrate 50 years of \"Morrison Hotel:\" Q&A, The Oakland Press, Oct. 9, 2020, at https://www.theoaklandpress.com/entertainment/doors-celebrate-50-years-of-morrison-hotel-q-a/article_2a9bc814-0a4d-11eb-b11f-277180eb19ef.html</ref> He also worked for Elektra's A&R department, helping to recruit new talent.<ref>Upon completing his 1969 albums, Mack assumed a \"[[Chet Atkins]]-[[Eric Clapton]] role at Elektra, doing studio dates, producing and A&R.\" (''Rolling Stone'', \"Random Notes\", February 7, 1970, p. 4,) In that role, he helped to recruit a number of country and blues artists from Nashville, Memphis, and Muscle Shoals, Alabama. Elektra considered the launch of a specialty label to record them. (Holzman, ''Follow The Music'', First Media, 1998, pp. 366–67.) Mack was instrumental in signing [[Mickey Newbury]], but could not generate much interest in some other prospects, including [[Roberta Flack]]. (Houghton, ''Becoming Elektra'', 1st Ed., 2010, Jawbone Press, pp.244–246.) He then tried to sign [[Carole King]], but Elektra rejected her on the grounds that they already had [[Judy Collins]]. (Gettleman, ''Orlando Sentinel'', \"Guitar Hero Lonnie Mack\", as reprinted in ''Salt Lake Tribune'', August 3–4, 1993, p. 3.) Frustrated, he finally attempted to interest Elektra in gospel singer [[Dorothy Combs Morrison]], the former lead vocalist for the [[Edwin Hawkins Singers]] of \"Oh Happy Day\" fame. Mack had recorded Morrison singing a gospel-esque version of [[The Beatles]]' \"Let It Be\", and sought permission to release it; management's response was delayed, however, due to ongoing negotiations for the label's sale to Warner Brothers (Kot, Greg (December 13, 1989). \"He Wrote The Book – tribunedigital-chicagotribune\" (http://articles.chicagotribune.c{{dead link|date=March 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} om/1989-12-13/features/8903170595_1_doors-morrison-hotel-memphis-man-lonnie-mack).

According to a close associate, Mack \"had no tolerance for the internal politics of the music business\". (Hear, interview of Stuart Holman (Mack's bass-player in the early '70s), \"Lonnie Mack Special\", July 16, 2011, at\nhttp://wvxu.org/post/lonnie-mack-special#stream/0.) Finally, Mack resigned from his A&R job. (Sandmel, \"Lonnie Mack is Back on the Track\", ''Guitar World'', May 1984, pp. 59–60.)</ref> In 1971, with one album left to complete his contract with Elektra, Mack moved to [[Nashville]]. There, he recorded ''[[The Hills of Indiana]]'', a multi-genre (but country-flavored) LP with a vocal emphasis.<ref name=\"Davidson\" /> It included only one track showcasing his guitar virtuosity, \"Asphalt Outlaw Hero\". ''The Hills of Indiana'' attracted little attention.\n\nMack had begun missing the fun of small-town performance venues early in his time with Elektra<ref>Mary Campbell, \"Blues Guitarist Mack Is Back\", Terre Haute Tribune-Star, November 2, 1969, p. 66.</ref> and soon soured on the fantasy of rock celebrity status. \"[It had] a lot to do with how much value you put on money as opposed to what makes you happy. I wasn't happy.

Towards the end of Mack's time at Elektra, the label had put together a musical whistle-stop touring group, including Mack, Don Nix, and others, billed as \"The Alabama State Troupers and Mount Zion Choir\". (Holzman, Follow The Music, First Media, 2000, p. 36.) According to Elektra producer Russ Miller, Mack disappeared six days before the tour was to begin. Miller found him hiding out on his rustic Kentucky farm. Mack refused to join the tour, citing a nightmare during his last night in Los Angeles, in which he and his family had been pursued by Satan. He had awakened in a sweat, finding his Bible opened to a passage warning him to \"flee from Mount Zion\". Miller, a former evangelist preacher (Houghton, Becoming Elektra, 1st Ed., 2010, Jawbone Press, pp.244–246), knew Mack's mind. Returning to California alone, Miller explained: \"[Lonnie's] a real country boy. [T]hat was it for Lonnie\". (Holzman, ''supra''). Mack wrote a tune relating to this experience. In \"A Song I Haven't Sung\" (1986), he equated the pursuit of \"fortune and fame\" with selling one's soul to Satan, allowing the \"body to live while your soul is left to rot\". The tune appears on Mack's 1986 Alligator album, \"Second Sight\".</ref> On another occasion, Mack said: \"Seems like every time I get close to really making it, to climbing to the top of the mountain, that's when I pull out. I just pull up and run.\"<ref>Mack, as quoted in Guralnick, Pickers, \"Lonnie Mack: Fiery Picker Goes Country\", 1977, pp. 16–18.</ref> Upon Mack's death in 2016, music historian [[Dick Shurman]] observed that Mack's temperament \"wasn't suited to stardom. I think he'd rather have been hunting and fishing. He didn't like cities or the (music) business.\"<ref>(1) Dick Shurman, as quoted in McArdle, \"Lonnie Mack, Guitarist and Singer Who Influenced Blues and Rock Acts, Dies at 74\", [[Washington Post]] April 25, 2016, at [https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/lonnie-mack-guitarist-and-singer-who-influenced-blues-and-rock-acts-dies-at-74/2016/04/25/5c581f3c-0a44-11e6-bfa1-4efa856caf2a_story.html.1]{{dead link|date=June 2021|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}).

Three years before his death, Vaughan listed Mack first among the guitarists he had listened to, both as a youngster and as an adult. (Vaughan interview at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcrkPrxj698). As a teen-ager, Vaughan honed his guitar skills by playing along with ''Wham!'', starting and stopping the record-player repeatedly as he attempted to copy Mack's guitar.

More recently, Jeff Beck regularly performed ''Lonnie on the Move'' during his 2015 and 2016 tours.  It is a direct copy of Mack's own live, 1990 version. Beck probably first heard the tune when it was issued in Britain on the Stateside label in 1964.

They raised the bar for rock guitar proficiency, helped propel the electric guitar to the top of soloing instruments in rock, and served as prototypes for the genres of blues rock and Southern rock.\n\nInterviewed for a biography of Southern Rock guitar legend [[Duane Allman]], guitarist and early Allman associate Mike Johnstone recalled the professional impact of Mack's rock guitar proficiency when he and Allman were starting out:<ref>Poe, \"Skydog: The Duane Allman Story\", Backbeat, 2006, at p. 10.</ref>\n\n{{blockquote | Now, [in 1963], there was a popular song on the radio called 'Memphis'—an instrumental by Lonnie Mack.

That's how good you have to be now.' }}\n\nAnother player of that era observed: \"Lonnie Mack made the other guitar-slingers of the day – [[Duane Eddy]], [[Dick Dale]], [[the Ventures]] – sound tame by comparison. Only [[Travis Wammack]] and [[Link Wray]] came close.\"<ref>Windham, \"REVIEW: Lonnie Mack made other guitarists in his day sound tame by comparison\", Tuscaloosa News, 11/13/2003, preserved on-line at https://www.tuscaloosanews.com/story/news/2003/11/14/review-lonnie-mack-made-other-guitarists-in-his-day-sound-tame-by-comparison/27851967007/</ref>\n\nMack's \"edgy, aggressive, loud, and fast\" blues guitar sound is also credited with a key role in the electric guitar's rise to the top of soloing instruments in rock. Blues critic Shawn Hagood wrote:<ref name=\"auto\" />\n\n{{blockquote | His playing was faster, louder, more aggressive than anything people were used to hearing. He essentially paved the way for the electric guitar to become a soloing instrument in rock music. A true blues-rock pioneer, the genre would not have been the same – indeed, much of rock music might not have been the same – without his innovative way of treating the electric guitar as a lead soloing instrument in rock – edgy, aggressive, loud and fast. }}\n\nFormer Elektra [[A&R]] executive James Webber agrees:<ref>Greg Schaber, \"Mule Train\", Cincinnati Magazine, October 2000 issue, pp. 74–83, as preserved at https://books.google.com/books?id=2O0CAAAAMBAJ&dq=schaber+mule+train&pg=PA73</ref>\n\n{{blockquote | Lonnie took rock guitar playing to a whole different level. You had to really play now. [B]efore Lonnie, the sax guys did all of the lead work. He made the guitar the preeminent lead instrument. }}\n\nMack's early-1960s guitar tracks are said to have set the stage for blues-rock guitar and Southern rock guitar, styles that first enjoyed broad popularity a few years later. From ''Legends of Rock Guitar'' (1997):<ref>Brown & Newquist, Legends of Rock Guitar, \"Lonnie Mack\", Hal Leonard Publishing, 1997, p. 24.</ref>\n\n{{blockquote | [Mack] is essentially the missing guitar link between the twangy, multi-string riffing of rockabilly and the bluesy, string-pushing players of the mid-sixties. He also made the crucial bridge between the black blues and white hillbilly music via his lead work...In all, it is not an exaggeration to say that Lonnie Mack was well ahead of his time in 1963. His bluesy solos predated the pioneering blues-rock guitar work of Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton, and Mike Bloomfield by nearly two years. [Since] ''they'' are considered \"before their time\", the chronological significance of Lonnie Mack for the world of rock guitar is that much more remarkable. }}\n\nSouthern rock ([[Allman Brothers]]) lead guitarist [[Warren Haynes]] expressed a similar assessment:<ref name=\"Warren Haynes\">{{cite web|url=http://www.warrenhaynes.net/news/detail/warren_haynes_reflects_on_lonnie_mack|title=Warren Haynes – news|website=Warrenhaynes.net|access-date=August 28, 2018}}</ref>\n\n{{blockquote | Guitar players, true musicians, and real music fans realize that Lonnie was the Jimi Hendrix of his time.

Mack favored thick (heavy) strings, i.e., .010, .012, .018w, .028, .038, .052. He typically only bent the first (higher) two, and used a wound string only for the third.

(2) The blue-eyed soul vocals on Mack's debut album, ''The Wham of that Memphis Man'' (1963) came at a time when the racial divide in American culture was epitomized by the difference between black and white pop music styles. (Kirkus Review of the book, ''Country Soul'', by Charles L. Hughes, U. of North Carolina Press, 2015, at https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/charles-i-hughes/country-soul/). When Mack's first vocal recordings were released in 1963, Mack's gospel-inspired version of the soul ballad \"Where There's a Will\" was played on R&B radio stations throughout the Deep South. Soon, he was invited to give a live radio interview with a prominent R&B disc jockey in racially polarized Birmingham, Alabama.
