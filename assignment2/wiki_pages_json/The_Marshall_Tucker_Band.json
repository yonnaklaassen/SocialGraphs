[[Wet Willie]] lead singer [[Jimmy Hall]] told Toy Caldwell to book the band at Grant's Lounge in [[Macon, Georgia]], which he did. After hearing the band play at Grant's Lounge, Buddy Thornton and [[Paul Hornsby]] recorded the band's [[demo (music)|demo]] at [[Capricorn Records|Capricorn Studios]].
