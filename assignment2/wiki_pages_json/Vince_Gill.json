He began in a number of local [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] bands in the 1970s, and from 1978 to 1982, he achieved his first mainstream attention as lead singer of the [[soft rock]] band [[Pure Prairie League]]. Gill sang lead on their hit single \"[[Let Me Love You Tonight]]\" in addition to writing several songs of theirs. After leaving Pure Prairie League, Gill briefly played guitar in [[Rodney Crowell]]'s backing band [[the Cherry Bombs]] before beginning a solo career in [[country music]] in 1984. Gill recorded for [[RCA Records Nashville]] from then until 1988 with minimal success. A year later he signed with [[MCA Nashville]], and he has recorded for this label ever since.\n\nHis commercial peak came in the first half of the 1990s, starting with his breakthrough album ''[[When I Call Your Name (album)|When I Call Your Name]]''. Gill has 65 entries on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts, including four solo number one hits: \"[[I Still Believe in You (Vince Gill song)|I Still Believe in You]]\", \"[[Don't Let Our Love Start Slippin' Away]]\", \"[[One More Last Chance]]\", and \"[[Tryin' to Get Over You]]\", all between 1992 and 1994. He has also had number-one singles as a guest on [[Reba McEntire]]'s \"[[The Heart Won't Lie]]\" in 1993, as well as [[Chris Young (singer)|Chris Young]]'s \"[[Sober Saturday Night]]\" and the multi-artist collaboration \"[[Forever Country]]\", both in 2016. All of Gill's albums released in the 1990s were certified platinum or higher by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), with the highest being 1992's ''[[I Still Believe in You (album)|I Still Believe in You]]'' at quintuple-platinum. Gill has won 22 [[Grammy Awards]], the most among solo male country music artists.\n\nGill was a member of [[Western swing]] group [[the Time Jumpers]] from 2010 to 2020, and joined the rock band [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]] in 2017 following the death of longtime member [[Glenn Frey]]. He has also participated in a variety of collaborations, including songs by [[Patty Loveless]], [[Brooks & Dunn]], [[Kelly Clarkson]], and [[Maren Morris]]. From 1980 to 1997 he was married to Janis Oliver, one-half of the country duo [[Sweethearts of the Rodeo]]; after they divorced, he married [[contemporary Christian music]] singer [[Amy Grant]] in 2000. Additionally, Gill has written songs for [[Alabama (band)|Alabama]] and [[Ty Herndon]], and holds a number of credits as a backing vocalist and session musician.\n\nGill's music is known for his songwriting, his [[tenor]] singing voice, and his lead guitar work, with many critics noting his prolificacy in both ballads and up-tempo material. In addition to guitar, Gill plays [[mandolin]], [[banjo]], and [[Dobro]]. He has been referred to as the \"nicest guy in Nashville\" due to his pleasant mannerisms and frequent contributions to charity.\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Norman July 2019 15 (E Main Street).jpg|200px|thumb|left|Gill was born in [[Norman, Oklahoma]].|alt=Businesses along a street in Norman, Oklahoma.]]\nVincent Grant Gill was born April 12, 1957, in [[Norman, Oklahoma]],{{sfn|Sgammato|1999|page=21}}{{Sfn|Whitburn|2017|pages=140-141}}<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/vince-gill-mn0000214162 | title=Vince Gill biography | publisher=[[AllMusic]] | accessdate=March 25, 2024 | author=Steve Huey}}</ref> as the youngest of three children to Jerene and Stan Gill.<ref name=\"okhistory\">{{cite web | url=https://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry?entry=GI006 | title=Vince Gill | publisher=The Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture | accessdate=March 25, 2024}}</ref>{{sfn|Sgammato|1999|page=26}} Stan Gill worked as a [[judge]] and also played guitar and [[banjo]], both of which he also taught his son how to play.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/><ref name=\"fame\">{{cite web | url=https://www.countrymusichalloffame.org/hall-of-fame/vince-gill | title=Vince Gill | publisher=[[Country Music Hall of Fame]] | accessdate=April 18, 2024}}</ref> Jerene also sang and played [[harmonica]].<ref name=\"cst remz\"/> The Gill family often listened to the [[Grand Ole Opry]] on the radio, as well as contemporary [[rock and roll]] artists.{{sfn|Sgammato|1999|page=23}} Both parents also enjoyed [[golf]], a pastime which Gill himself would develop as well.<ref name=\"bmi\">{{cite web | url=https://www.bmi.com/news/entry/20030828_pga_honors_bmi_country_star_vince_gill | title=PGA Honors BMI Country Star Vince Gill | publisher=[[Broadcast Music, Inc.]] | date=August 27, 2003 | accessdate=April 18, 2024}}</ref> As a child, Gill began playing a guitar his grandmother owned, and learned how to play \"[[Old Shep]]\" on it when he was five years old; three years later, he and his half-brother Bob played [[the Beach Boys]]' \"Long Tall Texan\" on a local radio show.
