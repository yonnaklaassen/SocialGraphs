Daughter Lynn was signed to a recording contract to [[Chart Records]] in 1966 after she was heard singing along with her mother at an industry function. Previously she had recorded some demo tapes of her mother's songs and appeared on television in California on regional country music shows. In 1967, she had her first top ten hit with the single \"[[If I Kiss You (Will You Go Away)]]\". Soon after, Anderson joined the cast of ''[[The Lawrence Welk Show]]'', where she performed country music weekly to a national audience.\n\nIn 1970, Anderson signed with [[Columbia Records]], where she was produced by her first husband, [[Glenn Sutton]]. She had her biggest commercial success with \"Rose Garden\". The song reached positions on the ''Billboard'' country, pop, and adult contemporary charts, also charting in other countries and earning her a [[Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance]]. Throughout the decade, Anderson also had number-one hits with \"[[You're My Man]]\", \"[[How Can I Unlove You]]\", \"[[Keep Me in Mind (Lynn Anderson song)|Keep Me in Mind]]\", and \"[[What a Man My Man Is]]\".

The album spawned three singles, including the top ten hit \"[[You're Welcome to Tonight]]\", with [[Gary Morris]]. She continued recording sporadically throughout the 1980s. This included a revival of the pop hit \"[[Under the Boardwalk]]\" and the studio album ''[[What She Does Best]]'' (1988). Anderson continued releasing new albums into the new millennium, such as 2004's ''[[The Bluegrass Sessions (Lynn Anderson album)|The Bluegrass Sessions]]''. Towards the end of her life, Anderson struggled with alcohol addiction, but continued performing until her death in 2015. For her work as a crossover artist, she was ranked on ''[[Rolling Stone]]'''s list of the \"100 Greatest Country Artists of All Time\" and ''[[Country Music Television|CMT]]''s \"40 Greatest Women of Country Music\".\n\n==Early life==\nLynn Rene Anderson was born in [[Grand Forks, North Dakota]], on September 26, 1947, to Casey and [[Liz Anderson]].<ref name=\"Billboard Obituary\">{{cite magazine |last1=Dauphin |first1=Chuck |title=Lynn Anderson, Country Star Behind 'Rose Garden,' Dies at 67 |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/obituary/6649400/lynn-anderson-country-star-rose-garden-dead |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=July 31, 2015 |access-date=June 2, 2020}}</ref> Her grandparents were Scandinavian immigrants who established a North Dakota \"saddle club\".
