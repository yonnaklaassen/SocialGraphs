He was a [[Nashville sound]] (country/popular music) innovator of the late 1950s, and scored 147 songs on the ''[[Billboard Magazine|Billboard]]'' country music charts, second only to [[George Jones]]. He sold more than 85 million records. A member of the [[Grand Ole Opry]] (beginning 1943) and the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] (beginning 1966), Arnold ranked 22nd on [[Country Music Television]]'s 2003 list of \"The 40 Greatest Men of Country Music.\"\n\n== Early years ==\nArnold was born on May 15, 1918, on a farm near [[Henderson, Tennessee]]. His father, a [[Sharecropping|sharecropper]], played the [[fiddle]], while his mother played guitar. Arnold's father died when he was just 11, forcing him to leave school and begin helping on the family farm. This led to him later gaining his nickname, the '''Tennessee Plowboy'''. Arnold attended [[Pinson High School]] in [[Pinson, Tennessee]], where he played guitar for school functions and events. He quit before graduation to help with the farm work, but continued performing, often arriving on a mule with his guitar hung on his back. Arnold also worked part-time as an assistant at a [[mortuary]].<ref name=\"cmenc\">{{cite book|last=Stambler|first=Irwin|author2=Grelun Landon |author3=Lyndon Stambler |title=Country Music: An Encyclopedia|publisher=Macmillan Publishers|year=2000|pages=17–19|isbn=978-0-312-26487-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RjfB6-nVHZIC&q=Eddy+Arnold&pg=PA17|access-date=July 15, 2009}}</ref>\n[[File:Downtown henderson tennessee.jpg|left|thumb|Downtown Henderson, Tennessee, the city near which Arnold was born]]\n\nIn 1934, at age 16, Arnold made his debut on WTJS-AM in [[Jackson, Tennessee]].

Arnold annoyed many in the country music establishment by recording with [[Hugo Winterhalter]] and his Orchestra at the [[RCA Studios New York#24th St|RCA Victor Studios]] in New York. Winterhalter's pop-oriented arrangements of \"[[The Cattle Call]]\" and \"The Richest Man (in the World)\", however, helped to expand Arnold's appeal beyond its country music base.<ref name=\"encm\">{{cite book|last=Rumble|first=John|title=The Encyclopedia of Country Music|url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofco00coun|url-access=registration|editor=Paul Kingsbury|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1998|isbn=978-0-19-511671-7}}</ref> This style, pioneered by Reeves and Arnold, became known as the \"[[Nashville Sound]]\".<ref name=\"encm\" /> During 1953, Arnold and Tom Parker had a dispute, and Arnold fired him.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ward |first=Ed |date=2016 |title=The History of Rock & Roll, volume one, 1920–1963 \n|location=New York |publisher=Flatiron Books |page=103 |isbn=978-1-250-07116-3 |author-link=Ed Ward (writer)}}</ref> From 1954 to 1963, Arnold's performances were managed by Joe Csida; in 1964, Csida was replaced by Jerry Purcell.<ref name=\"skyline\">{{cite news|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1587136/nashville-skyline-remembering-eddy-arnold.jhtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512152607/http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1587136/nashville-skyline-remembering-eddy-arnold.jhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 12, 2008|title=NASHVILLE SKYLINE: Remembering Eddy Arnold|last=Flippo|first=Chet|date=May 8, 2008|publisher=Country Music Television|access-date=July 15, 2009}}</ref>\n\nArnold embarked on a second career that brought his music to a more diverse audience. In the summer of 1965, he had his first number-one country song in 10 years, \"[[What's He Doing in My World]]\" and struck gold again six months later with the song that became his most well-known, \"[[Make the World Go Away]]\", accompanied by pianist [[Floyd Cramer]] on piano and featuring the [[Anita Kerr]] Singers.
