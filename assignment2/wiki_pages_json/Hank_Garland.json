He started as a country musician, played rock and roll as it became popular in the 1950s, and released a jazz album in 1960. His career was cut short when a car accident in 1961 left him unable to perform.\n\nThe Hank Garland biopic ''Crazy'' was released in 2008.<ref name=\"Crazy\">{{cite web |title=Crazy|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0443474/|website=IMDB|access-date=11 November 2022}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\nBorn in [[Cowpens, South Carolina]],<ref name=\"AMbio\">{{cite web |last1=Ginell |first1=Richard S. |title=Hank Garland |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/hank-garland-mn0000666285/biography |website=AllMusic |access-date=16 January 2019}}</ref> Garland began playing guitar at the age of six, and began to appear on local radio shows at 12.  At 14 he moved to [[Spartanburg, South Carolina]] where he met [[Don Reno]] who gave him lessons, and worked with him on the [[WSPA-FM]] station in Spartanburg, both playing lead guitar. <ref name=\"Guitarist\">{{cite magazine |title=Guitarist Hank Garland Dies |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/65186/guitarist-hank-garland-dies |magazine=Billboard |access-date=16 January 2019 |date=28 December 2004}}</ref>\n\nHe moved to Nashville at age 16, staying in Ma Upchurch's boarding house, where he roomed with [[Bob Moore (musician)|Bob Moore]] and Dale Potter. At age 18, he recorded his million-selling hit \"[[Sugarfoot Rag]]\".<ref name=\"Campilongo\">{{cite web |last1=Campilongo |first1=Jim |title=Listen to Hank Garland's 'Jazz Winds From a New Direction' – the Album That Made George Benson Want to Play Jazz |url=https://www.guitarplayer.com/players/listen-to-hank-garlands-jazz-winds-from-a-new-direction-the-album-that-made-george-benson-want-to-play-jazz |website=Guitar Player |language=en |date=20 January 2023}}</ref> He appeared on the ''Jubilee'' program with [[Grady Martin]]'s band and on ''[[The Eddy Arnold Show]]''. Garland is perhaps best known for his Nashville studio work with [[Elvis Presley]] from 1958 to 1961 which produced such rock hits as: \"I Need Your Love Tonight\", \"A Big Hunk o' Love\", \" I'm Coming Home\", \"I Got Stung\", \"[[A Fool Such As I]]\", \"Stuck on You\", \"[[Little Sister (Elvis Presley song)|Little Sister]]\", \"[[(Marie's the Name) His Latest Flame]]\", and \"I Feel So Bad\". He worked with many country music and rock and roll musicians of the late 1950s and early 1960s, such as [[Patsy Cline]], [[Brenda Lee]], [[Mel Tillis]], [[Marty Robbins]], [[The Everly Brothers]], [[Boots Randolph]], [[Roy Orbison]], [[Conway Twitty]], and [[Moon Mullican]].\n\nGarland's guitar drove such classic recordings as [[Little Jimmy Dickens]]' \"I Got a Hole in My Pocket\"; [[Benny Joy]]'s \"Bundle of Love\" and \"I'm Gonna Move\"; Jimmy Lloyd's (recorded under pseudonym of ([[Jimmie Logsdon]]) \"You're Gone Baby\" and \"I've Got a Rocket in My Pocket\"; [[Lefty Frizzell]]'s \"You're Humbuggin' Me\"; [[Simon Crum]]'s \"Stand Up, Sit Down, Shut Your Mouth\"; and [[Johnnie Strickland]]'s (1935-1994) \"She's Mine\"; plus, seasonal staples \"[[Jingle Bell Rock]]\" with [[Bobby Helms]], and [[Brenda Lee]]'s seasonal \"[[Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree]]\". [[Don Gibson]]'s \"Sweet Sweet Girl\" and \"Don't Tell Me Your Troubles\"; [[Patsy Cline]]'s \"Let the Teardrops Fall\"; [[Ronnie Hawkins]]' \"[[Jambalaya]]\"; and [[Faron Young]]'s \"Alone with You\" spotlighted Garland's guitar work.\n\nHe played with [[George Shearing]] and [[Charlie Parker]] in New York and went on to record ''Jazz Winds from a New Direction''<ref name=\"Ginell\">{{cite web |last1=Ginell |first1=Richard S. |title=Jazz Winds from a New Direction |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/jazz-winds-from-a-new-direction-mw0000615502 |website=AllMusic |access-date=16 January 2019 }}</ref> with [[Gary Burton]] on vibraphone, [[Joe Benjamin]] on double bass, and [[Joe Morello]] on drums.<ref name=\"Campilongo\" /> That session took place in Nashville in 1960.  \n\nThat same year, Garland, along with other members of the [[The Nashville A-Team|Nashville \"A-Team\"]] of session players, was invited to perform at the [[Newport Jazz Festival]].  For years, these musicians unwound by playing jazz after hours at Nashville's Carousel Club. The group included Gary Burton on vibes, guitarist [[Chet Atkins]], pianist [[Floyd Cramer]], saxophonist [[Boots Randolph]], bassist [[Bob Moore (musician)|Bob Moore]], drummer [[Buddy Harman]] and African-American violinist [[Brenton Banks]], who played in the string sections that adorned many Nashville recordings.  [[RCA Victor]] had a mobile recording unit there to record their performance, but when rioting prematurely ended the festival, the group performed (with the tapes rolling) on the porch of the mansion where they were staying.  The album was released as ''[[After the Riot in Newport]]''.\n\nAt the request of [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson Guitar]] company president [[Ted McCarty]], Garland and guitarist [[Billy Byrd]]<ref name=\"Campilongo\" /> influenced the design of the [[Gibson Byrdland|Byrdland]] guitar, which derived from the [[Gibson L-5]], having a slimmer body and shorter scale for ease of playing.<ref name=\"gibson\">{{cite book |last1=Duchossoir |first1=Andre R. |title=Gibson Electrics: The Classic Years |date=1998 |publisher=Hal Leonard Corp |isbn=0-7935-9210-0 |pages=57–60}}</ref>\n\nIn September 1961, a car crash left Garland in a coma.<ref name=\"Guitarist\" /> He regained consciousness and recovered with the help of his wife, Evelyn, and two daughters, but due to a brain injury sustained in the car accident, he was unable to return to the studios. After Evelyn died at the age of 38 in a car crash in [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]] on December 2, 1965, Garland's parents took care of him until their deaths. He then went to live with his brother, Billy and wife Amy. \n\nGarland suffered from constant ill health in his later years and died in [[Orange Park, Florida]] on December 27, 2004, of complications from a staph infection. He was 74 years old. He is interred in Jacksonville Memory Gardens in Orange Park.\n\n==Discography==\n===As leader===\n* ''Velvet Guitar'' (Harmony, 1960)\n* ''[[After the Riot at Newport]]'' with the Nashville All-Stars (RCA Victor, 1961)\n* ''Jazz Winds from a New Direction'' (Columbia, 1961)\n* ''The Unforgettable Guitar of Hank Garland'' (Columbia, 1962)\n* ''Hank Garland and His Sugar Footers'' (Bear Family, 1992)\n* ''Subtle Swing'' (Sundazed, 2004)\n\n===As sideman===\n* [[Red Foley]] and [[Ernest Tubb]], ''Red and Ernie'' (Decca, 1956)\n* [[Bobby Helms]], ''[[Jingle Bell Rock]]'', (Decca 30513A, November 1957)\n* [[Janis Martin]], ''The Female Elvis: The Complete Recordings'' (1956-57, released on [[Bear Family Records]], 1987)\n* [[Elvis Presley]], [[50,000,000 Elvis Fans Can't Be Wrong: Elvis' Gold Records, Volume 2]] (RCA Victor, 1959)\n* [[Elvis Presley]], [[Elvis Is Back!]] (RCA Victor, 1960)\n* [[Billy Walker (singer)|Ray Walker]], ''Everybody's Hits But Mine'' (Columbia, 1961)\n* [[The Everly Brothers]], ''[[Both Sides of an Evening]]'' (Warner Bros., 1961)\n* [[Don Gibson]], ''Girls, Guitars, and Gibson'' (RCA Victor, 1961)\n* Elvis Presley, [[Something for Everybody]] (RCA Victor, 1961)\n* Elvis Presley, [[Follow that Dream (EP)]] (RCA Victor, 1961)\n* Elvis Presley, [[Pot Luck (Elvis Presley album)|Pot Luck]] (RCA Victor, 1962)\n* Elvis Presley, Elvis’ Golden Records, Volume 3 (RCA Victor, 1962)\n* [[Skeeter Davis]], ''Blueberry Hill and Other Favorites'' (RCA Camden, 1965)\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Kienzle, Rich (1998). \"Hank Garland\".
