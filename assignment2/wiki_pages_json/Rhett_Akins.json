Signed to [[Decca Records]] between 1994 and 1997, he released two albums for that label (1995's ''[[A Thousand Memories]]'' and 1996's ''[[Somebody New (album)|Somebody New]]''), followed by 1998's ''[[What Livin's All About]]'' on [[Universal Music Group Nashville|MCA Nashville]]. ''[[Friday Night in Dixie]]'' was released in 2002 on [[Audium Entertainment]]. Overall, his albums have accounted for fourteen singles on the [[Hot Country Songs|''Billboard'' Hot Country Songs]], including the number one \"[[Don't Get Me Started]]\" from 1996.\n\nAlthough he has not charted a single since 2006, Akins has written singles for other country music singers, primarily as one-third of the songwriting team [[The Peach Pickers]], alongside [[Dallas Davidson]] and [[Ben Hayslip]]. He is also the father of country singer [[Thomas Rhett]].\n\n==Early life==\nThomas Rhett Akins Sr. was born on October 13, 1969, in [[Valdosta, Georgia]], to Pamela (née LaHood) and Thomas Akins.<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p141711/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Rhett Akins biography |access-date=2008-03-09 |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |work=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> By age 11, he and his two younger brothers had formed a band.<ref name=\"encyclocountry\">{{cite book|title=The Encyclopedia of Country Music|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tLZz02EzmBYC&pg=PA166|date=1 February 2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-992083-9|page=7}}</ref>  Rhett played football at the [[University of Georgia]] and studied business but gave up his studies after a year. He then worked for his father’s oil and gas distribution company.\n\n==Career==\n===1992–1994: Move to Nashville and recording contract===\nIn 1992,<ref name=\"encyclocountry\"/> after performing in the theme park show \"Music Country Music\" at Fiesta Texas in San Antonio, Texas, Akins moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], and performed in \"Country Music USA\" at Opryland Theme Park. Akins then became a demo singer before [[Decca Records]] signed him to a recording contract.<ref name=\"encyclocountry\"/>\n\n===1994–1997: ''A Thousand Memories'' and ''Somebody New''===\nAkins's first single was \"What They're Talkin' About\", a No.&nbsp;35 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country charts in late 1994, followed by the No.&nbsp;36 \"I Brake for Brunettes\". After these first two singles came his signature song, \"[[That Ain't My Truck]]\". This was his breakthrough hit, peaking at No.&nbsp;3 on the country charts in mid-1995. All three of these songs were included on his 1995 debut album ''[[A Thousand Memories]]'', which also produced the No.&nbsp;17 \"She Said Yes\". Also in 1995 and 1996, Akins toured with [[Reba McEntire]].<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> In 1995, he was named one of ''Country America's'' \"Top New Stars\".<ref name=\"encyclocountry\"/>\n\nAkins' second album, ''[[Somebody New (album)|Somebody New]]'', produced his only number one hit in \"[[Don't Get Me Started]]\", which peaked in August 1996. The other three singles from ''Somebody New'' were less successful, with \"Love You Back\" (the second single) becoming his last top 40 hit at No.&nbsp;38.\n\n===1997–2004: Transfer to MCA Nashville, ''What Livin's All About'', and ''Friday Night in Dixie''===\nAfter Decca's Nashville division was merged into [[Universal Music Group Nashville|MCA Nashville]] in 1997, Akins was transferred to MCA Nashville for the release of his third album, 1998's ''[[What Livin's All About]]''. This album was even less successful, however, with its lead-off single \"More Than Everything\" falling one space short of top 40 in the U.S., although it was a No.&nbsp;25 hit on the ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' country charts in Canada. Also in 1998, Akins charted with a cover of [[Eddie Rabbitt]]'s 1980 number one hit \"[[Drivin' My Life Away]]\", which Akins covered on the soundtrack to the 1998 film ''[[Black Dog (1998 film)|Black Dog]]''.\n\nIn 2000, he voiced the character of Tom Sawyer in MGM's animated remake of ''[[Tom Sawyer (2000 film)|Tom Sawyer]]'' alongside fellow country singer [[Mark Wills]], who voiced Huckleberry Finn, as well as [[Lee Ann Womack]], who voiced Becky's singing voice. A fourth album, ''[[Friday Night in Dixie]]'', was released in 2002 on [[Koch Records]]. This album's only two singles, \"Highway Sunrise\" and \"In Your Love\", peaked at No.&nbsp;55 and No.&nbsp;57, respectively.\n\n===2005–2006: BNA Records and ''People Like Me''===\nAkins did not release another single until his signing with [[BNA Records]] in 2005, when he released the No.&nbsp;57-peaking \"Kiss My Country Ass\", which was later recorded by [[Blake Shelton]] for his 2010 extended play ''[[Hillbilly Bone]]''. It was included on his album ''People Like Me'', which was originally to have been released via BNA on June 14, 2006, but was ultimately self-released in June 2007. \"[[If Heaven Wasn't So Far Away]]\" was the second single from ''People Like Me'', which failed to chart for Akins, but was later recorded by [[Justin Moore]], whose version went to number 1. ''Down South'' followed in 2008, as did its only single, the title track, which again failed to chart.\n\n===2009–2010: ''Michael Waddell's Bone Collector: The Brotherhood Album''===\nIn 2009, Akins released the single \"Hung Up\", which did not chart. It was later included on the 2010 album ''Michael Waddell's Bone Collector: The Brotherhood Album'', a collaboration with fellow [[country music]] singer [[Dallas Davidson]], released through [[Reprise Records]] Nashville.\n\n===Songwriting career===\nIn the late 2000s, Akins began writing songs for other artists, primarily with [[Ben Hayslip]] and [[Dallas Davidson]], collaboratively known as [[The Peach Pickers]]. Among the singles that Akins has co-written are \"[[Put a Girl in It]]\" recorded by [[Brooks & Dunn]], \"[[Barefoot and Crazy]]\" by [[Jack Ingram]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.couleenews.com/articles/2009/08/14/features/01akins.txt|title=For Rhett Akins, life is good|last=Erickson|first=Randy|date=2009-08-14|work=Coulee News|access-date=2009-08-21}}</ref> \"[[Gimmie That Girl]]\" and \"[[The Shape I'm In (Joe Nichols song)|The Shape I'm In]]\" by [[Joe Nichols]], \"[[All About Tonight (Blake Shelton song)|All About Tonight]]\", \"[[Honey Bee (Blake Shelton song)|Honey Bee]]\", \"[[I Lived It]]\", and \"[[Boys 'Round Here]]\" by [[Blake Shelton]], \"[[When She Says Baby]]\", \"[[Just Gettin' Started]]\", \"[[Tonight Looks Good on You]]\" by [[Jason Aldean]], \"[[All Over Me (Josh Turner song)|All Over Me]]\" by [[Josh Turner]], \"Hot Mess\" by [[Tyler Farr]], \"[[Farmer's Daughter (Rodney Atkins song)|Farmer's Daughter]]\" and \"[[Take a Back Road (song)|Take a Back Road]]\" by [[Rodney Atkins]], \"[[Bait a Hook]]\" and \"[[Point at You]]\" by [[Justin Moore]], \"[[I Can Take It from There]]\" by [[Chris Young (singer)|Chris Young]], \"[[I Know Somebody]]\" by [[LoCash]], \"[[Parking Lot Party]]\", \"[[That Don't Sound Like You]]\" by [[Lee Brice]], \"[[Hey Girl (Billy Currington song)|Hey Girl]]\" by [[Billy Currington]], \"[[I Don't Want This Night to End]]\", \"[[Huntin', Fishin' and Lovin' Every Day]]\" by [[Luke Bryan]], \"[[Wild in Your Smile]]\", \"[[Mind Reader (Dustin Lynch song)|Mind Reader]]\", \"[[Small Town Boy (song)|Small Town Boy]]\" by [[Dustin Lynch]], \"[[It Goes Like This (song)|It Goes Like This]]\", \"[[Get Me Some of That]]\" and \"[[Star of the Show]]\" by [[Thomas Rhett]], \"Granddaddy's Gun\" by [[Aaron Lewis (musician)|Aaron Lewis]] and \"[[A Buncha Girls]]\", \"[[Young & Crazy (Frankie Ballard song)|Young & Crazy]]\" by [[Frankie Ballard]], \"[[Kick It in the Sticks]]\", \"[[Small Town Throwdown]]\" by [[Brantley Gilbert]]., \"[[Ready Set Roll]]\" by [[Chase Rice]], \"[[Dirt on My Boots]]\" by [[Jon Pardi]], “[[To Be Loved by You (Parker McCollum song)|To Be Loved By You]]” by [[Parker McCollum]] and \"Missing\" by [[William Michael Morgan]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/files/pdfs/country_update_1121.pdf |title=Archived copy |website=www.billboard.com |access-date=15 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202222613/http://www.billboard.com/files/pdfs/country_update_1121.pdf |archive-date=2 December 2016 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nAkins married Paige Braswell in 1989, but they have since divorced.
