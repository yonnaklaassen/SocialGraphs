He got his start in show business on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]].\n\n==Early career==\n[[File:Shadows of Tombstone movie poster 1953.JPG|thumb|Poster for ''Shadows of Tombstone'', 1953]]\nAllen began his singing career on radio station [[KOY]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona]], after which he became better known as a performer on the ''[[National Barn Dance]]'' on [[WLS (AM)|WLS]] in Chicago.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Luptak |first1=Gene |title=Communities to spotlight favorite sons |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/54737479/arizona-republic/ |access-date=July 5, 2020 |work=Arizona Republic |date=September 30, 1983 |location=Phoenix |page=81|via = [[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref>\n\nWhen [[singing cowboy]]s such as [[Roy Rogers]] and [[Gene Autry]] were very much in vogue in American film, in 1949 [[Republic Pictures]] in Hollywood gave him a screen test and put him under contract.<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> Beginning in 1950, Allen starred as himself in 19 of Hollywood's [[Western movie]]s.<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> One of the top-ten box office draws of the day, whose character was soon depicted in comic books,<ref>[https://www.comics.org/series/name/Rex%20Allen/sort/chrono/ Grand Comics Database: 'Rex Allen']</ref> on screen Allen personified the clean cut, God-fearing American hero of the [[Wild West]], who wore a white Stetson hat, loved his faithful horse Koko, and had a loyal buddy who shared his adventures. Allen's comic-relief sidekick in his first few pictures was first [[Buddy Ebsen]] and then [[character actor]] [[Slim Pickens]].<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/>\n\n==Personal life==\nIn 1940, Allen married Doris Windsor, with whom he had one child (Rexine Allen). His second marriage was to Bonnie Linder (m. 1946–1973), with whom he had four children. His third and final marriage was to Virginia Hudson, on November 25, 1992.

But he starred in a number of B-Westerns during the 1950s.<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/>\n\nAs other cowboy stars made the transition to television, Allen tried too, cast as Dr. Bill Baxter for the half-hour weekly syndicated series ''[[Frontier Doctor]]''.<ref name=\"etvs\">{{cite book|last1=Terrace|first1=Vincent|title=Encyclopedia of Television Shows, 1925 through 2010|date=2011|publisher=McFarland & Company, Inc., Publishers|location=Jefferson, N.C.|isbn=978-0786464777|page=370|edition=2nd}}</ref> In 1961, he was one of five rotating hosts for NBC-TV's ''[[Five Star Jubilee]]''.\n\nAllen had a rich, pleasant voice, ideally suited for narration, and was able to find considerable work as a narrator in a variety of films, especially for [[Walt Disney Pictures]] wildlife films and television shows.<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> The work earned him the nickname, \"The Voice of the West.\" He narrated ''[[The Legend of Lobo]]'', ''[[The Incredible Journey (film)|The Incredible Journey]]'', ''Yellowstone Cubs'', ''Run, Appaloosa, Run'', and [[Charlie, the Lonesome Cougar]]. He also was the voice of the father on [[Walt Disney's Carousel of Progress]], first presented at the [[1964 World's Fair]] and now at [[Walt Disney World]]. A 1993 renovation replaced Allen with [[Jean Shepherd]] as the voice of the father, but Allen was given a cameo as the grandfather in the final scene.\n\nAllen provided the narration for the 1973 [[Hanna-Barbera]] animated film ''[[Charlotte's Web (1973 film)|Charlotte's Web]]''.<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/>  He was also the voice behind Purina Dog Chow commercials for many years.  After moving to [[Sonoita, Arizona]], in the early 1990s, he was a viable voice talent almost until his death, recording hundreds of national advertising voice tracks at his favorite Tucson studio, Porter Sound.
