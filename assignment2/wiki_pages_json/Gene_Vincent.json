His 1956 top ten hit with his backing band [[the Blue Caps]], \"[[Be-Bop-a-Lula]]\", is considered a significant early example of rockabilly.<ref name=pc8/> His chart career was brief, especially in his home country of the US, where he notched three top 40 hits in 1956 and 1957, and never charted in the top 100 again.  In the UK, he was a somewhat bigger star, racking up eight top 40 hits from 1956 to 1961.\n\nVincent was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] and the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]]. He is sometimes referred to by his somewhat unusual nickname/moniker the \"Screaming End\".<ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-10-12 |title=Gene Vincent: The hero before The Beatles |url=https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/gene-vincent-heror-the-beatles/ |access-date=2022-05-27 |website=faroutmagazine.co.uk |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vivelerock.net/gene-vincent/|title=GENE VINCENT|first=Ian|last=Chaddock|website=Vivelerock.net|access-date=May 22, 2021|archive-date=December 28, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211228151827/https://vivelerock.net/gene-vincent/|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nCraddock was born February 11, 1935, in [[Norfolk, Virginia]],<ref name=\"Larkin\">{{cite book |title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]] |date=1997 |publisher=[[Virgin Books]] |isbn=1-85227-745-9 |editor=Colin Larkin |editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer) |edition=Concise |page=1218}}</ref> to Mary Louise and Ezekiah Jackson Craddock.<ref name=\"musicianguide.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://musicianguide.com/biographies/1608000576/Gene-Vincent.html|title=Gene Vincent Biography|website=Musicianguide.com|access-date=May 22, 2021}}</ref>  His musical influences included [[country music|country]], [[rhythm and blues]], and [[gospel music|gospel]]. His favorite composition was [[Egmont (Beethoven)|Beethoven's Egmont overture]]. He showed his first real interest in music while his family lived in Munden Point (now [[Virginia Beach]]), in [[Princess Anne County, Virginia|Princess Anne County]], Virginia, near the [[North Carolina]] line, where they ran a country store. He received his first guitar at the age of twelve as a gift from a friend.\n\nCraddock's father volunteered to serve in the [[United States Coast Guard|U.S. Coast Guard]] and patrolled American coastal waters to protect Allied shipping against German [[U-boat]]s during [[World War II]]. Craddock's mother maintained the general store in Munden Point. His parents moved the family to Norfolk, the home of a large naval base, and opened a general store and sailors' tailoring shop.\n\nCraddock dropped out of school in 1952, at the age of seventeen, and enlisted in the [[United States Navy]]. As he was under the age of enlistment, his parents signed the forms allowing him to enter. He completed boot camp and joined the fleet as a crewman aboard the fleet oiler {{USS|Chukawan|AO-100|6}}, with a two-week training period in the repair ship {{USS|Amphion|AR-13|6}}, before returning to the ''Chukawan''. He never saw combat but completed a [[Korean War]] deployment. He sailed home from Korean waters aboard the battleship {{USS|Wisconsin|BB-64|6}} but was not part of the ship's company.\n\nCraddock planned a career in the Navy and, in 1955, used his $612 re-enlistment bonus to buy a new [[Triumph Engineering|Triumph]] motorcycle.
