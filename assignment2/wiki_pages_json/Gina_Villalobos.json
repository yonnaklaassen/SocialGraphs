From 1992 thorough 2013, she extensively toured and recorded in the United States, the UK and Europe, writing songs and making music in bands and as a solo artist. Counting her most recent release, ''Sola'' (2014), Villalobos has released five solo studio albums. She continues to sing and compose in her work as a music creator at ''Feverpitch'', where she services the motion picture industry, specifically those companies making movie [[trailer music]]. She creates sound effects, produces music, and composes original scores.\n\n== Early life ==\nVillalobos spent her childhood in the [[Santa Monica]] Mountain community of Lake Sherwood, California. By way of inspiration, Gina's mother handed down her passion for music, while her father [[Reynaldo Villalobos]] is an acclaimed [[cinematographer]] and director.<ref name=\"dostuff\" /> By the time she was seven, Villalobos was teaching herself guitar, and began her music career at the end of college.\n\n== Musical career ==\nIn her early 20s, Villalobos fronted and played guitar in the acoustic folk trio Liquid Sunshine. Together, they recorded the albums ''Sweet Commitment'' and ''Barbary Lane'', as well as the self-titled ''Liquid Sunshine EP'' before disbanding in 1996. Between 1997 and 2001, Villalobos fronted the band The Mades, with whom she recorded two albums, before starting her solo career with 2002's ''Beg From Me''.<ref name=\"dostuff\" />\n\nIn 2004, she caught the attention of respected U.S. publications like ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'', ''[[No Depression (magazine)|No Depression]]'', ''[[Acoustic Guitar (magazine)|Acoustic Guitar]]'', and ''[[Harp (magazine)|Harp]]''.<ref>[http://ginavillalobos.bandzoogle.com/press/  Press quotes collection].</ref> In anticipation of her sophomore studio album, ''Live from [[KXLU]] Radio'' was released, containing a live recording with songs off the new album. With her second outing, ''Rock 'N' Roll Pony'', the European press and radio praised the CD, which reached No. 3 on the Euro-Americana charts, and by 2005, Villalobos was performing in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. She toured with [[Laura Veirs]]<ref>[http://lauraveirs.com/  Laura Veirs main page]</ref> in 2005 on her UK tour.  Her 2007 self-release ''Miles Away'' repeated her previous successes in the U.K. press and on [[BBC Radio 2]]. Around that time, the alternative rock band [[World Party]]<ref>[http://www.worldparty.net/  World Party Main Page]</ref> invited Villalobos to tour the States with them, and her songs started showing up in movies and TV shows like ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]'' and ''[[Army Wives]]''. Two years later, Gina delivered ''Days on Their Side''.\n\nVillalobos has been associated with [[Anne McCue]],<ref>[http://www.annemccue.com/ Anne McCue Main Page]</ref> and has been recognized for her contribution to California songs.\n\nIn 2014, after an extended hiatus and having taken the time to produce the album since January 2012,<ref name=\"dostuff\" /> ''Sola'' was released. She produced and Erik Colvin engineered, as he's done for each of her previous three offerings. Augmenting Gina's vocals and guitar are guitarist Kevin Haaland ([[Andy Grammer]]), back for his fourth Gina Villalobos album, and returning guitarist Josh Grange ([[Sheryl Crow]], [[k.d. lang]], [[Beck]], [[Dixie Chicks]]); Also credited are Eric Heywood ([[Son Volt]], [[Ray LaMontagne]], [[The Pretenders]], [[Alejandro Escovedo]]) on pedal steel. Upright bass was performed by Ian Walker (k.d. lang, [[Cher]], [[Paula Cole]], [[The Ditty Bops]]). Quinn ([[Tracy Chapman]], [[Daft Punk]], [[Paula Cole]]) was the drummer.\n\nIn late 2015, The [[Golden Globe Award]] and [[Emmy Award]]-winning [[Amazon Studios]] TV show, ''[[Transparent (TV series)|Transparent]]''<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3502262/ Transparent IMDB link]</ref> selected the arrangement featuring the \nGina Villalobos/Eric Colvin produced version<ref>[https://ginavillalobos.bandcamp.com/track/family-affair-derivative-work Family Affair stream on Bandcamp]</ref> of the 1971 [[Sly and the Family Stone]] hit \"[[Family Affair (Sly and the Family Stone song)|Family Affair]]\" featuring the vocals of [[Ruby Friedman]] for use in the trailer promoting the launch of Season 2.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CluxHR9pkdQ Official Amazon Studio Transparent Season 2 Trailer]</ref>\n\n== Discography ==\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!
