It’s country, R&B, bluegrass rock with Beachboys overtones. Some of the most interesting stuff they do is electric bluegrass tunes like Bill Monroe’s Uncle Pen, even with Tom Hamilton playing five string banjo, it still sounds like a dance record from Soul Train. What the Pulleybone does is hard to explain but it’s easy to enjoy.”''</blockquote>\n\nTennessee Pulleybone lasted from 1973 to 1979.<ref name=\"The Amplifier Online\"/> After disbanding, Wolters joined [[Dr. Hook & the Medicine Show]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Country music groups from Tennessee]]\n[[Category:RCA Records Nashville artists]]\n[[Category:Musical groups established in 1970]]\n[[Category:Musical groups disestablished in 1979]]"
