He has released eleven studio albums, one [[extended play]], six live albums, and 19 [[single (music)|singles]]. Although active since 1992, Ingram did not reach the U.S. Country Top 40 until the release of his single \"[[Wherever You Are (Jack Ingram song)|Wherever You Are]]\" late-2005. A number one hit on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country charts, that song was also his first release for Big Machine and that label's first Number One hit. Ingram has sent six other songs into the country Top 40 with \"[[Love You (song)|Love You]]\", \"[[Lips of an Angel]]\" (a [[cover version]] of a song by [[Hinder]]), \"[[Measure of a Man (Jack Ingram song)|Measure of a Man]]\", \"[[Maybe She'll Get Lonely]]\", \"[[That's a Man]]\", and \"[[Barefoot and Crazy]]\".\n\n==Biography==\nIngram was born in [[Houston|Houston, Texas]]. He started writing songs and performing while studying [[psychology]] at [[Southern Methodist University]] in [[Dallas]], where he was member of [[Alpha Tau Omega]].\n\n===Musical career===\nJack Ingram began his music career singing at a privately owned bar near the TCU campus of Fort Worth, Texas, which was owned by his friend [[John Clay Wolfe]].\nLater, during the early 1990s, Jack toured the state of Texas opening for [[Mark Chesnutt]] and other acts.<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p89255|pure_url=yes}}|title=Jack Ingram biography|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|work=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=May 28, 2009}}</ref> His first release was his self-titled album in 1995 via the Rhythmic label, followed by 1995's ''Lonesome Questions''. [[Warner Records|Warner Bros. Records]] eventually signed him and released a live album entitled ''Live at Adair's'', and re-issued his first two indie albums.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/>\n\nIn 1997 he had his first time on the 22nd season of [[Austin City Limits]]. That same year, he released ''[[Livin' or Dyin']]'' via [[Rising Tide Records]], which produced his first chart single in the No.&nbsp;51-peaking \"Flutter\". Two years later came ''Hey You'' via Lucky Dog, a division of [[Epic Records]], which accounted for a No.&nbsp;64 country single in \"How Many Days\". In 2000, he collaborated with [[Charlie Robison]] and [[Bruce Robison]] for the live album ''Unleashed Live''.\n\n''[[Electric (Jack Ingram album)|Electric]]'', his second album for Lucky Dog, was also his first album to enter [[Top Country Albums]], despite not producing a chart single. This album was supplemented a year later by an [[extended play|EP]] entitled ''Electric: Extra Volts'' before he left Lucky Dog. Two more live albums followed before he signed to [[Sony Music Nashville|Columbia Nashville]] for the release of ''Young Man'' in 2004, which accounted for no singles. Another live album, ''Acoustic Motel'', was issued in 2005.\n\nOn Sunday, February 3, 2013, [[H-E-B]] premiered their 'Texas Myths' Super Bowl commercial featuring Jack Ingram.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLcSPOZoBPw|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130206002258/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLcSPOZoBPw|url-status=dead|archive-date=2013-02-06|title=H-E-B 2013 Game Day Commercial: Texas Myths - YouTube|website = [[YouTube]]|date=February 6, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===2005–2011: Big Machine Records===\nIn 2005, Ingram signed to the independent record label [[Big Machine Records]]. Under the Big Machine banner, Ingram released a predominantly live album entitled ''[[Live: Wherever You Are]]''. His first single release on that record label, \"[[Wherever You Are (Jack Ingram song)|Wherever You Are]]\", became Ingram's first top 40, and later his first and only Number One single on the U.S. ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts, as well as the first Number One for the Big Machine label. \"[[Love You (song)|Love You]]\", the only other studio track on ''Live: Wherever You Are'', was also released as a single, peaking at No.&nbsp;12 on the charts. This song was also recorded by [[Trent Summar & the New Row Mob]] (whose frontman, Trent Summar, co-wrote it) on their 2005 album ''Horseshoes & Hand Grenades''.\n\nIn late 2006, Ingram released a cover of [[Hinder]]'s song \"[[Lips of an Angel]]\". Ingram's cover peaked at No.&nbsp;16 on the country charts \"Lips of an Angel\" was the lead-off single to ''This Is It'', his second album for Big Machine. This album also produced the No.&nbsp;18 \"[[Measure of a Man (Jack Ingram song)|Measure of a Man]]\" (a [[Radney Foster]] co-write) and the No.&nbsp;24 \"[[Maybe She'll Get Lonely]]\".\n\nIn 2008, Ingram appeared at the Argyle Education Foundation Black Diamond Affair.\n\nHe won the [[Academy of Country Music]] award for top new male vocalist on May 19, 2008. Ingram also filled in for radio host [[Bob Kingsley]] on the countdown show \"[[Bob Kingsley's Country Top 40]]\" for the week of September 20–21, 2008.\n\nAccording to [[CMT (American TV channel)|CMT]], Ingram's ''Big Dreams & High Hopes'' album has \"more guts\" and [[Ellis Paul]]'s \"The World Ain't Slowing Down\" may be the song that takes Ingram to the \"next level\".<ref>Shelburne, Craig.
