The song reached the Country Top 40. In 1980 she released another single, \"It Don't Hurt to Dream\". The record rose a little higher, to number 35. That same year, she finally made it to the Top 10 with \"Tumbleweed\".<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> In 1981, her song \"Drifter\" hit number 1 on the country charts, and two other songs, \"The Matador\" and \"Heart on the Mend\" landed in the Top 10.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> \"The Matador\" was country music's first conceptual music video to air on CMT. ''[[Drifter (Sylvia album)|Drifter]]'' was her 1981 RCA debut studio album, containing the hits \"Tumbleweed\" and \"Heart On The Mend\".<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/>\n\n===Chart hits in the 1980s===\nIn 1982, from her ''[[Just Sylvia]]'' studio album, Sylvia released the single \"Nobody\", which reached number 1 on the country music chart, hit number 15 on ''Billboard''{{'}}s Hot 100 chart,<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> and sold more than a million copies. The song was also an [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]] hit, making the Top 5. \"Nobody\" became Sylvia's [[signature song]].\n\n\"Nobody\" and the album ''Just Sylvia'' were certified gold in the United States and Canada. \"Nobody\" was the 1982 [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]] Song of the Year, awarded for receiving more radio airplay than any other single that year. In 1982, Sylvia was the Academy of Country Music's \"Female Vocalist of the Year\" and a Grammy nominee for \"Best Female Vocalist\".\n\nIn 1983, Sylvia's album ''Snapshot'' was released;<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> its title song climbed to number 5 on the country chart and became her second-highest selling single.

Three singles were released: \"[[Fallin' in Love (Sylvia song)|Fallin' in Love]]\", \"[[Cry Just a Little Bit]]\", and \"[[I Love You By Heart]].\" This was followed up by Sylvia's last top 40 country hit, \"Nothin' Ventured, Nothin' Gained\", from the unreleased album ''Knockin Around''. The shelving of this album marked the end of Sylvia's tenure with RCA Records. Sylvia recorded for RCA until the end of 1987, delivering 11 Top Ten songs, and selling more than four million records.\n\nRCA put together a ''Greatest Hits'' compilation and issued a new single titled \"Straight from My Heart\", written with Jimmy Fortune of [[the Statler Brothers]]. With little promotion from RCA, the single charted in the low 60s.\n\n===Later career===\nWhen her contract with RCA ended, Sylvia took a break from touring and recording to focus on developing as a songwriter. In 1988 and 1989, she guest-hosted [[The Nashville Network|TNN]]'s ''[[Crook and Chase]]'' show and her own ''Holiday Gourmet'' cooking special.\n\nSylvia's first independent album, ''The Real Story'', was released in 1996 on her own label, Red Pony Records. In a May 1998 ''People'' magazine review, Ralph Novak wrote, \"Sylvia always sang with more intensity and resonance than most country singers... and she can still sing a story song better than almost anyone around.\"\n\nIn 2002, she followed with ''Where in the World'', a set that marked the culmination of an 11-year musical collaboration with [[John Mock]]. Songwriter Craig Bickhardt contributed the song \"Crazy Nightingale\". Bickhardt had previously performed with Sylvia from 1984, and wrote the title cut to ''One Step Closer''. Also in 2002, Sylvia released, ''A Cradle in Bethlehem'', her first Christmas album.\n\nIn 2016, the album, ''It's All in the Family'', was released on Red Pony Records.\n\nIn 2018, Sylvia released, ''Second Bloom: The Hits Re-Imagined'', an album of some of her hits she re-recorded with a more acoustic yet fully produced approach.\n\nIn 2022, Sylvia's newest album, ''Nature Child&mdash;A Dreamer's Journey'', was released on February 22, 2022.\n\nStill residing in the Nashville area, Sylvia is now a life coach for up & coming individuals working in the music industry – singers, songwriters, musicians, recording artists, and music industry professionals.  She also coaches people who work at non-profit agencies. <ref>https://mycountry955.com/whatever-happened-to-sylvia/?utm_source=tsmclip&utm_medium=referral</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n{{Main|Sylvia discography}}\n\n==Awards and honors==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border-width:1px; width:100%;\"\n|-\n!
