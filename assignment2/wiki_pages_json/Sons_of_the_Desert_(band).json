Its most famous lineup consisted of brothers Drew Womack (lead vocals) and Tim Womack (lead guitar, background vocals), along with Scott Saunders (keyboards), Doug Virden (bass guitar, background vocals), and Brian Westrum (drums). The band released ''[[Whatever Comes First]]'' for [[Epic Records]] Nashville in 1997, and recorded a second album for Epic which was not released. ''[[Change (Sons of the Desert album)|Change]]'' followed in 2000. Counting two singles from the unreleased album, Sons of the Desert charted eight times on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]], including the top ten hit \"[[Whatever Comes First (song)|Whatever Comes First]]\"; they were also guest vocalists on [[Lee Ann Womack]]'s 2000 hit \"[[I Hope You Dance]]\" and [[Ty Herndon]]'s \"[[It Must Be Love (Ty Herndon song)|It Must Be Love]]\", both of which reached No.&nbsp;1 on that chart. Following the band's disestablishment, Drew Womack became a solo artist; he would join [[Lonestar]] in 2021.\n\n==Biography==\nThe band, deriving its name from the 1933 [[Laurel and Hardy]] film ''[[Sons of the Desert (film)|Sons of the Desert]]'', was founded in 1989 by a group of students attending [[McLennan Community College]] in [[Waco, Texas]].<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p210532/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Sons of the Desert biography |accessdate=2007-07-15 |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |authorlink=Stephen Thomas Erlewine |work=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> The original members included Doug Virden, [[Jim Beavers]], Troy Von Haefen, Kyle Mathis, and Curtis Beck.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/42816987/ | title=College grad devotes more time to band, singing | work=The Waco Citizen | date=July 24, 1990 | accessdate=April 3, 2019 | pages=3}}</ref> By 1994, the lineup had consisted of Doug Virden, Scott Saunders, Drew Womack, Brian Westrum, and guitarist [[Mark Matejka]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/788813371 | title=Native son returning to sing | work=San Angelo Standard-Times | date=August 16, 1994 | accessdate=June 10, 2023 | author=Jenny Strasburg | pages=6A, 9A}}</ref>\n\n==First album==\nIn 1997, Sons of the Desert signed to [[Epic Records]]' Nashville division. By this point, Drew's brother Tim had replaced Matejka as well. The band's debut album, ''[[Whatever Comes First]]'', was released that year. Its [[Whatever Comes First (song)|title track]] served as the lead-off single, reaching a peak of No.&nbsp;10 on ''Billboard'' Hot Country Singles & Tracks.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/><ref name=\"whitburn\">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2008|publisher=Record Research, Inc|year=2008|page=393|isbn=978-0-89820-177-2}}</ref> The album's second and third singles, \"Hand of Fate\" and \"Leaving October\" (which Drew Womack wrote about his third-grade teacher<ref name=\"october\"/>), also reached top 40 on the same chart. Drew Womack and Virden also appeared as studio [[backing vocalist]]s for other Epic Records artists, including [[Ty Herndon]]'s 1996 album ''[[Living in a Moment]]'' and 1998 album ''[[Big Hopes]]'', as well as [[Joe Diffie]]'s 1997 album ''[[Twice Upon a Time (Joe Diffie album)|Twice Upon a Time]]''. Drew Womack also wrote [[Kenny Chesney]]'s 1997 single \"[[She's Got It All]]\".<ref name=\"mtv\"/>\n\n==\"Goodbye Earl\"==\nFollowing the release of its first album, Sons of the Desert discovered a song called \"[[Goodbye Earl]]\", which they began to perform in concert.

Shortly thereafter, the [[Dixie Chicks]] (who were signed to [[Monument Records]], which like Epic, was a division of [[Sony Music Entertainment]]), recorded the song, and they were planning to include it on their next album as well. Although both bands had planned to release their versions as singles, the Dixie Chicks claimed the song as their own. Their version was on their 1999 album ''[[Fly (Dixie Chicks album)|Fly]]'', and released as a single in 2000.<ref name=\"find\"/>\n\nSons of the Desert then entered a dispute with Sony over \"Goodbye Earl\", resulting in the band's departure from the label.<ref name=\"cmt\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1472617/06122003/sons_of_the_desert.jhtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040611162530/http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1472617/06122003/sons_of_the_desert.jhtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 11, 2004 |title=Sons of the Desert Find a Change: MCA Debut Puts Band Back in Record Stores, on Tour With Dwight Yoakam |accessdate=2007-07-15 |last=Young |first=Lisa |date=2000-06-28 |work=[[Country Music Television|CMT.com]]}}</ref><ref name=\"mtv\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1021387/sons-of-the-desert-make-change-after-song-dispute/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171225091832/http://www.mtv.com/news/1021387/sons-of-the-desert-make-change-after-song-dispute/|url-status=dead|archive-date=December 25, 2017|title=SONS OF THE DESERT MAKE CHANGE AFTER SONG DISPUTE|last=Schmitzer|first=Lauren|date=June 14, 2000|work=MTV|accessdate=4 June 2017}}</ref> Their second album for Epic was not released, and Sony acquired the rights to all of that album's songs (including the single \"What About You\", which had been released and peaked at number 45 on the country chart).<ref name=\"cmt\"/> Also included on this unreleased album was a recording of \"[[Bless the Broken Road]]\", a song which was previously a number 42 country single in 1997 for [[Melodie Crittenden]], and would later become a No.&nbsp;1 country hit when the group [[Rascal Flatts]] recorded it for their 2004 album ''[[Feels Like Today]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://countrymusic.about.com/od/songwriters/a/sng_mhummon.htm |title=Matt's Songwriter Spotlight - Marcus Hummon |accessdate=2008-04-01 |last=Bjorke |first=Matt |work=[[About.com]] |archive-date=2008-05-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080508140954/http://countrymusic.about.com/od/songwriters/a/sng_mhummon.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref> \"Albuquerque\" was issued as the unreleased album's second single, peaking at No.&nbsp;58.
