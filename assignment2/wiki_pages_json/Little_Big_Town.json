Founded in 1998, the group has had the same four members since its founding: Karen Fairchild, Kimberly Schlapman (née Roads), Phillip Sweet, and Jimi Westbrook. Their musical style relies heavily on four-part vocal harmonies, with all four members alternating as lead vocalists. Fairchild and Westbrook have been married to each other since 2006.\n\nAfter a recording deal with the [[Mercury Nashville Records]] label which produced no singles or albums, Little Big Town released its [[Little Big Town (album)|self-titled debut]] on [[Monument Records]] in 2002. It produced two minor country chart singles before the group left the label. In 2005, the group signed to [[Equity Music Group]], an independent record label owned by [[Clint Black]]. Their second album, ''[[The Road to Here]]'', was released that year, and received a [[RIAA certification|platinum certification]] from the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). ''[[A Place to Land (Little Big Town album)|A Place to Land]]'', their third album, was released via Equity, then re-released via [[Capitol Records Nashville|Capitol Nashville]] after Equity closed in 2008. Six more albums followed for Capitol: ''[[The Reason Why]]'' (2010), ''[[Tornado (Little Big Town album)|Tornado]]'' (2012),  ''[[Pain Killer (Little Big Town album)|Pain Killer]]'' (2014), ''[[The Breaker (Little Big Town album)|The Breaker]]'' (2017), ''[[Nightfall (Little Big Town album)|Nightfall]]'' (2020) and ''[[Mr. Sun]]'' (2022), four of which have reached number one on the [[Top Country Albums]] chart.\n\nTheir albums accounted for 24 singles on [[Hot Country Songs]] and [[Country Airplay]], including the No.&nbsp;1 singles \"[[Pontoon (song)|Pontoon]]\", and \"[[Better Man (Little Big Town song)|Better Man]]\" along with the top 10 hits \"[[Boondocks (song)|Boondocks]]\", \"[[Bring It On Home (Little Big Town song)|Bring It On Home]]\", \"[[Little White Church]]\", \"[[Tornado (song)|Tornado]]\", \"[[Day Drinking]]\", and \"[[Girl Crush]]\".\n\n==Early years==\nFairchild and Schlapman met at [[Samford University]] in 1987, where they both sang in the school's vocal ensembles.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.samford.edu/news/2007/Little-Big-Town-To-Perform-at-Homecoming|title=Little Big Town To Perform at Homecoming|website=Samford.edu|access-date=December 21, 2020}}</ref> In the mid-1990s, Fairchild sang with the Christian vocal group [[Truth (American band)|Truth]] and was featured as a lead singer in a few of their songs.
