In an interview with the ''Nashville City Paper'', Thile described the formation of the band:\n\n{{quote|We got together one night just to drop a ton of money, drink too much wine, eat steaks, and commiserate about our failed relationships. We had gotten to play together a few days before and we had said that we needed to do something musical together. With our hearts smashed to pieces, it became more urgent — our lives had gone the same way for so long. I knew I wanted to have a band with Gabe [Witcher], but I didn’t know if it would be a rock ensemble, an ambitious acoustic classical thing or a bluegrass group. We played, and there was a serious, instantaneous connection. Then I knew I wanted to put together a bluegrass band — one with a lot of range, but aesthetically a bluegrass band.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://nashvillecitypaper.com/index.cfm?section=12&screen=news&news_id=51705  | title = Nickel Creek's Thile 'grows' a new band | newspaper = Nashville City Paper | date = 2006-08-23 | access-date = 2007-10-13 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060826212803/http://nashvillecitypaper.com/index.cfm?section=12&screen=news&news_id=51705 |archive-date = 2006-08-26}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThe band was initially known as '''The How to Grow a Band'''. In 2007, they officially changed their name, first to '''The Tensions Mountain Boys''', before settling on Punch Brothers. The band's name comes from the critical line of an [[earworm]] [[A Literary Nightmare#The jingle|jingle]] that is the centerpiece of [[Mark Twain|Mark Twain's]] short story \"[[A Literary Nightmare]]\".<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.amazon.com/Punch-Brothers/dp/B0010YO8M6 | title = Punch Brothers: Punch | website = Amazon | access-date = 2010-04-23}}</ref> The chorus of the jingle consists of two lines, \"Punch, brothers! punch with care! Punch in the presence of the passenjare,\" which are said to be the mantra of railroad conductors.\n\nWhat they formed was a type of group that ''[[American Songwriter]]'' magazine calls \"A 21st century version of the [[Bill Monroe|Bluegrass Boys]].\"<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.americansongwriter.com/2012/05/punch-brothers-american-pickers/ | title = Punch Brothers: American Pickers|magazine=[[American Songwriter]]|access-date=31 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n===2007–2009: \"The Blind Leaving the Blind\" and ''Punch''===\n[[File:Chris Thile 2008 3.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Noam Pikelny (banjo), Chris Thile (mandolin), Greg Garrison (bass), and Chris Eldridge (guitar) at Wintergrass, 2008]]\nOn March 17, 2007, this group debuted the ambitious forty-minute suite, \"The Blind Leaving the Blind\" at Carnegie Hall. The piece was composed by Thile, who said he wrote it in part to deal with his divorce in 2003.\n\nOn February 13, 2008, the band set off on their first national tour as Punch Brothers. On February 26, they released ''[[Punch (album)|Punch]]'', their first album, on [[Nonesuch Records]]. The album features Thile's suite \"The Blind Leaving the Blind\", as well as other original songs.<ref>{{cite magazine | url = http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/news.php?id=15490 | title = Nonesuch Records Signs Singer/Composer/Mandolinist Chris Thile and His New Band, Punch Brothers | magazine = All About Jazz | date = 2007-10-09 | access-date = 2007-10-10 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071225112354/http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/news.php?id=15490 | archive-date = 2007-12-25 }}</ref>\n\nIn March 2008, when asked about a follow-up album, Thile said \"there will definitely be another album.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/music/articles/2008/04/05/now_out_of_the_creek_thiles_packing_punch/ |title=Now out of the Creek, Thile's packing Punch - The Boston Globe |publisher=Boston.com |date=2008-04-05 |access-date=2015-03-18}}</ref> On November 8, 2008, the band announced on their website that they had parted ways with bass player Greg Garrison.

It was filmed over a two-year period and, according to its website, \"explores the tensions between individual talents and group identity, art and commerce, youth and wisdom\". The film premiered at the 42nd [[Nashville Film Festival]] in Nashville, Tennessee on April 15, 2011. The film also screened as part of the 38th Annual [[Telluride Bluegrass Festival]] in June 2011.\n\n===2012: ''Who's Feeling Young Now?'' and ''Ahoy!''===\nThe band released its third album, ''[[Who's Feeling Young Now?]]'', in February 2012. Shortly afterwards, they contributed the song 'Dark Days' to the soundtrack for 2012 blockbuster ''[[The Hunger Games (film)|The Hunger Games]]''. In November 2012 they released ''Ahoy!'', the 5-track EP companion to ''Who's Feeling Young Now?'' The EP consists of five songs that were not featured on the full-length release.\n\n===2015: ''The Phosphorescent Blues'' and ''The Wireless''===\nIn November 2014, the band released the first single, entitled \"I Blew It Off,\" from their then-untitled fourth album.
