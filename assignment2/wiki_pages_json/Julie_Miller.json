She married [[Buddy Miller]] in 1981. They sing and play on each other's solo projects and have recorded several duet albums.\n\n==Career==\n\n===Recordings===\nJulie Miller's first professionally released recording was with the group ''Streetlight'' which consisted of Julie, [[Buddy Miller]], and Ron Krueger.  The self-titled album was released in 1983. Julie and Buddy wrote some songs for the LP, including the original version of \"Jesus in Your Eyes\" (later re-recorded for ''Orphans and Angels''). \"How Could You Say No\" (written by Mickey Cates) was originally performed on this album and later included on Julie's solo debut ''Meet Julie Miller''.\n\nA 1985 demo tape recorded by Julie listed eight songs, but contained eleven. Two of these songs were later included on ''Meet Julie Miller'', but the remaining nine songs were not reissued. Songs on this tape include: \"I Don't Need Anything Else\", \"Mystery Love\" (Synth Pop Version), \"Love Is\", \"I Look to You\", \"I Don't Need\", \"What Does it Take\", \"I Wanna Be Ready\", \"King of my Heart\" (not the same as that which appeared later on her first Myrrh release), \"My New Psychiatrist\" (Synth Pop Version with different lyrics), \"Debby Came Back\", \"Dangerous Place\" (Synth Pop Version). Only one copy of this tape has seen circulation; it is unknown whether Julie used the tape to shop for a record label, or sold them at concerts.\n\nJulie's musical career initially took off after singer [[Sam Phillips (singer)|Sam Phillips]] forwarded her demo tape to friends at [[Myrrh Records]]. Myrrh signed Miller to a contract and released ''Meet Julie Miller'' (her first solo album) in 1990. This album included backing vocals from [[Shawn Colvin]], [[Victoria Williams]], [[Amy Grant]], [[Kelly Willard]] and [[Russ Taff]].\n\nMiller's second solo album ''He Walks Through Walls'' (1991) also included backing vocals from Colvin, Williams, Grant and Willard. [[Mark Heard]] and Reverend Dan Smith also contributed vocals. This album included the original version of the song \"Broken Things\", which was later re-recorded. Her 1993 album ''Orphans and Angels'' included a duet with [[Emmylou Harris]] on \"All My Tears\", which was written after the death of Mark Heard. [[Jazz]] vocalist [[Jimmy Scott]] also contributed vocals. Miller also covered Heard's song \"Treasure of the Broken Land\". Shawn Colvin once again contributed background vocals.  The video of the song \"S.O.S.\" from this album was released to Christian TV.\n\nHer fourth solo album ''Invisible Girl'' was released by Street Level Records. Julie covered [[The Williams Brothers#Second generation|The Williams Brothers]] song \"[[Can't Cry Hard Enough]]\". Victoria Williams, [[Mark Olson (musician)|Mark Olson]] and [[the Electrics]] provided background vocals. In 1997, Julie Miller released ''[[Blue Pony]]'' ([[Hightone Records]]) which includes contributions from [[Emmylou Harris]], [[Buddy Miller]], and [[Valerie Carter]]. Her most recent solo album is ''Broken Things'' in 1999, which includes new versions of \"Broken Things\" and \"All My Tears\" as well as new songs \"I Know Why The River Runs,\" \"Orphan Train,\" \"Out in the Rain\" and \"I Still Cry.\" The song \"By way of Sorrow\" was a duet with [[Innocence Mission]]'s Karen Peris.\n\nIn 2001, the first Buddy and Julie Miller duo album ''[[Buddy & Julie Miller]]'' was released in 2001. This album won the Americana Music Association award for best album in 2002. Released in 2002, ''Love Snuck Up'' was a compilation of the Millers' Hightone recordings. A Julie Miller compilation is planned, which will include tracks selected by Julie from her first four albums, which have been out of print for many years.\n\n===Work with other artists===\n\nIn 1987 Julie contributed background vocals to the song \"Remember Me\" on [[Benny Hester]]'s album ''Through the Window''. In 1992, Julie provided the title track for ''Cry of the Heart: Emily's Eyes'', an album released to bring hope to victims of child abuse. Julie mentioned after a 2002 concert in Kentucky that the song \"Emily's Eyes\" had one line edited out of it, as there was concern regarding the \"implications\". No further details were provided.\n\nIn 1994, Julie and Buddy Miller recorded Mark Heard's \"Orphans of God\" which was the title track for the single CD Mark Heard Tribute album [[Strong Hand of Love]].<ref name=JM-syndicate-1994>{{cite news|last1=Newcomb|first1=Brian|title=Review: 'Strong Hand of Love: A tribute to Mark Heard'|url=http://www.markheard.net/reviews/strong_hand_of_love_review.html|access-date=April 10, 2017|work=Syndicate |date=July 1, 1994}}</ref> They also assisted Victoria Williams on her version of \"What Kind of Friend\".
