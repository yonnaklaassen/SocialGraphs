They released their self-titled debut album in 2002, followed by the Carnival records release ''Level'' in 2005. Their third album, ''[[Jet Black & Jealous]]'', was released in 2008 by [[Universal South Records]]. A second major-label album, ''[[Life at Best]]'', was released in 2011 by [[Republic Nashville]], with ''[[10,000 Towns]]'' following in early 2014. The band has charted eight times on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country charts, with four of their singles having reached No. 1: \"[[Crazy Girl]]\", which was the top country song of 2011 according to [[Billboard Year-End|''Billboard'' Year-End]], along with \"[[Even If It Breaks Your Heart]]\", \"[[Drunk Last Night]]\", and \"[[Love Ain't]]\".\n\n==Biography==\nMike Eli and James Young met at the [[University of North Texas]] where they became dorm roommates their freshman year.
