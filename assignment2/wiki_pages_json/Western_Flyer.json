Completing the lineup were harmonicist/mandolinist T.J. Klay, drummer Bruce Gust, lead guitarist Steve Charles, and guitarist/banjoist Roger Helton. The band members met in Nashville at a church where some of them had been playing in the church band.  The band took the name Western Flyer from a brand of bicycle.<ref name=\"whitburn\">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2008|publisher=Record Research, Inc|year=2008|page=456|isbn=978-0-89820-177-2}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Rush |first=Diane Samms |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=qbwwAAAAIBAJ&pg=6755%2C4222623 |title=Western Flyer's in gear |work=[[Lakeland Ledger]] |date=November 27, 1994 |page=6C |accessdate=2015-08-30 }}</ref>\n\nThe group signed to the independent Step One Records label in 1993, and released a self-titled debut album a year later.
