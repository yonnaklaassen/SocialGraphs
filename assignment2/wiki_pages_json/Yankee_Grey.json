The same year, they made their debut on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country music charts with the Top Ten single \"All Things Considered,\" followed by the release of their debut album ''Untamed'', which produced two more hit singles on the country charts. After exiting Monument, the band signed to the independent Stonewall label in 2002.\n\n==Biography==\nYankee Grey was founded in Cincinnati in 1986 by drummer Kevin Griffin and guitarist Matthew Basford, steel guitarist David Carter, lead vocals and guitarist Coy Lee Jackson, and Bass Guitarist Dwayne Blankenship.<ref name=\"music\">{{cite web |url=http://www.musiccity.com/artists/yankee_grey.html |title=Artists: Yankee Grey |access-date=2008-01-04 |work=Music City.com}}</ref> Bass guitarist David Buchanan and lead vocalist Tim Hunt were added soon afterward, and the group began to perform in various bars and clubs around Cincinnati.<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p375492/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Yankee Grey biography |access-date=2008-01-04 |last=Ruhlmann |first=William |work=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> Eventually, keyboardist Jerry Hughes and fiddle player Joe Caverlee were added as well, completing the band's lineup. After several years of playing local venues in Ohio, Yankee Grey was eventually spotted by an engineer who had connections to [[Nashville, Tennessee]] record producers. He then asked the band to record a demo tape; Cliff Audretch, Senior Director of Sony Music Nashville, heard the demo tape and traveled to Ohio to see them perform.\n\nBy 1997, the group was signed to Sony's [[Monument Records]] division. Their debut album ''Untamed'' was issued in late 1999, with [[Robert Ellis Orrall]], [[Josh Leo]], and Ronnie Thomas serving as producers. \"All Things Considered,\" the first release from the album, reached a peak of No.&nbsp;8 on the ''Billboard'' Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now [[Hot Country Songs]]) charts.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> In addition, Yankee Grey received a nomination for Best New Group or Duo at the [[Academy of Country Music]] awards that year.<ref name=\"cmt\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1476415/20030811/yankee_grey.jhtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930055927/http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1476415/20030811/yankee_grey.jhtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 30, 2007 |title=Yankee Grey loses lead singer |access-date=2008-01-04 |date=2000-09-30 |work=[[Country Music Television]]}} [broken link as of June 6, 2013]</ref>\n\nThe second single from ''Untamed'', \"Another Nine Minutes,\" peaked at No.&nbsp;15 on the country charts in 2000; it was followed by \"This Time Around,\" which failed to enter the Top 40. By the end of 2000, Yankee Grey had exited Monument's roster, and Tim Hunt had left the group's lineup due to vocal problems.<ref name=\"cmt\"/> After Hunt's departure, the band began a search for a replacement lead singer.<ref name=\"cmt\"/>\n\nThe group signed to an independent label known as Stonewall Records. Their second album, ''Yankee Grey 2'', was issued in 2002, with keyboardist Jerry Hughes taking over as lead vocalist on the album.<ref name=\"music\"/> Later on, Lyle Gudmunsen was briefly signed on as lead singer. The band broke up shortly after Gudmunsen joined, and he began a solo career.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.willistonherald.com/articles/2006/06/19/local_news/news2.txt |title=Gudmunsen sings lead song on \"Cars\" CD |access-date=2007-12-28 |last=Kvamme |first=Thomas A. |date=2006-06-19 |work=Williston Herald}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:10em;\"| Title\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:18em;\"| Album details\n! colspan=\"3\"| Peak chart positions\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n! width=\"45\"| [[Top Country Albums|US Country]]<br><ref>{{cite magazine|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=yankee grey|chart=Country Albums C}}|title=Yankee Grey Album & Song Chart History - Country Albums|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|access-date=September 2, 2011}}</ref>\n! width=\"45\"| [[Top Heatseekers|US<br>Heat]]<br><ref name=\"Heatseekers\">{{cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kw0EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA18|title=Billboard's Heatseekers Album Chart|date=January 8, 2000|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|access-date=September 3, 2011}}</ref>\n! width=\"45\"| [[RPM (magazine)|CAN Country]]<br><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-110.01-e.php?PHPSESSID=f24jn9694hg0edhmn5oubvt0a1&q1=Yankee+Grey&q2=Country+Albums%2FCDs&interval=20|title=Results - RPM - Library and Archives Canada - Country Albums/CDs|work=[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]|access-date=September 2, 2011}}</ref>\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[Untamed (Yankee Grey album)|Untamed]]''\n| \n* Release date: September 21, 1999\n* Label: [[Monument Records|Monument Nashville]]\n* Formats: [[Compact disc|CD]], [[Compact cassette|cassette]]\n| 41\n| 31\n| 19\n|- \n! scope=\"row\"| ''Yankee Grey 2''\n| \n* Release date: 2002\n* Label: Stonewall Music, Inc.\n* Formats: CD, cassette\n| —\n| —\n| —\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" style=\"font-size:8pt\"| \"—\" denotes releases that did not chart\n|-\n|}\n\n===Singles===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Year\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:12em;\"| Single\n! colspan=\"3\"| Peak chart positions\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Album\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n! width=\"45\"| [[Hot Country Songs|US Country]]<br><ref>{{cite magazine|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=yankee grey|chart=Country Songs}}|title=Yankee Grey Album & Song Chart History - Country Songs|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|access-date=September 2, 2011}}</ref>\n! width=\"45\"| [[Billboard Hot 100|US]]<br><ref>{{cite magazine|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=yankee grey|chart=Hot 100}}|title=Yankee Grey Album & Song Chart History - Hot 100|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|access-date=September 2, 2011}}</ref>\n! width=\"45\"| [[RPM (magazine)|CAN Country]]<br><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-110.01-e.php?PHPSESSID=aboltr6bvkjv4k2l94obp0a096&q1=Yankee+Grey&q2=Country+Singles&interval=20|title=Results - RPM - Library and Archives Canada - Country Singles|work=[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]|access-date=September 2, 2011}}</ref>\n|-\n| 1999 \n! scope=\"row\"| \"[[All Things Considered (song)|All Things Considered]]\"\n| 8\n| 54\n| 16\n| align=\"left\" rowspan=\"4\"| ''Untamed''\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\"| 2000\n! scope=\"row\"| \"[[Another Nine Minutes]]\"\n| 15\n| 74\n| 23\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"This Time Around\"\n| 43\n| —\n| 67\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Untamed\"\n| —\n| —\n| —\n|-\n| colspan=\"6\" style=\"font-size:8pt\"| \"—\" denotes releases that did not chart\n|-\n|}\n\n===Music videos===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n!
