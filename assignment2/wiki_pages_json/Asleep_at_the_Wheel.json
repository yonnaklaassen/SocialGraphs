After moving to [[MCA Records|MCA]], co-founder Lucky Oceans left, followed in September 1986 by Chris O'Connell due to her pregnancy. Asleep at the Wheel gathered a large amount of debt that required it to work on [[Television advertisement|commercials]] and [[movie soundtrack]]s.  This band produced the soundtrack for the film ''[[Liar's Moon]]''.\n\nIn 1985, the band released a virtually ignored self-titled album.<ref name=\"allmusicguide\"/> By the late 1980s, Ray Benson had done some producing, allowing the band a second chance with [[Epic Records]]. In 1987, the band released ''10'', which won them their second Grammy for Best Country Instrumental, helping to launch their comeback.
