He has released 10 studio albums on various labels, and has released 34 singles to country radio. Although he first charted on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] chart in 1988, he did not reach the top 40 for the first time until 1992's \"Where Forever Begins\", which peaked at number 40. McCoy broke through two years later with the back-to-back number one singles \"[[No Doubt About It (Neal McCoy song)|No Doubt About It]]\" and \"[[Wink (song)|Wink]]\" from his platinum-certified album ''[[No Doubt About It (album)|No Doubt About It]]''. Although he has not topped the country charts since, his commercial success continued into the mid to late 1990s with two more platinum albums and a gold album, as well as six more top 10 hits. A ninth top 10 hit, the number 10 \"[[Billy's Got His Beer Goggles On]]\", came in 2005 from his self-released ''[[That's Life (Neal McCoy album)|That's Life]]''.\n\n==Early life==\nHubert Neal McGaughey Jr. was born on July 30, 1958, in [[Jacksonville, Texas]], to a Filipino-American mother and Irish-American father. Inspired by the variety of music that his parents listened to, which included [[Country music|country]], [[rock music|rock]], [[disco]] and [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], McGaughey first sang in his church choir before founding an R&B band.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> He later switched his focus to country music, performing in various bars and clubs in Texas. McGaughey, after attending [[junior college]] near his hometown, found work selling shoes at a shopping mall. In the early 1980s, he met his wife, Melinda, at the store.\n\nAfter winning a 1981 talent contest hosted by [[Janie Fricke]], he secured a spot as an opening act for [[Charley Pride]].<ref name=\"allmusic\"/>\n\n==Musical career==\nCrediting himself as Neal McGoy, a phonetic spelling of his surname,<ref name=\"whitburn\"/> he signed to the independent [[16th Avenue Records]] label in 1988. He released the singles \"That's How Much I Love You\" and \"That's American\", and although the former reached No.&nbsp;85 on the country charts,<ref name=\"whitburn\">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2008|publisher=Record Research, Inc.|date=August 2008|page=266|isbn=978-0-89820-177-2}}</ref> he did not release an album for the label.

His debut album, ''[[At This Moment (album)|At This Moment]]'', was released that year. None of the three singles made the country Top 40, although the lead-off single \"If I Built You a Fire\" was a Top 20 country hit in Canada. The other two releases were the [[At This Moment|title track]], a cover of [[Billy Vera]] and the Beaters' #1 Hot 100 hit from late 1986-early 1987,<ref name=\"encyclopedia\">{{cite book|editor1=Paul Kingsbury |editor2=Michael McCall |editor3=John W.

This album produced his first American Top 40 country hit in its No.&nbsp;40-peaking title track,<ref name=\"whitburn\"/> followed by \"There Ain't Nothin' I Don't Like About You\" at No.&nbsp;57, and \"Now I Pray for Rain\" at No.&nbsp;26. The album was also his first entry on [[Top Country Albums]], at No.&nbsp;58.\n\nWorking with producer [[Barry Beckett]] for the first time, McCoy released his breakthrough album, ''[[No Doubt About It (album)|No Doubt About It]]'', in 1994. The album produced his only number 1 country hits in its title track and \"[[Wink (song)|Wink]]\", both of which also made minor entries on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The album also earned a platinum certification from the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) and gold certification from the [[Canadian Recording Industry Association]] (CRIA). Its final single was \"[[The City Put the Country Back in Me]]\" at No.&nbsp;5.\n\n===Mid-Late 1990s===\n[[File:US Navy 050921-N-9274T-015 Three-time platinum album country music singer Neal McCoy performs at a USO concert for military personnel supporting Hurricane Katrina relief efforts.jpg|McCoy in 2005.|alt=Singer Neal McCoy singing into a microphone while looking upward.|200px|thumb|left]]\n''[[You Gotta Love That]]'', his fourth album, also received a platinum certification and it produced four singles: \"[[For a Change]]\", \"They're Playin' Our Song\" and the [[You Gotta Love That (song)|title track]] (respectively the first, second, and fourth singles) all peaked at No.&nbsp;3, while \"[[If I Was a Drinkin' Man]]\" reached No.&nbsp;16.<ref name=\"whitburn\"/>\n\nMcCoy's [[Neal McCoy (album)|self-titled]] fifth studio album began a decline in his chart momentum. Although it was certified gold, ''Neal McCoy'' accounted for only one Top Ten hit in a cover of [[The Casinos]]' 1967 [[doo-wop]] single \"[[Then You Can Tell Me Goodbye]]\".<ref name=\"encyclopedia\"/> The next two singles — \"Going, Going, Gone\" and \"That Woman of Mine\" — both peaked at No.&nbsp;35. Also in 1996, he sang guest vocals on the multi-artist charity single \"Hope\", the proceeds of which went to the [[Tony Martell|T. J. Martell Foundation]]'s cancer research.<ref>Whitburn, p. 193</ref> After \"That Woman of Mine\", he reached No.&nbsp;5 with \"[[The Shake (Neal McCoy song)|The Shake]]\", the only new song on his first ''[[Greatest Hits (Neal McCoy album)|Greatest Hits]]'' package, which reprised nine of his greatest hits to that point and also earned platinum certification.\n\n''[[Be Good at It]]'', his sixth studio release, followed in 1998. This was his first album since ''Where Forever Begins'' not to include a Top Ten hit. The title track, \"If You Can't Be Good, Be Good at It\", was the highest-peaking single release from it at No.&nbsp;22, followed by \"Party On\", which became his first single since 1992 to miss Top 40 entirely.<ref name=\"whitburn\"/> After it came the No.&nbsp;29 \"Love Happens Like That.\" McCoy made a second appearance on a multi-artist charity single that same year, as one of several collaborators on \"One Heart at a Time\", a song written by [[Victoria Shaw (singer)|Victoria Shaw]] to benefit [[cystic fibrosis]] research.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bernarde|first=Scott R.|title=Stars of David: Rock'n'roll's Jewish Stories|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XI4-VnSrEcAC&q=%22one+heart+at+a+time%22+%22olivia+newton+john%22&pg=PA329|year=2003|publisher=UPNE|isbn=1584653035|page=329}}</ref>\n\nIn 1999, McCoy released his final album for Atlantic, ''[[The Life of the Party (album)|The Life of the Party]]''.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> It only accounted for two singles: the [[Phil Vassar]] co-write \"I Was\" at No.&nbsp;37 and \"The Girls of Summer\" at No.&nbsp;42. He, [[Tracy Byrd]], and [[T. Graham Brown]] also sang guest vocals on \"Now That's Awesome\", a song featuring snippets of a [[Bill Engvall]] comedy sketch, found on Engvall's ''[[Now That's Awesome]]'' album. This single peaked at No.&nbsp;59.<ref name=\"whitburn\"/> McCoy has performed every July since 1994 at The Hodag Country Festival in Rhinelander,Wisconsin.\n\n===2000–04: Warner Bros. Records and SEA Records===\nDue to the closure of Atlantic Records' Nashville division in mid-2000, McCoy's next album, ''[[24-7-365 (Neal McCoy album)|24-7-365]]'', was issued via [[Giant Records (Warner)|Giant Records]]. It included the singles \"Forever Works for Me (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday)\", \"Every Man for Himself\", and \"Beatin' It In\", at No.&nbsp;38, No.&nbsp;37, and No.&nbsp;41 respectively. In late 2000, he released a Christmas medley consisting of \"[[I'll Be Home for Christmas]]\" and \"[[Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas]]\", which reached number 74 based on seasonal airplay.<ref name=\"whitburn\"/> After Giant closed as well, he moved again to [[Warner Bros. Records]], where he recorded ''The Luckiest Man in the World''. Although the title track entered the country charts and peaked at number 46,<ref name=\"whitburn\"/> the album itself was not released, and McCoy exited Warner Bros. by the end of the year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cmt.com/news/articles/1483906/20031229/mccoy_neal.jhtml?headlines=true |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040116153627/http://www.cmt.com/news/articles/1483906/20031229/mccoy_neal.jhtml?headlines=true |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 16, 2004 |title=It's a Neal McCoy/Wayne Newton New Year |access-date=2009-11-23 |work=CMT.com}}</ref> He signed with an independent label called SEA Records in 2004, and was slated to release a single for it in the middle of the year,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/news-in-brief/1486806/new-deal-for-mccoy-no-deal-for-pinmonkey.jhtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927134230/http://www.cmt.com/news/news-in-brief/1486806/new-deal-for-mccoy-no-deal-for-pinmonkey.jhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 27, 2013|title=New Deal for McCoy, No Deal for Pinmonkey|publisher=4 May 2004|pages=[[Country Music Television]]|access-date=22 September 2013}}</ref> but he left the label without releasing anything.<ref name=\"goggles\">{{cite magazine|last=Stark|first=Phyllis|title=McCoy finds new 'life' on his own label|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|volume=117|issue=35|page=50|date=27 August 2005|issn=0006-2510|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-BIEAAAAMBAJ&q=%22billy%27s+got+his+beer+goggles+on%22&pg=PA50}}</ref>\n\n===2005–07===\nIn 2005, Neal McCoy and his manager Karen Kane founded a label called 903 Music. His first single for his own label was \"[[Billy's Got His Beer Goggles On]]\", which reached the Top 10 on the [[Hot Country Songs]] chart in 2005. The song served as the lead-off to his 2005 album ''[[That's Life (Neal McCoy album)|That's Life]]''. Also included on the album were a cover of Charley Pride's \"[[You're My Jamaica]],\" (Charley Pride also appeared on the tune), and a studio version of \"Hillbilly Rap\", which he had performed in concert since the early 1990s.<ref name=\"goggles\"/> McCoy's next single release, \"The Last of a Dying Breed\", a song preceded by a spoken-word intro from [[United States Army]] general [[Tommy Franks]], peaked at 36.<ref name=\"whitburn\"/>\n\n[[Darryl Worley]] and the [[Drew Davis Band]] were signed to 903 as well. Worley released his 2006 album ''[[Here and Now (Darryl Worley album)|Here and Now]]'' on 903, which produced the top 40 hits \"Nothin' but a Love Thang\" and \"[[I Just Came Back from a War]]\". In May 2007, McCoy announced that the label had filed for bankruptcy and closed its doors.<ref name=\"encyclopedia\"/><ref>{{cite web|last=Brooks |first=Dave |url=http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/content_display/industry/e3i6aa5bb36869cfa84fd7b70898175ddec |title=Billboard Business &#124; Billboard |website=Billboard.biz |access-date=2020-04-28}}</ref>\n\nIn Summer of 2007, Neal could be seen showing off his comedic chops on local TV commercials in the [[Waco, Texas]] market for Mike Craig Chevrolet Pontiac Buick in [[Marlin, Texas]].  The commercials continued for approximately one year.  In one of them Neal acts like a puppet in the hands of the branch manager of the Mike Craig dealership in [[Hillsboro, Texas]].\n\n===2008–13: ''The Very Best of Neal McCoy'', ''XII'', and ''Pride''===\nIn 2008, [[Rhino Records]] issued a compilation album entitled ''The Very Best of Neal McCoy''. This album reprised most of his biggest chart hits to that point, and it included the new recording \"Rednecktified\", which was released as a single but did not chart. Later that same year, he issued another single, \"For the Troops\", which also failed to chart. McCoy released a book titled ''New Mountain to Climb'' in 2011, which coincided with the release of a single of the same name.\n\nIn April 2011, McCoy signed with Blaster Music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.websterpr.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=532:neal-mccoy-brings-his-multi-platinum-career-to-blaster-records&catid=62:neal-mccoy&Itemid=15 |title=HOME - Kirt Webster |website=Websterpr.com |date=2013-11-22 |access-date=2020-04-28}}</ref> He released his twelfth album, ''[[XII (Neal McCoy album)|XII]]'', for the label on March 6, 2012.

The album features guest appearances from [[Darius Rucker]], [[Trace Adkins]], and [[Raul Malo]] of [[The Mavericks]].
