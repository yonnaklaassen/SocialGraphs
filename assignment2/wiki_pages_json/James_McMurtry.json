He performs with veteran bandmates Daren Hess, Cornbread and Tim Holt.\n\nHis father, novelist [[Larry McMurtry]], gave him his first guitar at age seven. His mother, an English professor, taught him how to play it: \"My mother taught me three chords and the rest I just stole as I went along. I learned everything by ear or by watching people.\"\n\n==Biography==\nMcMurtry spent his first seven years in Ft. Worth<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hobotrashcan.com/2008/04/17/one-on-one-with-james-mcmurtry/ |title=One on One with James McMurtry |publisher=HoboTrashcan |date=2008-04-17 |access-date=2012-11-21}}</ref> but was raised mostly in [[Leesburg, Virginia]]. He attended the [[Woodberry Forest School]], [[Orange, Virginia]]. He began performing in his teens, writing bits and pieces.  He started performing his own songs at a downtown [[beer garden]] while studying English and Spanish at the [[University of Arizona]] in [[Tucson]]. After traveling to [[Alaska]] and playing a few gigs, he returned to [[Texas]] and his father's  \"little bitty ranch house crammed with 10,000 books\". After a time, he left for [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]], where he worked as a house painter, actor, bartender, and sometimes singer, performing at writers' nights and open-mic events.\n\nIn 1987, a friend in San Antonio suggested McMurtry enter the Kerrville Folk Festival New Folk songwriter contest; he became one of six winners that year. Also around this time [[John Mellencamp]] was starring in a film based on a script by McMurtry's father, which gave McMurtry the opportunity to send a demo tape to Mellencamp. Mellencamp subsequently served as co-producer on McMurtry's debut album, ''[[Too Long in the Wasteland]]'' (1989). McMurtry also appeared on the soundtrack of the film ''[[Falling from Grace (film)|Falling from Grace]]'', working with Mellencamp, [[John Prine]], [[Joe Ely]] and [[Dwight Yoakam]] in a \"supergroup\" called Buzzin' Cousins.\n\nMcMurtry released follow-up albums ''[[Candyland (James McMurtry album)|Candyland]]'' (1992) and ''Where'd You Hide the Body'' (1995). 1997 saw the release of \"It Had to Happen\" which included a cover of \"[[Wild Man from Borneo (song)|Wild Man from Borneo]]\" originally done by Kinky Friedman and \"[[Sixty Acres]]\"; a rollicking tune about a dead grandma and the events afterwards.\n\n''Walk Between the Raindrops'' followed in 1998 and 2002 brought ''St. Mary of the Woods''. In April 2004, McMurtry released a tour album called ''Live in Aught-Three''. \"[[Choctaw Bingo]]\", one of McMurtry's most popular songs, is featured on both ''St. Mary of the Woods'' and ''Live in Aught-Three''.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/life/the_spectator/2009/03/choctaw_bingo.html|author=Rosenbaum, Ron|title=Choctaw Bingo : A modest proposal for a new national anthem|journal=SLATE|date=13 March 2009|access-date=13 March 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, McMurtry released his first studio album in three years. ''[[Childish Things]]'' again received high critical praise, winning the song and album of the year at the 5th Annual [[Americana Music Honors & Awards|Americana Music Awards]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. The album was perhaps McMurtry at his most political, as his working-class anthem \"We Can't Make It Here\" included direct criticism of [[George W. Bush]], the [[Iraq War]], and [[Wal-Mart]]. The music critic [[Robert Christgau]] ranked \"We Can't Make It Here\" as the best song of the 2000s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/list/rs00.php |title=Rolling Stone Ballot: The 00's Best Songs & Albums |publisher=Robert Christgau |access-date=2012-11-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102174101/http://robertchristgau.com/xg/list/rs00.php |archive-date=2010-01-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nMcMurtry released his follow-up album to ''[[Childish Things]]'' in April 2008. ''[[Just Us Kids]]'' continued with the previous album's political themes and included the song \"Cheney's Toy,\" McMurtry's most direct criticism of [[George W. Bush]] so far. Like \"We Can't Make It Here\" from the previous album, \"Cheney's Toy\" was made available as a free Internet download.\n\nMcMurtry's ninth album, ''[[Complicated Game (album)|Complicated Game]]'' was released on February 24, 2015 on an L.A. record label also named Complicated Game.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2014/11/04/james-mcmurtry-returns-with-howm-i-gonna-find-you-now-from-new-lp-exclusive/ |title=James McMurtry Returns With 'How'm I Gonna Find You Now' From New LP (Exclusive)|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=4 November 2014|publisher=The Wall St Journal |access-date=2014-11-07|last1=Danton|first1=Eric R.}}</ref> The album achieved critical acclaim, scoring 87 on Metacritic.

After using this platform to premiere new songs including \"If It Don't Bleed\", a new album, ''The Horses and the Hounds'', was announced on June 9, 2021 and released on August 20. Lead track \"Canola Fields\" was released to streaming services at the time of the announcement and would go on to get an Americana Music Award nomination.
