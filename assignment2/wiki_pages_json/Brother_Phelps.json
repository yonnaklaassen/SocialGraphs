Prior to the duo's formation in 1992, both brothers were members of [[The Kentucky Headhunters]], a [[Southern rock]]-influenced [[country rock]] band. In 1993, Brother Phelps charted with its debut single \"[[Let Go (Brother Phelps song)|Let Go]]\", which reached a peak of No.&nbsp;6 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country music charts. In all, the duo charted six singles between 1993 and 1995 (although only one other single reached Top 40), in addition to recording two albums on [[Asylum Records]]. Brother Phelps disbanded in 1995, with Doug rejoining the Kentucky Headhunters as lead singer, and Ricky Lee assuming a solo career.\n\n==Biography==\nThe Brothers are Ricky Lee Phelps, who was born in 1953 [[Edmonton, Kentucky]],<ref name=\n\"oldies\">{{cite web |url=http://www.oldies.com/artist-biography/Brother-Phelps.html |title=Brother Phelps Biography |accessdate=2007-07-21 |work=Oldies.com}}</ref> and Doug Phelps who was born in Leachville, Arkansas, in 1960. They were raised in the [[Missouri Bootheel]] and Doug graduated from a small school named Southland in [[Cardwell, Missouri]]. They joined [[The Kentucky Headhunters]] in 1986.
