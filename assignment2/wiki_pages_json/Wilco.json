The band was formed in 1994 by the remaining members of [[alternative country]] group [[Uncle Tupelo]] after singer [[Jay Farrar]]'s departure. Wilco's lineup changed frequently during its first decade, with only singer [[Jeff Tweedy]] and bassist [[John Stirratt]] remaining from the original incarnation. Since early 2004 the lineup has been unchanged, consisting of Tweedy, Stirratt, guitarist [[Nels Cline]], multi-instrumentalist [[Pat Sansone]], keyboard player [[Mikael Jorgensen]], and drummer [[Glenn Kotche]]. Wilco has released thirteen studio albums, a live double album, and four collaborations: three with [[Billy Bragg]] and one with [[the Minus 5]].\n\nWilco's music has been inspired by a wide variety of artists and styles including [[Bill Fay]], [[the Beatles]], and [[Television (band)|Television]]; in turn the band has influenced music by many modern alternative rock acts. The band continued in the [[alternative country]] style of Uncle Tupelo on its debut album ''[[A.M. (Wilco album)|A.M.]]'' (1995), but has since introduced more [[experimental music|experimental]] aspects to their music, including elements of [[alternative rock]] and classic pop. Wilco's musical style has evolved from a 1990s country rock sound to a current \"eclectic [[indie rock]] collective that touches on many eras and genres\".<ref>{{cite web |date=September 25, 2012 |title=Indie-Rockers Wilco Make First Appearance At The Cascade Theatre Sept 26 |url=http://anewscafe.com/2012/09/25/indie-rockers-wilco-make-first-appearance-at-the-cascade-theatre-sept-26/ |author=Press Release}}</ref>\n\nWilco received media attention for their fourth album, ''[[Yankee Hotel Foxtrot]]'' (2001), and the controversy surrounding it. After the recording sessions were complete, [[Reprise Records]] rejected the album and dismissed Wilco from the label. As part of a buy-out deal, Reprise gave Wilco the rights to the album for free. After streaming ''Foxtrot'' on its website, Wilco sold the album to [[Nonesuch Records]] in 2002. Both record labels are subsidiaries of [[Warner Music Group]], leading a critic to say the album showed \"how screwed up the music business is in the early twenty-first century.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Fricke|first=David|author-link=David Fricke|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/yankee-hotel-foxtrot-250882/|title=Yankee Hotel Foxtrot (review)|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=May 9, 2002|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070912001355/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/wilco/albums/album/322307/review/5946403/yankee_hotel_foxtrot |archive-date = September 12, 2007|access-date=December 6, 2021}}</ref> The event was immortalized in the documentary [[I Am Trying to Break Your Heart: A Film About Wilco|''I Am Trying to Break Your Heart'']]; director [[Sam Jones (photographer)|Sam Jones]] followed the band as they wrote and produced the record. ''Yankee Hotel Foxtrot'' is Wilco's most successful release to date, selling over 670,000 copies. Wilco won two [[Grammy Award]]s for their fifth studio album, 2004's ''[[A Ghost Is Born]]'', including [[Best Alternative Music Album]]. Wilco released their thirteenth studio album, ''[[Cousin (album)|Cousin]]'', in September 2023.\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation, ''A.M.'', and ''Being There'' (1994–1996)===\n{{Main|Uncle Tupelo}}\nWilco was formed following the breakup of the influential alternative country music group [[Uncle Tupelo]].

Tweedy's new band included all current members of Uncle Tupelo lineup sans Farrar, including [[bassist]] John Stirratt, [[drummer]] [[Ken Coomer]], and multi-instrumentalist [[Max Johnston (musician)|Max Johnston]]. He even enlisted Uncle Tupelo guest guitarist [[Brian Henneman]] of [[the Bottle Rockets]] to perform, who appears on many of the tracks for Wilco's debut album, ''[[A.M.

The lyrical theme of the songs reflected a relationship between musical artist and a listener; Tweedy chose this topic because he sought to eschew the alternative country fan base. Ken Coomer elaborated:<ref>Kot 2004. p. 110–1</ref>\n\n<blockquote>The whole ''[[No Depression (periodical)|No Depression]]'' thing was funny to us because people seemed to forget that Jeff was a bigger punk-rock fan than a country fan.

The band went through some personnel changes during the recording sessions. Max Johnston left the band because he felt that his role in the band had diminished in favor of Bennett; he had also been replaced by violinist Jesse Greene on one track because the band felt that Johnston was unable to play the part. Bob Egan of [[Freakwater]] briefly joined the band in the studio, playing [[pedal steel guitar]] on \"Far, Far Away\" and \"Dreamer in My Dreams\", and then became an official member in September 1996.<ref>Kot 2004. p. 115</ref><ref>Kot 2004. p. 119</ref>\n\nUnlike the ''A.M.'' recording sessions, the band had no desire to produce a hit song from their second effort.<ref>Kot 2004. p. 114</ref> The recording sessions produced nineteen songs, too many for a single album release. Tweedy was concerned about the high retail price that a [[double album]] would be sold for (at least $30), so he asked Reprise Records to release it as a double album at a single album price ($17.98 or less). Reprise agreed to this on the terms that they received Wilco's share of the album royalties. It was estimated in 2003 that the band lost almost $600,000 on the deal, but Tweedy was satisfied.<ref>Kot 2004. p. 116</ref> ''Being There'' was well received by critics from several major media outlets, including ''[[Rolling Stone]]''.<ref name=\"ND\"/><ref>{{cite web |last=Deming |first=Mark |url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=being-there-mw0000613155#review|pure_url=yes}} |title=''Being There'' Review |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=September 15, 2024}} {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110325044108/http://www.allmusic.com/album/being-there-r241294/review |title=Original review by Jason Ankeny |date=March 25, 2011}}.</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|last=Kot|first=Greg|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/being-there-203447/|title=Being There |magazine=Rolling Stone|date=October 24, 1996|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070619094452/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/wilco/albums/album/240156/review/5946124/being_there |archive-date = June 19, 2007|access-date=December 6, 2021}}</ref> The album reached No. 73 on the ''Billboard'' album charts,<ref>{{cite magazine|title=The ''Billboard'' 200|magazine=Billboard|date=November 16, 1996}}</ref> a significant improvement from ''A.M.'', and placed fourteenth on the Pazz & Jop Critics Poll for 1996.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/pnj/pjres96.php|title=The 1996 Pazz & Jop Critics Poll|newspaper=The Village Voice}} Last accessed July 11, 2007.</ref> The album's single \"Outtasite (Outta Mind)\" became the group's first song to enter the ''Billboard'' charts, reaching No. 39 on the [[Alternative Songs|Modern Rock Tracks]] chart and No. 22 on the [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart.<ref>{{cite web |title=Wilco Awards |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=wilco-mn0000254215#awards|pure_url=yes}} |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=September 15, 2024}}</ref>\n\n===''Summerteeth'' and the ''Mermaid Avenue'' sessions (1997–2000)===\nIn November 1997, Wilco entered [[Willie Nelson]]'s recording studio in [[Spicewood]], [[Texas]] to record a third studio album.<ref name=\"Kot-2004\">Kot 2004. p. 138</ref> The album was lyrically inspired by the marital problems of Tweedy and his wife, as well as by twentieth-century [[literature]].<ref>Kot 2004. p. 135</ref> Tweedy relied heavily on Bennett to provide music for the singer's \"bold, but depressing\" lyrics.<ref>Kot 2004. p. 140–1</ref> Wilco recorded several songs, including \"Via Chicago\" and \"She's a Jar\", but began working on another project before assembling the tracks into an album.<ref name=\"Kot-2004\"/>\n[[File:Woody Guthrie 2.jpg|left|thumb|The two ''Mermaid Avenue'' albums  are recordings of unreleased [[Woody Guthrie]] (''pictured'') songs]]\n[[Nora Guthrie]] contacted singer-songwriter [[Billy Bragg]] in spring 1995 about recording some unreleased songs by her father, folk singer [[Woody Guthrie]]. Most of the songs were written late in Guthrie's life when he was unable to record due to the motor impairments of [[Huntington's disease]]. By the 1990s, Woody Guthrie had become a \"relic\" to the [[MTV generation]], and Nora sought to establish a different legacy for the musician. To Nora, Bragg was \"the only singer I knew taking on the same issues as Woody.\" Bragg was concerned, however, that his fans would not realize that the songs were written by Guthrie when he performed them on tour, so he decided to record the album with another band.<ref>Kot 2004. p. 143</ref>\n\nBragg contacted Tweedy and Bennett about co-recording the album while Wilco was on the European segment of their ''Being There'' tour. Bragg was particularly fond of ''Being There'' because their influences extended farther back than the 1950s. Although Tweedy was indifferent to the offer, Bennett was enthused about recording songs with one of his idols—Bennett's previous band Titanic Love Affair was named after a Billy Bragg lyric. A recording contract between Bragg and Wilco was signed after a show at [[Shepherd's Bush Empire]]. Bragg mostly recorded the politically charged lyrics, while Tweedy preferred to record lyrics that showcased Guthrie as a \"freak weirdo.\" The recording of ''[[Mermaid Avenue]]'' began on December 12, 1997, and was the topic of [[BBC]]'s ''[[Man in the Sand]]'' documentary film.<ref>Kot 2004. p. 144–5</ref>\n\nTempers flared between Bragg and Wilco after the album was completed. Bennett believed that Bragg was overproducing his songs, a sharp contrast to Wilco's sparser contributions. Bennett called Bragg about the possibility of remixing Bragg's songs, to which Bragg responded \"you make your record, and I'll make mine...\" Eventually Bragg sent copies of his recordings to Chicago for Bennett to remix, but Bragg refused to use the new mixes on the album. The two parties were unable to establish a promotional tour and quarreled over royalties and guest musician fees.\n\nDespite these conflicts, the album was released on June 23, 1998, and sold over 277,000 copies.<ref>Kot 2004. p. 151–3</ref> The album received rave reviews from Robert Christgau and ''Rolling Stone'', and was nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album]].<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Marcus|first=Greil|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/kicking-television-live-in-chicago-249386/|title=Mermaid Avenue |magazine=Rolling Stone|date=June 1, 1998|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071002102709/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/wilco/albums/album/225606/review/6213088/mermaid_avenue |archive-date = October 2, 2007|access-date=December 6, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Christgau|first=Robert|author-link=Robert Christgau|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?id=2579&name=Billy+Bragg+%26+Wilco|title=CG: Billy Bragg & Wilco|publisher=robertchristgau.com}} Last accessed July 14, 2007.</ref> It also placed fourth on the Pazz & Jop critics poll for 1998.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/pnj/pjres98.php|title=The 1998 Pazz & Jop Critics Poll|newspaper=The Village Voice}} Last accessed July 14, 2007.</ref> After the album was released, Bob Egan was replaced by multi-instrumentalist [[Leroy Bach]].<ref>Kot 2004. p. 169</ref>\n\nAfter the completion of the ''Mermaid Avenue'' sessions, Wilco returned to Spicewood to complete their third studio album, ''[[Summerteeth]]''. Unlike previous Wilco and Uncle Tupelo recordings, the album featured a lot of overdubbing with [[Pro Tools]].<ref>Kot 2004. p. 154–5</ref> Stirratt and Coomer were concerned with the production, since it reduced their involvement in the music. According to Stirratt:<ref>Kot 2004. p. 158</ref>\n\n<blockquote>The story of ''Summerteeth'' is Jay bought a [[Mellotron]] and he was going to use it, no matter what. It was lovely, but it was overdone. Once they got going on the overdubs, they didn't stop. And nobody in the band stepped up to stop the madness&nbsp;... It reminds me of ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'', where you knowingly extend the creative process for the purpose of exploration or redemption, or whatever it is you're looking for.</blockquote>\n\nDuring 1999, Warner Brothers was looking to help repay a $16 billion debt acquired during the recent merger of parent company Warner Communications with [[Time Inc.]]<ref>Kot 2004. p. 161</ref> As a result, Warner's [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]]s were under pressure to produce musical acts that would yield hit records. The head of Reprise, [[Howie Klein]], who had previously authorized the release of ''Being There'' as a double album, was willing to let Wilco produce ''Summerteeth'' without label input. When Klein played the album for Reprise's A&R department, however, they demanded a radio single for the album. Wilco agreed to do this \"once and once only\" and recorded a radio-friendly version of \"Can't Stand It\" at the request of [[David Kahne]], the head of the A&R department.<ref>Kot 2004. p. 162–5</ref> The single version of \"Can't Stand It\" failed to cross over from [[Adult album alternative|Triple-A]] radio to alternative rock stations. The album sold only 200,000 copies, significantly less than ''Being There''<ref>Kot 2004. p. 167</ref> despite critical acclaim; the album placed eighth on the Pazz & Jop critics' poll for 1999.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/pnj/pjres99.php|title=The 1999 Pazz & Jop Critics Poll|newspaper=The Village Voice}} Last accessed July 15, 2007.</ref>\n\nAfter the release of ''[[Summerteeth]]'', the band resumed the ''Mermaid Avenue'' sessions. Although they had recorded enough material for a second release in 1998, Wilco recorded a few new songs for ''[[Mermaid Avenue Vol. II]]''. \"Someday Some Morning Sometime,\" featuring a [[vibraphone]] filtered through a [[space echo]], was identified by Tweedy as being the \"piece to the puzzle\" towards the creation of their fourth studio album. The album was released on May 30, 2000, and was the last release from the sessions.<ref>Kot 2004. p. 175</ref> The remainder of the sessions were released in 2012 as ''[[Mermaid Avenue Vol. III]]'', also part of ''[[Mermaid Avenue: The Complete Sessions]]''.\n\n===Departure from Reprise Records and ''Yankee Hotel Foxtrot'' (2001–2002)===\n[[File:Marina City, Chicago, Illinois, Estados Unidos, 2012-10-20, DD 01.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Marina City|Marina Towers]] in [[Chicago, IL|Chicago]] are depicted on the cover of ''[[Yankee Hotel Foxtrot]].]]\n{{Listen|filename=I Am Trying to Break Your Heart.ogg|title=\"I Am Trying to Break Your Heart\"|description=The first track from ''Yankee Hotel Foxtrot'', this song featured an intro on bells composed by Glenn Kotche.|format=[[Ogg]]}}\nShortly after the recording sessions for ''Mermaid Avenue Vol. II'', Wilco purchased a studio on Irving Park Road in Chicago, which they named the Wilco Loft.<ref>Kot 2004. p. 168</ref> The band recorded tracks in the studio in early 2000 for a fourth studio album. In May 2000, Jeff Tweedy requested to perform with [[Jim O'Rourke (musician)|Jim O'Rourke]] at a festival in Chicago; Tweedy was a fan of O'Rourke's ''[[Bad Timing (album)|Bad Timing]]''. O'Rourke introduced Tweedy to drummer [[Glenn Kotche]], and the trio enjoyed working together so much that they decided to record an album as a side project named [[Loose Fur]].<ref>Kot 2004. p. 177–9</ref> Wilco had recorded an entire album of music at this point, but Tweedy was unhappy with the drum parts. He enjoyed Kotche's contributions to Loose Fur so much that Tweedy brought him into the studio to re-record some demos. Some believe that Tweedy sought to make Wilco sound like Loose Fur after officially replacing Ken Coomer with Kotche in January 2001.<ref>Kot 2004. p. 186–8</ref>\n\nAlthough Bennett sought to be the mixer and engineer for ''[[Yankee Hotel Foxtrot]]'', Tweedy was unsure of Bennett's abilities compared to O'Rourke. Tweedy and Bennett frequently argued over whether the album should be accessible to a general listener, or attempt to cover new musical ground.<ref>Kot 2004. p. 195–6</ref> Unbeknownst to Bennett, Tweedy invited O'Rourke to remix \"I Am Trying to Break Your Heart\", and the results impressed the other band members—even Bennett. Tensions grew between Bennett and O'Rourke because Bennett wanted to mix every song on the album. O'Rourke cut the contributions of other members on several of the songs; some songs, such as \"Poor Places\", only featured the Loose Fur trio.<ref>Kot 2004. p. 198–9</ref> The album was completed in 2001, and Bennett was dismissed from the band immediately afterwards.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Fricke|first=David|title=In from the Cold|magazine=[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]|date=May 2002}}</ref> The recording of the album was documented by [[Sam Jones (filmmaker)|Sam Jones]] and released in 2002 as the film ''[[I Am Trying to Break Your Heart: A Film About Wilco]]''.\n\nTime Warner, which owned Warner Bros. Records, merged with [[America Online]] in 2001, leading to more pressure on Warner's record labels to cut costs. Over 600 employees of Warner Music Group were fired, including Howie Klein, the president of Reprise Records. \n\nDavid Kahne became the interim head of Reprise.<ref>Kot 2004. p. 201</ref> Kahne assigned Mio Vukovic to monitor the progress of ''Yankee Hotel Foxtrot'' and to offer suggestions.

Bennett once described hearing the open spaces of the songs and holes that became his sonic landscape.

It takes a hard look at Bennett's treatment in the previous Wilco documentary, ''[[I Am Trying to Break Your Heart: A Film About Wilco|I Am Trying To Break Your Heart]]'', which many consider to be unfair. \"Jay Bennett's reputation never quite recovered from the battering it took in Sam Jones' documentary ''I Am Trying To Break Your Heart: A Film About Wilco'', about the complex, lengthy gestation of 2002's ''Yankee Hotel Foxtrot'' in often painful detail, portrayed a band slowly pulling itself apart, with chief songwriters Bennett and Jeff Tweedy its twin opposing forces.

And it just wasn't working anymore,\" Bechard explained. \"They're both incredibly talented. They both had egos. They both, I think, saw maybe different paths for the band. And ultimately it was Jeff's band, so he's going to win that, and rightfully so. There were other issues, whether it be alcohol or drugs. You know, it was a little bit of everything.
