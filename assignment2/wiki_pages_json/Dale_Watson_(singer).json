The family moved to Pasadena, Texas, in 1977. He was  one of four boys. Watson's father and his brother, Jim, were both musically inclined and guided what have become his longstanding musical influences. Watson began writing his own songs at age 12, making his first recording two years later. Soon after, Watson became an emancipated minor. By day he went to school and by night he played local [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] clubs and honky-tonks with Jim, in an aggregation called The Classic Country Band.<ref>{{cite web|last=Burke|first=Ken|title=Biography|url=http://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/article.asp?xid=854|publisher=CST|access-date=5 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nHe moved to Los Angeles in 1988 on the advice of Rosie Flores and soon joined the house band at North Hollywood's now-legendary alt-country venue \"The Palomino Club\". He recorded two singles for [[Curb Records]] in 1990 and 1991, \"One Tear at a Time\" and \"You Pour It On and I Pour It Down\", and appeared on the third volume of the compilation series ''A Town South of Bakersfield'' in 1992. Not long after, he moved to Nashville and spent some time writing songs for the Gary Morris publishing company where his first daughter was born.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rovi|first=Steve|title=Dale Watson Biography|url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/watson_dale/bio.jhtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040222162625/http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/watson_dale/bio.jhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 22, 2004|work=CMT|access-date=5 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nWatson relocated to [[Austin, Texas]], where he formed a backing band called The Lone Stars. He scored a deal with Hightone and released his debut album, ''Cheatin' Heart Attack'', in 1995. It was greeted with enormous acclaim for the vitality Watson brought to his vintage-style material and performances and also featured a dig at mainstream country in \"Nashville Rash\". Follow-up album ''Blessed Or Damned'' appeared in 1996 and continued in a similar vein, as did 1997's ''I Hate These Songs''. His next release, ''The Truckin' Sessions'', appeared on Koch in 1998 and was devoted entirely to that distinct country subgenre of truck-driving songs and soon after, his second daughter was born. Watson attended truck driving school about the time his first album came out and later obtained his commercial driver's license; he often drives the band bus when on tour.<ref>from an interview on the [http://americanamusicshow.com/episode256 Americana Music Show #256], published July 21, 2015.</ref>\n\nThe singer is also featured in the [[Zalman King]] documentary \"Crazy Again\", chronicling his (Watson's) breakdown after his girlfriend Terri Herbert died in a car accident in September 2000. ''Every Song I Write Is For You'' was released in 2001 as a tribute album.<ref>''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' 28 July 2001 - Page 23 Vol. 113, n° 30 -\"Watson is a strong, authoritative vocalist and a sturdy songwriter, and here he dedicates all his sizable talent to his late fiancee, Terri Herbert. The effect is almost too much to take in one sitting — a testament to the quality of these songs... \"Deal With The Devil\" reeks of bitter desperation, and the poignant \"Our First Times and Our Last Times\" is a tribute to the ...\"</ref>\n\nAfter going on hiatus from music in 2004, he moved to [[Baltimore, Maryland]] to be closer to his daughters, Raquel Cain<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6057430/|title=Raquel Cain|website=[[IMDb]] }}</ref> and Dalynn Grace.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/dgracew/|title=Dalynn Grace (@dgracew) • Instagram photos and videos|website=www.instagram.com|language=en|access-date=2019-11-11}}</ref> Dalynn appeared alongside [[Luke Wilson]], [[Johnny Knoxville]] and Knoxville's daughter Madison in Watson's 2007 video for \"Hollywood Hillbilly\"  .<ref>{{cite web|title=Hollywood Hillbilly|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGUeoOeG1Wk |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211221/xGUeoOeG1Wk |archive-date=2021-12-21 |url-status=live|work=Hyena Records|publisher=YouTube|access-date=5 February 2012}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Both Daughters are in pursuit of acting careers as both have attended UT Austin for theatre.\n\nWatson returned to Austin in July 2006 and resumed playing regular gigs, including Sundays at \"Ginny's Little Longhorn Saloon\" and a Monday night residence at \"The Continental Club\".
