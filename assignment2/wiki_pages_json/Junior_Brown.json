He has released twelve studio albums in his career, and has charted twice on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs|country singles charts]]. Brown's signature instrument is the \"guit-steel\" [[double neck guitar]], a hybrid of electric guitar and [[lap steel guitar]].\n\n==Life and career==\nBrown was born in [[Cottonwood, Arizona]]; at an early age his family moved to [[Kirksville, Indiana]].<ref name=\"juniorbrown1\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cmt.com/artists/az/brown_junior/bio.jhtml|title=CMT.com : Junior Brown : Biography|date=February 27, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227034135/https://www.cmt.com/artists/az/brown_junior/bio.jhtml |accessdate=May 29, 2023|archive-date=February 27, 2009 }}</ref> He first learned to play piano from his father (Samuel Emmons Brown Jr.) \"before I could talk\". His music career began in the 1960s, and he worked through that decade and the next singing and playing pedal steel and guitar for groups such as The Last Mile Ramblers, Dusty Drapes and the Dusters, Billy Spears and [[Asleep at the Wheel]] while developing his guitar skills.{{citation needed|date=July 2023}} In the early 1980s, he appeared on stage with [[Rank and File (band)|Rank and File]] as the replacement for [[Alejandro Escovedo]]. However, he did not feature on any recordings by that band.{{citation needed|date=July 2023}}\n\nBy the mid-1980s, Brown was teaching guitar at the [[Hank Thompson (music)|Hank Thompson]] School of Country Music at [[Rogers State University]], in [[Claremore, Oklahoma]].\n\nIn 1985, Brown created a new type of [[double-neck guitar]], with some assistance from Michael Stevens.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stevensguitars.com/models/guit-steel/|title=Guit-Steel|website=Stevensguitars.com|date=April 3, 2009|access-date=March 7, 2023}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.premierguitar.com/gear/reviews/those-daring-young-men-and-their-doubleneck-guitars-a-brief-history-of-multi-neck-players|title=Those Daring Young Men and Their Doubleneck Guitars: A Brief History of Multi-Neck Players - Premier Guitar|website=Premierguitar.com|access-date=March 7, 2023}}</ref> Brown called the instrument his \"guit-steel\". When performing, Brown plays the guitar by standing behind it, while it rests on a small [[music stand]]. The top neck on the guit-steel is a traditional six-string guitar, while the lower neck is a full-size [[lap steel|lap steel guitar]] for slide playing. Brown has two guit-steels for recording and live work. The original instrument, dubbed \"Old Yeller\", has as its standard six-string guitar portion the neck and pickups from Brown's previous stage guitar, a [[Fender Bullet]]. The second guit-steel, named \"Big Red\", has a neck laser-copied from the Bullet neck; but in addition to electric guitar pickups, both the standard and lap-steel necks use identical [[Sho-Bud]] lap-steel pickups. There is a pocket in the upper bout of the guitar to hold the slide bar when it is not in use. Brown also commissioned a \"pedal guit-steel\" which adds pedals to the instrument for more musical control.<ref name=\"americanamusicshow.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://americanamusicshow.com/junior-brown/|title=Junior Brown - Interview and Music|first=Calvin|last=Powers|website=Americanmusicshow.com|date=November 26, 2012|access-date=March 7, 2023}}</ref> Brown has stated that the invention of the guit-steel was always a matter of convenience so that he could play both lap steel and lead guitar during live performances and not directly motivated by a desire to be a \"one man band\".<ref name=\"americanamusicshow.com\"/>\n\n[[File:Junior Brown 2014.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Junior Brown performing at the 2014 [[Kitchener, Ontario|Kitchener]] Blues Festival]]\nBrown quickly became a local success in [[Austin, Texas]], as the house band at the Continental Club.

In 1996, Brown released ''[[Semi Crazy]]'', and followed it with ''[[Long Walk Back]]'' (1998).\n\nIn 1996, Brown was featured on the [[Beach Boys]]' now out-of-print album ''[[Stars and Stripes Vol. 1]]'' performing a cover of their 1962 hit \"409\".

He reprised his role in an episode (\"World of Hurt, BC\") of [[Adult Swim]]'s ''[[Xavier: Renegade Angel]]'' created by rock band [[PFFR]]. In April 2008, Brown shot three pilot episodes of a country music program modeled after programs from the early 1960s, in which Brown will play with a [[house band]] as well as guests as host of the show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/issue/column?oid=oid%3A608447 |title=Off the Record – Music |publisher=The Austin Chronicle |access-date=12 June 2011}}</ref> On October 12, 2012, Brown released the EP ''Volume 10'', containing six new songs.\n\nAMC previewed the video of his new song \"[[Better Call Saul]]\", on October 5, 2014.<ref name= \"saulmusic\">{{cite news |last=Shetty |first=Sharan |url= http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2014/10/05/better_call_saul_music_video_watch_junior_brown_perform_the_breaking_bad.html |title=The Better Call Saul Music Video Is a Great Advertisement, but a Better Song |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |date=2014-10-05 |access-date=2016-08-14}}</ref> On May 24, 2018, Brown released his 11th album, ''Deep in the Heart Of Me''.\n\nOn October 6, 2019, Junior Brown's \"guit-steel\" guitar, along with his wife's Shenandoah acoustic guitar, was reported as stolen from a vehicle parked at a hotel in [[North Attleboro]], Massachusetts near [[Providence, Rhode Island]].
