He has released six major-label studio albums and a greatest hits package, on [[Mercury Records]] and [[Capitol Records]]. His comedy act typically combines stand-up comedy and original songs. Most of his songs are performed in a [[neotraditional country]] style, with Carrington handling lead vocals and guitar. Carrington has also starred in the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] sitcom ''[[Rodney (TV series)|Rodney]]'' and in the 2008 film ''[[Beer for My Horses (film)|Beer for My Horses]]''.\n\n== Early life ==\nRodney Carrington was born in [[Longview, Texas]], in 1968, and lived there until 1990.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.kilgore.edu/contentdetail.asp?ContentID=330|title=ABC star Rodney Carrington to address KC students|publisher=[[Kilgore College]]|access-date=December 19, 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527231620/http://www.kilgore.edu/contentdetail.asp?ContentID=330|archive-date=May 27, 2010}}</ref> He worked as a comedian in local venues, gaining exposure through radio programs such as ''[[The Bob and Tom Show]]''.\n\n== Career ==\nCarrington's first album, ''Hangin' with Rodney'', was released in 1998 via [[Mercury Records Nashville]]. This album, consisting of both stand-up comedy and original songs, contained the non-charting single \"Letter to My Penis\" and peaked at No.&nbsp;73 on [[Top Country Albums]].\n\nHe moved to [[Capitol Nashville]] for his next album, 2000's ''Morning Wood''. It was his first Top 20 album on the US Country charts, first Gold-certified recording,{{Certification Cite Ref|region=United States|type=album|title=Morning Wood|artist=Rodney Carrington}} and it brought him to the singles charts for the first time with \"More of a Man\", which reached No.&nbsp;71 on Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now [[Hot Country Songs]]). After it came the live album ''Live: C'mon Laugh You Bastards'', which did not chart. Carrington's third release for Capitol was 2003's ''Nut Sack''. It mostly consisted of studio-recorded comedy songs and only featured five stand-up sketches. It included the single \"Don't Look Now\" which reached No.&nbsp;60. The album also featured a new version of \"Letter to My Penis\", which was recorded in a jazz-swing style.\n\nA ''[[Greatest Hits (Rodney Carrington album)|Greatest Hits]]'' package followed in 2004. This album comprised selections from his Capitol recordings on two discs: stand-up routines on one disc, and songs on the other. It also included two previously unreleased songs: \"Put Your Clothes Back On\" and his first non-comedy song, \"Things We Didn't Know.\" This compilation album reached No. 3 on the ''Billboard'' Top Comedy Albums chart and No. 11 on the ''Billboard'' Top Country albums chart, becoming Carrington's first Platinum-certified recording.{{Certification Cite Ref|region=United States|type=album|title=Greatest Hits|artist=Rodney Carrington}} \n\nAlso in 2004, Carrington made his acting debut in ''[[Rodney (TV series)|Rodney]]'', a [[sitcom]] based largely on his own life which aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] for two seasons.<ref name=\"allmusic\" /> He released ''King of the Mountains'' in 2007. In addition to reaching No. 2 on the US Comedy Albums chart and No. 15 on the US Country chart, ''King of the Mountains'' reached No. 68 on the US ''[[Billboard 200]]'' pop albums chart, the highest-ever peak position for any of his recordings. ''King of the Mountains'' contains his second serious song, \"Angel Friend\", a tribute to his best friend Barry Martin, who died suddenly in 2003.\n\nIn 2008 he appeared in the film ''[[Beer for My Horses (film)|Beer for My Horses]]'', which also starred [[Toby Keith]].\n\nCarrington released his sixth studio album ''El Niño Loco'' in 2009. Unlike his previous releases, ''El Niño Loco'' does not feature any stand-up sketches. It also contains his third non-comedy song \"Funny Man\".\n\nLater in 2009, Carrington released his first Christmas album, ''Make It Christmas''. The album was his final release for Capitol Records. The first single from the album, a non-comedy tribute to soldiers stationed abroad called \"Camouflage and Christmas Lights\", became his first Top 40 country hit in December 2009.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2007-09-24-rodney-carrington-Q&A_N.htm?loc=interstitialskip | work=USA Today | title=Services}}</ref>\n\nCarrington has released two more comedy albums on the independent label Laughter's Good Records: ''Laughter's Good'' (2014) and ''Here Comes the Truth'' (2017).
