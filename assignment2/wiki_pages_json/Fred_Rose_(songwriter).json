In his teens, he moved to [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] where he worked in bars [[busking]] for tips, and finally [[vaudeville]]. He became successful as a songwriter, penning his first hit for entertainer [[Sophie Tucker]].\n\nRose lived in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], but his radio show there did not last long and he went [[New York City|New York City's]] [[Tin Pan Alley]] to be a songwriter. He wrote songs with [[Raymond Otis Whitley|Ray Whitley]], an RKO B-Western film star and author of \"[[Back in the Saddle Again]]\", a collaboration that introduced Rose to [[country music]]. He lived for a time with Ray and Kay Whitley in an apartment in Hollywood, co-writing many tunes for Ray's movies.\n\nIn 1942, Rose returned to Nashville and teamed with [[Grand Ole Opry]] star [[Roy Acuff]] to create the first Nashville-based music publishing company.<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> Their [[Acuff-Rose Music]] was almost immediately successful, particularly with the enormous hits of client [[Hank Williams]].<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> Acuff-Rose Music remained a foundation of the country music business even after Rose's death; his son, [[Wesley Rose]], took over the presidency and continued with Roy Acuff until 1985, when the company's catalog was sold to [[Gaylord Entertainment Company]], parent company of the Grand Ole Opry.\n\nRose served as Hank Williams' record producer throughout his career, 1947-1953.<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/>\n\nWhile running the business, Rose continued to write numerous country songs and eventually became one of the industry's most important personalities. He also wrote songs under the name Floyd Jenkins.<ref name=\"CG\">Atkins, Chet and Neely, Bill. (1974). \"Country Gentleman\". Chicago.

He was inducted into the [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 1970 and into the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 1985. In 1986, son Wesley would join his father in the Country Music Hall of Fame.\n\n==Selected list of Fred Rose songs==\n* \"A Pair of Broken Hearts\" (Rose/[[Jenny Lou Carson|Carson]]) – [[Hank Snow]]\n* \"[[At Mail Call Today]]\" (Rose/Autry) – [[Gene Autry]]\n* \"[[Be Honest with Me]]\" (Rose/Autry) – [[Gene Autry]]\n* \"[[Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain]]\" (Rose) – [[Roy Acuff]], [[Willie Nelson]], [[Olivia Newton-John]], [[Hank Williams]] (on Mothers Best Show), [[Alain Bashung]]\n* \"Blue Love (In My Heart)\" (Floyd Jenkins) – Hank Williams \n* \"[[Charlestonette]]\" (Rose/[[Paul Whiteman|Whiteman]]) – [[Paul Whiteman]] and His Orchestra\n* \"Crazy Heart\" (Rose/Maurice Murray) – Hank Williams\n* \"[['Deed I Do]]\" (Rose/Walter Hirsch) – [[Sophie Tucker]]\n* \"Deep Henderson\" (Rose) – [[Joe \"King\" Oliver]], [[The Ipana Troubadors]], [[Coon-Sanders Original Nighthawk Orchestra]]\n* \"Deep Water (Rose) – [[Bob Wills]], [[Carl Smith (country musician)|Carl Smith]], [[George Strait]], [[Don Everly]]\n* \"Dreaming the Waltz Away\" (Rose/Whiteman) – [[Jesse Crawford]]\n* \"Faded Love and Winter Roses\" (Rose) – Carl Smith,  [[Hank Williams]], [[David Houston (singer)|David Houston]]\n* \"Fireball Mail\" (Floyd Jenkins) – Roy Acuff, [[Wanda Jackson]]\n* \"[[Flamin' Mamie]]\" (Rose/Whiteman) – Coon-Sanders Orchestra, [[Aileen Stanley]]\n* \"Foggy River\" (Rose) – [[Moon Mullican]], [[Red Foley]], Carl Smith\n* \"Hang Your Head in Shame\" (Rose/Ed G.
