Between 1989 and 1994, and again from 2000 to 2002, McBride was the lead vocalist and [[bass guitar]]ist in the band [[McBride & the Ride]], a country music group which recorded four studio albums, received CMA and ACM Nominations for Vocal Group of the Year, and charted more than ten singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts. The trio reunited a second time in 2021 and is currently touring throughout the country in support of their comeback EP, ''Marlboros & Avon''. McBride continues to write and record solo music as well, including albums ''Hotels & Highways'' and ''Rebels & Angels''. He is also the son of 1970s country singer [[Dale McBride]].<ref name=\"still\">{{cite web |url=http://www.stillworkingmusic.com/terrymcbride.htm |title=Terry McBride |accessdate=2008-04-30 |work=Still Working Music}}</ref> \n\n== McBride & The Ride ==\nIn 1989, record producer [[Tony Brown (record producer)]] introduced McBride to guitarist Ray Herndon and drummer Billy Thomas at CMA Fan Fair in Nashville, Tennessee. Together, the trio record McBride & The Ride's debut album [[Burnin' Up the Road]] which featured five singles including \"[[Same Old Star]]\" and \"[[Can I Count On You]]\". \n\nFollowing the success of their debut record, the band went back to the studio in 1992 to record their sophomore record, [[Sacred Ground (McBride & the Ride album)]]. It produced three singles for the trio, all of which were Top Five hits on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) charts: \"Just One Night\", \"Going out of My Mind\", and \"Sacred Ground\", which was originally recorded by Kix Brooks (of Brooks & Dunn) on his self-titled debut album. Also included on this album is a cover of \"All I Have to Offer You Is Me\", originally recorded by Charley Pride. The album has also been certified gold by the RIAA.\n\n1993 saw the release of [[Hurry Sundown (McBride & the Ride album)]]. Released on MCA Records, it produced the hit singles \"Love on the Loose, Heart on the Run\" and the title track, which peaked at #3 and #17, respectively, on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks. \n\nIn 1994, the label removed Herndon and Thomas from the group, which was renamed Terry McBride & the Ride. McBride remained lead singer, while the other members were replaced with Keith Edwards (drums), Kenny Vaughan (electric guitar), Gary Morse (steel guitar), Jeff Roach (keyboards), and Randy Frazier (bass guitar). Roach and Vaughan were respectively replaced by Rick Gerken and Bob Britt shortly before their fourth album (1994's [[Terry McBride & the Ride]]), after which McBride & the Ride disbanded.\n\nIn September 2000, Herndon reunited with McBride and Thomas after meeting them at a party at the Handlebar-J Restaurant & Bar in Scottsdale, Arizona, to celebrate the club's 25th anniversary. After they performed \"No More Cryin'\" there, Herndon suggested that they officially reunite as McBride & the Ride. The trio recorded demo tapes and began searching for a record deal, signing to the independent Dualtone Records in 2002. Working with record producer Matt Rollings, McBride & the Ride recorded its only album for Dualtone, titled [[Amarillo Sky (album)]], and released it in September of that year.\n\nMcBride, Herndon, and Thomas reformed McBride & the Ride a second time in late 2021. In February 2022, the band had their first Nashville concert in 20 years. On November 4, 2022, the band released a new single titled \"Marlboros & Avon\". This was followed in March 2023 by a second single titled \"Along Comes a Girl\". Both of these songs will be included on an extended play also titled Along Comes a Girl, slated for release later in the year.\n\n== Solo career ==\nAfter McBride & the Ride disbanded in 1995, he found work as a songwriter, with country duo [[Brooks & Dunn]] recording more than two dozen of his songs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iacmusic.com/artist.aspx?id=26622 |title=McBride & the Ride |accessdate=2008-04-30 |work=IAC Music}}</ref> This figure includes the Number One hits \"[[If You See Him/If You See Her]]\" (recorded with [[Reba McEntire]],) and \"[[Play Something Country]]\". In addition, McBride co-wrote [[Josh Gracin]]'s 2005 single \"[[Stay with Me (Brass Bed)]]\".<ref name=\"still\"/> For his contributions as a songwriter, McBride has won 12 awards from [[Broadcast Music Incorporated]].<ref name=\"still\"/>\n\nMcBride also co-wrote [[Reba McEntire]]'s 2010 single \"[[I Keep On Loving You]]\", [[Casey James]]' 2011 single \"[[Let's Don't Call It a Night]]\" and several tracks on former Brooks & Dunn member [[Ronnie Dunn]]'s debut album.\n\nIn 2017, McBride released his first solo record, an extended play titled ''Hotels & Highways''.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/country/7702234/terry-mcbride-hotels-highways-new-ep-return|title=Terry McBride to Return with New EP 'Hotels & Highways'|last=Dauphin|first=Chuck|magazine=Billboard|accessdate=19 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 2020, McBride released the album, ''Rebels & Angels'', including 9 songs.\n\nIn 2021, McBride co-wrote several songs with country artist [[Drake Milligan]], including \"Sounds Like Something I'd Do\", \"Tipping Point\", and \"Cowboy Kind of Way\", all of which would appear on Milligan's debut LP, [[Dallas/Fort Worth (album)]]. \n\nOn February 24, 2024, the Texas Heritage Songwriters Association inducted McBride into the Texas Songwriters Hall of Fame alongside Eric Johnson, Jack Ingram, Jon Randall, and Ruthie Foster.\n\n==Discography==\n===Terry McBride===\n* ''Hotels & Highways'' (2017)\n* ''Rebels & Angels'' (2020)\n\n===McBride & the Ride===\n* ''[[Burnin' Up the Road]]'' (1990)\n*
