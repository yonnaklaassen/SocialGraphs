He sold appliances while studying to be a radio announcer. At night, he played with guitarist [[Luther Perkins]] and bassist [[Marshall Grant]]. Perkins and Grant were known as the [[The Tennessee Three|Tennessee Two]]. Cash worked up the courage to visit the [[Sun Records]] studio, hoping to get a recording contract.<ref>{{cite web|title= Johnny Cash Biography and Interview |website=Achievement.org|publisher=[[American Academy of Achievement]]|url= https://www.achievement.org/achiever/johnny-cash/#interview}}</ref> He auditioned for [[Sam Phillips]] by singing mostly gospel songs, only to learn from the producer that he no longer recorded gospel music. Phillips was rumored to have told Cash to \"go home and sin, then come back with a song I can sell\". In a 2002 interview, Cash denied that Phillips made any such comment.<ref>{{Citation|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=832786|title=The Man in Black's Musical Journey Continues|newspaper=NPR|access-date=February 9, 2010}}</ref> Cash eventually won over the producer with new songs delivered in his early rockabilly style. In 1955, Cash made his first recordings at Sun, \"[[Hey Porter]]\" and \"[[Cry! Cry! Cry!]]\", which were released in late June and met with success on the country [[hit parade]].\n\nOn December 4, 1956, [[Elvis Presley]] dropped in on Phillips while [[Carl Perkins]] was in the studio cutting new tracks, with [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] backing him on piano. Cash was also in the studio, and the four started an [[impromptu]] [[jam session]]. Phillips left the tapes running and the recordings, almost half of which were gospel songs, survived. They have since been released under the title ''[[Million Dollar Quartet]]''. In ''Cash: the Autobiography'', Cash wrote that he was the farthest from the microphone and sang in a higher pitch to blend in with Elvis.\n\nCash's next record, \"Folsom Prison Blues\", made the country top five. His \"[[I Walk the Line]]\" became number one on the country charts and entered the pop charts top 20. \"[[Home of the Blues]]\" followed, recorded in July 1957. That same year, Cash became the first Sun artist to release a [[LP record|long-playing album]]. Although he was Sun's most consistently selling and prolific artist at that time, Cash felt constrained by his contract with the small label. Phillips did not want Cash to record gospel and was paying him a 3% royalty rather than the standard rate of 5%. Presley had already left Sun, and Cash felt that Phillips was focusing most of his attention and promotion on Lewis.\n\nIn 1958, Cash left Phillips to sign a lucrative offer with [[Columbia Records]]. His single \"[[Don't Take Your Guns to Town]]\" became one of his biggest hits. He recorded a collection of gospel songs for his second album for Columbia. However, Cash left behind such a backlog of recordings with Sun that Phillips continued to release new singles and albums featuring previously unreleased material until as late as 1964. Cash was in the unusual position of having new releases out on two labels concurrently. Sun's 1960 release, a cover of \"[[Oh Lonesome Me]]\", made it to number 13 on the C&W charts.{{Efn|When [[RCA Victor]] signed Presley, it had also bought his Sun Records masters, but when Cash departed for Columbia, Phillips retained the rights to the singer's Sun masters. Columbia eventually licensed some of these recordings for release on compilations after Cash's death.}}\n[[File:Johnny Cash - Cash Box 1957.jpg|thumb|Cash on the cover of ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cash Box]]'' magazine, September 7, 1957]]\nEarly in his career, Cash was given the teasing nickname \"the Undertaker\" by fellow artists because of his habit of wearing black clothes. He said he chose them because they were easier to keep looking clean on long tours.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-johnny-cash-20131031|title=10 Things you didn't know about Johnny Cash|magazine=Rolling Stone|access-date=August 29, 2014|date=October 31, 2013|archive-date=October 16, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016134501/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-johnny-cash-20131031|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 1960s, Cash toured with the Carter Family, which by this time regularly included [[Maybelle Carter|Mother Maybelle]]'s daughters, [[Anita Carter|Anita]], June, and [[Helen Carter|Helen]]. June later recalled admiring him from afar during these tours. In the 1960s, he appeared on [[Pete Seeger]]'s short-lived television series ''[[Rainbow Quest]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.richardandmimi.com/rainbowquest.html|title=Rainbow Quest|website=Richardandmimi.com|date=February 26, 1966|access-date=August 1, 2012}}</ref> He also acted in, and wrote and sang the opening theme for, a 1961 film entitled ''[[Five Minutes to Live]]''. It was later re-released as ''Door-to-door Maniac''.\n\nCash's career was handled by [[Saul Holiff]], a [[London, Ontario]], promoter. Their relationship was the subject of Saul's son's biopic ''[[My Father and the Man in Black]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://johnny-and-saul.com|title=My Father and The Man in Black|website=Johnny-and-saul.com|access-date=April 25, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517093414/http://johnny-and-saul.com/|archive-date=May 17, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== Outlaw image ===\nAs his career was taking off in the late 1950s, Cash started drinking heavily and became addicted to [[amphetamine]]s and [[barbiturate]]s. For a brief time, he shared an apartment in Nashville with [[Waylon Jennings]], who was deeply addicted to amphetamines. Cash would use the stimulants to stay awake during tours. Friends joked about his \"nervousness\" and erratic behavior, many ignoring the warning signs of his worsening [[drug addiction]].\n\nAlthough he was in many ways spiraling out of control, Cash could still deliver hits due to his frenetic creativity. His rendition of \"[[Ring of Fire (song)|Ring of Fire]]\" was a [[crossover (music)|crossover]] hit, reaching number one on the country charts and entering the top 20 on the pop charts. It was originally performed by [[June Carter]]'s sister, but the signature [[mariachi]]-style horn arrangement was provided by Cash.<ref name=pc10>{{Pop Chronicles|10|3}}</ref> He said that it had come to him in a dream. \n\nHis first wife Vivian (Liberto) Cash claimed a different version of the origins of \"Ring of Fire\". In her book, ''I Walked the Line: My Life with Johnny'' (2007), Liberto says that Cash gave Carter half the songwriting credit for monetary reasons.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cash |first1=Vivian |last2=Sharpsteen |first2=Ann |title=I Walked the Line: My Life with Johnny |date=2007 |publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]] |isbn=978-1416532927 |page=294 |edition=Hardcover |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TmkBUE0f3HAC&pg=PA294 |access-date=February 28, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1965, Cash's camper caught fire during a fishing trip with his nephew Damon Fielder in [[Los Padres National Forest]] in California.

Despite landing in jail seven times for [[misdemeanor]]s, he was held only one night each time. On May 11, 1965, he was arrested in [[Starkville, Mississippi]], for [[trespassing]] late at night onto private property to pick flowers. (He used this incident as the basis for the song \"Starkville City Jail\". He discussed this on his live ''At San Quentin'' album.)<ref>Johnny Cash, ''[[At San Quentin]]'', [[Columbia Records]] CS 9827, 1969</ref> \n\nWhile on tour later that year, he was arrested October 4 in [[El Paso, Texas]], by a [[narcotic]]s squad. The officers suspected he was [[smuggling]] [[heroin]] from Mexico, but found instead 688 [[Dexedrine]] capsules (amphetamines) and 475 [[Meprobamate|Equanil]] (sedatives or tranquilizers) tablets hidden inside his guitar case. Because the pills were prescription drugs rather than illegal narcotics, Cash received a [[suspended sentence]]. He posted a $1,500 bond and was released until his arraignment.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2013/oct/12/entertainment/la-et-ms-johnny-cash-calif/3|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219065356/http://articles.latimes.com/2013/oct/12/entertainment/la-et-ms-johnny-cash-calif/3|url-status=dead|archive-date=December 19, 2013|title=Johnny Cash's dark California days|last=Hilburn|first=Robert|date=October 12, 2013|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=November 8, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}</ref>\n\nIn this period of the mid-1960s, Cash released a number of [[concept album]]s. His ''[[Bitter Tears]]'' (1964) was devoted to spoken word and songs addressing the plight of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] and mistreatment by the government. While initially reaching charts, this album met with resistance from some fans and radio stations, which rejected its controversial take on social issues. \n\nIn 2011, a book was published about it, leading to a re-recording of the songs by contemporary artists and the making of a documentary film about Cash's efforts with the album. This film was aired on PBS in February and November 2016. His ''[[Sings the Ballads of the True West]]'' (1965) was an experimental double record, mixing authentic frontier songs with Cash's spoken narration.\n\nReaching a low with his severe drug addiction and destructive behavior, Cash and his first wife divorced after having separated in 1962. Some venues cancelled his performances, but he continued to find success. In 1967, Cash's duet with June Carter, \"[[Jackson (song)|Jackson]]\", won a [[Grammy Award]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.com/nominees/search?artist=%22johnny+cash%22&field_nominee_work_value=&year=All&genre=All/|title=Past Winners Search|work=The GRAMMYs|date=April 30, 2017}}</ref>\n\nCash was last arrested in 1967 in [[Walker County, Georgia]], after police found he was carrying a bag of prescription pills when in a car accident. Cash attempted to bribe a local deputy, who turned the money down. He was jailed for the night in [[LaFayette, Georgia]]. Sheriff Ralph Jones released him after giving him a long talk, warning him about the danger of his behavior and wasted potential. Cash credited that experience with helping him turn around and save his life. He later returned to LaFayette to play a benefit concert; it attracted 12,000 people (the city population was less than 9,000 at the time) and raised $75,000 for the high school.<ref>{{Citation|page=5A|place=LaFayette, Georgia|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KtkvAAAAIBAJ&pg=3615,6191621|newspaper=Rome News Tribune|date=August 14, 1970|title=12 000 at LaFayette show}}</ref> \n\nReflecting on his past in a 1997 interview, Cash noted: \"I was taking the pills for awhile, and then the pills started taking me.\"<ref>Gross (2004). p. 34</ref> June, Maybelle, and Ezra Carter moved into Cash's mansion for a month to help him get off drugs. Cash proposed onstage to June on February 22, 1968, at a concert at the [[London Gardens]] in London, Ontario, Canada. The couple married a week later (on March 1) in [[Franklin, Kentucky]]. She had agreed to marry Cash after he had \"cleaned up.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Zwonitzer|first=Mark|title=Will You Miss Me When I'm Gone: The Carter Family and Their Legacy in American Music|url=https://archive.org/details/willyoumissmewhe0000zwon|url-access=registration|publisher=Simon & Schuster |year= 2002|isbn= 978-0-684-85763-3}}</ref>\n\nCash's journey included rediscovery of his Christian faith. He took an \"[[altar call]]\" in Evangel Temple, a small church in the Nashville area, pastored by Reverend Jimmie Rodgers Snow, son of country music legend [[Hank Snow]]. According to [[Marshall Grant]], though, Cash did not completely stop using amphetamines in 1968; and did not fully end drug use for another two years. He was drug-free for a period of seven years. In his memoir about time with Cash, Grant said that the birth of Cash's son, [[John Carter Cash]], inspired the singer to end his dependence.<ref name=\"Grant page 92\">{{cite book|last=Grant|first=Marshall|title=I Was There When It Happened&nbsp;– My Life With Johnny Cash|pages=[https://archive.org/details/iwastherewhenith00mars/page/92 92, 177]|publisher=Cumberland House|year=2005|isbn=978-1-58182-510-7|url=https://archive.org/details/iwastherewhenith00mars/page/92}}</ref>\n\nCash began using amphetamines again in 1977. By 1983, he was deeply addicted again. He entered rehab at the [[Betty Ford Clinic]] in [[Rancho Mirage, California|Rancho Mirage]] for treatment. He stayed off drugs for several years, but relapsed. \n\nIn 1989, he entered Nashville's Cumberland Heights Alcohol and Drug Treatment Center. In 1992, he started care at the Loma Linda Behavioral Medicine Center in [[Loma Linda, California]], for his final rehabilitation treatment.

He played his first notable prison concert on January 1, 1958, at [[San Quentin State Prison]] in California.<ref name=\"cash1958\">[http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/inmate-merle-haggard-hears-johnny-cash-play-san-quentin-state-prison \"Inmate Merle Haggard hears Johnny Cash play San Quentin State Prison\"], history.com; accessed June 24, 2014.</ref> These performances were recorded live, and released on highly successful albums: ''[[At Folsom Prison|Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison]]'' (1968) and ''[[At San Quentin|Johnny Cash at San Quentin]]'' (1969). Both live albums reached number one on ''Billboard'' country album music and the latter crossed over to reach the top of the ''Billboard'' pop album chart. In 1969, Cash became an international hit when he eclipsed even [[The Beatles]] by selling 6.5&nbsp;million albums.<ref>Edwards, Leigh H. \"Cash, Johnny.\" Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online. Oxford University Press.</ref> In comparison, the prison concerts were much more successful than his later live albums such as ''Strawberry Cake'' recorded in London and ''Live at Madison Square Garden'', which peaked at numbers 33 and 39 on the album charts, respectively.\n\nThe [[Folsom State Prison|Folsom Prison]] record was introduced by a rendition of his \"Folsom Prison Blues\", while the [[San Quentin]] record included the crossover hit single \"[[A Boy Named Sue]]\", a [[Shel Silverstein]] novelty song that reached number one on the country charts and number two on the U.S. [[Top 40|top-10]] pop charts.\n\nIn 1972 Cash performed at the [[Österåker Prison]] in Sweden. The live album ''[[På Österåker]]'' (''At Österåker'') was released in 1973. \"San Quentin\" was recorded with Cash replacing \"San Quentin\" with \"Österåker\". In 1976, a concert at [[Tennessee State Prison]] was videotaped for TV broadcast. It was posthumously released after Cash's death as a CD entitled ''[[A Concert Behind Prison Walls]]''.\n\n=== Activism for Native Americans ===\nCash used his stardom and economic status to bring awareness to the issues surrounding the Native American people.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Johnny Cash and the paradox of American Identity|last=Edwards|first=Leigh|publisher=Bloomington : Indiana University Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-253-35292-7}}</ref> Cash sang songs about indigenous humanity in an effort to confront the U.S. government.

Cash wrote three of the songs himself and one with the help of [[Johnny Horton]]. \n\nThe majority of these protest songs were written by folk artist [[Peter La Farge]] (son of [[Oliver La Farge]], an activist and Pulitzer prizewinner.) Cash met the younger La Farge in New York in the 1960s and admired him for his activism.<ref>{{cite web|date=1965|title=Johnny Cash and June Carter (Television series episode). In Rainbow Quest.

In the mid-1980s, he recorded and toured with [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Willie Nelson]], and [[Kris Kristofferson]] as [[The Highwaymen (country supergroup)|the Highwaymen]], making three hit albums, which were released beginning with the originally titled ''Highwayman'' in 1985, followed by ''Highwaymen 2'' in 1990, and concluding with ''Highwaymen&nbsp;– The Road Goes On Forever'' in 1995.\n\nDuring that period, Cash appeared in a number of television films. In 1981, he starred in ''[[The Pride of Jesse Hallam]]'', winning fine reviews for a film that called attention to adult [[illiteracy]]. In 1983, he appeared as a heroic sheriff in ''[[Murder in Coweta County (film)|Murder in Coweta County]]'', based on a real-life [[Murder in Coweta County|Georgia murder]] case, which co-starred [[Andy Griffith]] as his nemesis.\n\nCash relapsed into addiction after being administered painkillers for a serious abdominal injury in 1983 caused by an incident in which he was kicked and wounded by an [[ostrich]] on his farm.<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.exclaim.ca/index.asp?layid=22&csid=1&csid1=439|title=Johnny Cash: The Rebel|website=Exclaim.ca|place=Canada|page=3|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050426225724/http://www.exclaim.ca/index.asp?layid=22&csid=1&csid1=439|archive-date=April 26, 2005}}</ref>\n\nAt a hospital visit in 1988, this time to watch over Waylon Jennings (who was recovering from a heart attack), Jennings suggested that Cash have himself checked into the hospital for his own heart condition. Doctors recommended preventive heart surgery, and Cash underwent [[coronary artery bypass surgery|double bypass surgery]] in the same hospital. Both recovered, although Cash refused to use any prescription painkillers, fearing a relapse into dependency. Cash later claimed that during his operation, he had what is called a \"[[near-death experience]]\".\n\n{{Anchor|Chicken in Black}}\nIn 1984, Cash released a self-parody recording titled \"[[The Chicken in Black]]\" about Cash's brain being transplanted into a chicken and Cash receiving a bank robber's brain in return. Biographer Robert Hilburn, in his 2013 book ''Johnny Cash: The Life'', disputes the claim made that Cash chose to record an intentionally poor song in protest of Columbia's treatment of him. On the contrary, Hilburn writes, it was Columbia that presented Cash with the song, which Cash – who had previously scored major chart hits with comedic material such as \"A Boy Named Sue\" and \"One Piece at a Time\" – accepted enthusiastically, performing the song live on stage and filming a comedic music video in which he dresses up in a superhero-like bank-robber costume. According to Hilburn, Cash's enthusiasm for the song waned after Waylon Jennings told Cash he looked \"like a buffoon\" in the music video (which was showcased during Cash's 1984 Christmas TV special), and Cash subsequently demanded that Columbia withdraw the music video from broadcast and recall the single from stores—interrupting its bona fide chart success—and termed the venture \"a fiasco\".<ref>Robert Hilburn, ''Johnny Cash: The Life''.

He recorded ''Johnny Cash Reads The Complete [[New Testament]]'' in 1990.\n\n=== ''American Recordings'' ===\n[[File:Johnny Cash sings a duet with a Navy lieutenant.jpg|thumb|Johnny Cash sings with a Navy lieutenant during a military event {{circa}} January 1987]]\nAfter Columbia Records dropped Cash from his recording contract, he had a short and unsuccessful stint with [[Mercury Records]] from 1987 to 1991. During this time, he recorded an album of new versions of some of his best-known Sun and Columbia hits, as well as ''[[Water from the Wells of Home]]'', a duets album that paired him with, among others, his children [[Rosanne Cash]] and [[John Carter Cash]], as well as [[Paul McCartney]]. A [[Johnny Cash Country Christmas|one-off Christmas album]] recorded for [[Delta Records]] followed his Mercury contract.\n\nThough Cash would never have another chart hit from 1991 until his death, his career was rejuvenated in the 1990s, leading to popularity with an audience which was not traditionally considered interested in country music. In 1988, British post-punk musicians [[Marc Riley]] (formerly of [[The Fall (band)|the Fall]]) and [[Jon Langford]] ([[the Mekons]]) put together '''Til Things Are Brighter'', a [[tribute album]] featuring mostly British-based indie-rock acts' interpretations of Cash's songs. Cash was enthusiastic about the project, telling Langford that it was a \"morale booster\"; Rosanne Cash later said \"he felt a real connection with those musicians and very validated ... It was very good for him: he was in his element. He absolutely understood what they were tapping into, and loved it\".
