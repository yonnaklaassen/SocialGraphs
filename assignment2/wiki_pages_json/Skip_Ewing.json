Active since 1988, Ewing has recorded nine studio albums and has charted 15 singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country charts.\n\n==Career==\nEwing was born in [[Redlands, California]], United States. He first began to gain national attention during the mid-1980s, both as a songwriter and recording artist for [[MCA Records|MCA]] and [[Capitol Records]]. His 1988 debut, ''The Coast of Colorado'', produced the number 3 hit \"[[Burnin' a Hole in My Heart]]\" and four other top 20 country hits. ''The Will to Love'' included the top 5 hit \"It's You Again\". Although none of Ewing's subsequent chart entries made the Top 40, he released eight more albums from 1990 to 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/skip-ewing-mn0000015072|title=Skip Ewing biography|last=Huey|first=Steve|work=Allmusic|access-date=February 11, 2013}}</ref>\n\nEwing is a notable attendee of [[Columbine High School]] in [[Jefferson County, Colorado|Jefferson County]], Colorado, and [[Redlands High School]] in [[Redlands, California]].\n\nIn 1990, Ewing wrote two songs for [[Kenny Rogers]]' album ''[[Love Is Strange (album)|Love Is Strange]]'': \"Listen to the Rain\" and \"If I Were a Painting\".\n\nIn 2008, he served as the duet partner of the radio version of [[Reba McEntire]]'s single, \"Every Other Weekend\". He also co-wrote the single; the song reached the Top 20 on the Billboard Country Chart. Although the song was credited for one week to Ewing and [[Kenny Chesney]] as \"\"Every Other Weekend\" by Reba McEntire and Skip Ewing or Kenny Chesney\", the song was thereafter credited to McEntire alone on the chart.\n\n== Awards ==\n* [[Broadcast Music Incorporated]] (BMI) Songwriter of the Year 2000;\n* Nashville Songwriters Association International (NSAI) Song of the Year;\n* [[Country Music Association]] (CMA) Triple Play Award (three No.&nbsp;1 songs within 12 months).\n\nAdditionally, Ewing has received a CMA Song of the Year nomination, a Grammy nomination, a Tony nomination and multiple BMI \"Million Air\" awards.\n\n== Horse and Writer ==\nHorse and Writer is an annual songwriting retreat Skip Ewing organizes every year with members of the [[Nashville]] songwriting community. The retreat lasts six days, and takes place at the Triangle C Ranch in [[Dubois, Wyoming]]. The mission is to help aspiring songwriters realize their potential, as they are mentored by experienced pros like Ewing, who describes the event as \"a labor of love.\"\n\n==Discography==\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:18em;\"| Title\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:18em;\"| Album details\n!
