Remembered mostly for her deep, distinctive, mature singing voice, she was the lead singer on most of the recordings of the historic [[Carter Family]] act in the 1920s and 1930s. In her earliest recordings her voice was pitched very high.<ref name=\"Zwonitzer\">{{cite book|last=Zwonitzer|first=Mark|author2=Hirshberg, Charles|title=Will You Miss Me When I'm Gone?: The Carter Family & Their Legacy in American Music|publisher=Simon & Schuster|year=2004|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qTdns8tiSqUC&q=Will+You+Miss+Me+When+I'm+Gone%3F+The+Carter+Family+%26+Their+Legacy+in+American+Music|isbn=0-7432-4382-X}}</ref>\n\n== Life and career ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2016}}\nBorn in [[Copper Creek, Virginia]], the daughter of William Sevier Dougherty and Nancy Elizabeth Kilgore, at age 16 she married [[A. P. Carter]] on June 18, 1915; they divorced in 1936.<ref name=\"Zwonitzer\"/> They had three children: Gladys (Mrs. Millard), [[Janette Carter|Janette]] (Mrs. Jett), and [[Joseph Dougherty Carter|Joe]].<ref name=\"Zwonitzer\"/>\n\nIn 1927, she and A. P. began performing as the [[Carter Family]], perhaps the first commercial rural country music group. They were joined by her cousin, [[Maybelle Carter|Maybelle]], who was married to A. P.'s brother, [[Ezra Carter]]. Later, Sara married Coy Bayes, A. P.'s first cousin, and moved to California in 1943, and the original group disbanded. In the late 1940s, Maybelle began performing with her daughters [[Helen Carter|Helen]], [[June Carter Cash|June]], and [[Anita Carter|Anita]] as The Carter Sisters and Mother Maybelle (the act was renamed The Carter Family during the 1960s).<ref>{{Cite book |last=Wolfe |first=Charles K. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tFWSAgAAQBAJ |title=Classic Country: Legends of Country Music |date=2002-05-03 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-135-95734-6 |page=17 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nOn Carter Family recordings, Sara is credited as author of the songs \"Fifty Miles of Elbow Room\" and \"Keep on the Firing Line\"; in truth she discovered these [[public domain]] songs when they were being sung at a [[Seventh-day Adventist]] church she visited.\n\nRCA gave her songwriter credit, as it did A.P. Carter on his public domain discoveries. The Carter Family recordings of these tunes brought the songs worldwide fame. Sara wrote or co-wrote several other songs, including \"My Foothills Home\", \"The Dying Soldier\", \"Lonesome Pine Special\", \"Farther On\", and \"Railroading on the Great Divide\".\n\nSara reunited with Maybelle in 1966 for a Columbia Records album titled \"An Historic Reunion,\" which was later re-issued on Bear Family Records, with additional songs, as \"Sara and Maybelle Carter.\" They performed together during the folk music craze of the 1960s at the Newport Folk Festival.<ref name=\"Zwonitzer\"/> The duo were featured as guests in a late 1960s episode of [[the Wilburn Brothers]] television show, singing \"Little Moses\" and \"As the Band Played Dixie\". Following this period, Sara retired to California,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Carter_Sara_1898-1979|title=Carter, Sara (1898–1979)|last=Lornell|first=Kip|website=Encyclopedia Virginia|access-date=2016-05-04}}</ref> although she and Maybelle remained close for the rest of their lives and Sara and Coy journeyed yearly from California to Virginia by car, pulling a travel trailer.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Sara and Maybelle reunited to appear on [[Johnny Cash]]'s network television show and to perform together at the first annual A.P. Carter Memorial Festival in [[Hiltons, Virginia]].\n\n== Family tree==\n{{Tree chart/start|align=center|summary=Carter Family Tree}}\n{{Tree chart| | | | | | | | | | | W.K. |~|y|~| NAK | |W.K.=William Kilgore|NAK=Nancy Kilgore}}\n{{Tree chart| | | | | | | | | | | | | ||)|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|.| }}\n{{Tree chart| | | | | | | |H.J.A. |~|y|~| M.E.K. | | | | | | | | N.E.K. |~|y|~| W.S.D. | | H.J.A.=Hugh J.
