It was his final release on the New Door label.\n\n====Launch of Aimless Records====\nIn 2008, Snider launched his own independent record label, Aimless Records. The label's first release was his eight-song EP ''[[Peace Queer]]'', the most political record of his career. The title was inspired by the ’60s avant garde rock band [[The Fugs]] who had a line about killing \"peace queers.\"<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.jambase.com/article/todd-snider-is-so-queer |title= Todd Snider Is So Queer |last= Cook |first= Dennis |date= October 23, 2008 |website= Jambase |publisher= |access-date= August 13, 2021 }}</ref> As Snider tells it in the press bio for the album, he was kidnapped by an international league of peace queers who forced him to write the protest songs that appeared on the record. Three of the tracks on the EP were recorded at co-producer Eric McConnell's studio with backing from some of the musicians who worked on Snider's two previous albums, including guitarist [[Will Kimbrough]], bassist Dave Jacques, keyboardist [[Dave Zollo]], and drummers Paul Griffith and Craig Wright. The remainder of the EP was recorded with co-producer [[Doug Lancio]] at his studio with Lancio providing musical accompaniment and [[Patty Griffin]] contributing backing vocals to two of the tracks — \"Cape Henry\" and the cover of John Fogerty's \"[[Fortunate Son]].\" Released on October 14, 2008,<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.allmusic.com/album/peace-queer-mw0000795517/credits |title= Todd Snider – ''Peace Queer'': Credits |website= AllMusic |access-date= August 13, 2021}}</ref> the record went to number one on the Americana Airplay Chart and number eight on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Heatseekers Albums chart.<ref>{{cite magazine |url= https://www.billboard.com/artist/todd-snider/chart-history/tln/ |title= Chart History: Todd Snider: Heatseekers Albums |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= October 31, 2008 |magazine= Billboard |access-date= August 13, 2021}}</ref>\n\n====Yep Roc album====\nAimless did not release Snider's next album, ''[[The Excitement Plan]]'', because he had already committed it to Yep Roc Records, but it would be the last record he would make for another record label.
