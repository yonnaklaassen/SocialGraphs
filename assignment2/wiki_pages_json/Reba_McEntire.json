With her mother's help, she and her siblings formed the Singing McEntires, which played at local events and recorded for a small label. McEntire later enrolled at [[Southeastern Oklahoma State University]] and studied to become a public school teacher. She also continued to occasionally perform and was heard singing at a rodeo event by country performer [[Red Steagall]]. Drawn to her singing voice, Steagall helped McEntire secure a country music recording contract with [[PolyGram]]/[[Mercury Records]] in 1975. In that year, she relocated with her mother to [[Nashville, Tennessee]].\n\nOver the next several years, PolyGram/Mercury released a series of McEntire's albums and singles, which amounted to little success. In the early 1980s McEntire's music gained more momentum through several top ten country songs, including \"[[(You Lift Me) Up to Heaven]]\", \"[[I'm Not That Lonely Yet]]\", and her first number one \"[[Can't Even Get the Blues]]\". Yet McEntire became increasingly unhappy with her career trajectory and signed with [[MCA Records]] in 1984. Her second MCA album titled ''[[My Kind of Country (Reba McEntire album)|My Kind of Country]]'' (1984) became her breakout release, spawning two number one ''Billboard'' country singles and pointed toward a more traditional musical style. Through the 1980s McEntire released seven more studio albums and had ten more number one country hits. Her number one singles included \"[[One Promise Too Late]]\", \"[[The Last One to Know (song)|The Last One to Know]]\", and the [[Grammy Award]]-winning \"[[Whoever's in New England (song)|Whoever's in New England]]\".\n\nIn 1991, McEntire lost eight of her band members in a plane crash in [[San Diego]], California. The experience led to McEntire's critically acclaimed album ''[[For My Broken Heart]]'', which is her highest-selling album to date. She followed it with several commercially successful albums during the 1990s, including ''[[Read My Mind (album)|Read My Mind]]'' (1994), ''[[What If It's You]]'' (1996), and ''[[If You See Him]]'' (1998). These albums featured the number one country singles \"[[The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter (song)|The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter]]\", \"[[How Was I to Know (Reba McEntire song)|How Was I to Know]]\", and a duet with [[Brooks and Dunn]] called \"[[If You See Him/If You See Her]]\". McEntire's acting career began in January 1990 when she made her film debut in ''[[Tremors (1990 film)|Tremors]]''. In 2001, she played the role of [[Annie Oakley]] in the Broadway musical ''[[Annie Get Your Gun (musical)|Annie Get Your Gun]]''. In the same year [[The WB]] launched the TV series ''[[Reba (TV series)|Reba]]'', in which she starred. More recently, she has guest-starred on ''[[Young Sheldon]]'' as June Ballard. Since 2023, McEntire has been featured as a coach on ''[[The Voice (American TV series)|The Voice]]''.\n\n==Early life==\nMcEntire was born in [[McAlester, Oklahoma]], in 1955<ref name=\"allmusicbio\">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p1724|pure_url=yes}} |title=Reba McEntire&nbsp;– Biography |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=October 22, 2021}}</ref> but was raised on a ranch in [[Chockie, Oklahoma]].<ref name=\"Hall of Fame\">{{cite web |title=Reba McEntire: Artist Bio |url=https://countrymusichalloffame.org/artist/reba-mcentire/ |website=[[Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum]] |access-date=October 22, 2021}}</ref><ref name=\"Fort Worth\">{{cite news |last=Koop |first=Chacour |title=A rival for Rocky?

McEntire recalled in her autobiography continually making excuses for her mother to stop the car instead of traveling to Nashville.
