His songs, such as \"[[Twenty Flight Rock]]\", \"[[Summertime Blues]]\", \"[[C'mon Everybody]]\" and \"[[Somethin' Else (song)|Somethin' Else]]\", captured teenage frustration and desire in the mid-1950s and early 1960s.<ref name=\"RRHOF\">{{cite web|last=Hill|first=Michael|title=Eddie Cochran: Hall of Fame Essay|work=Inductees of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame|publisher=[[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]|location=Cleveland, Ohio|year=1987|url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/eddie-cochran/|access-date=April 14, 2020}}</ref> Cochran experimented with [[multitrack recording]], distortion techniques, and [[overdubbing]], even on his earliest singles.<ref name=Cochran2003>{{cite book|last1=Cochran|first1=Bobby|author-link=Bobby Cochran|last2=Van Hecke|first2=Susan|title=Three Steps to Heaven: The Eddie Cochran Story|publisher=Hal Leonard|location=Milwaukee, Wisconsin|year=2003|isbn=978-0634032523}}</ref> Cochran played the guitar, piano, bass, and drums.<ref name=RRHOF/> His image as a sharply dressed and attractive young man with a rebellious attitude epitomized the stance of the 1950s rocker, and in death, Cochran achieved iconic status.<ref>{{cite web|last=Deming|first=Mark|title=Eddie Cochran Biography|website=[[AllMusic]]|year=2020|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/eddie-cochran-mn0000793988/biography|access-date=April 14, 2020}}</ref>\n\nCochran was involved with music from an early age, playing in the school band and teaching himself to play blues guitar.<ref name=Cochran2003/> In 1955, Cochran formed a duo with the guitarist [[Hank Cochran]] (no relation) and became known as the Cochran Brothers. When they split the following year, Eddie began a song-writing career with [[Jerry Capehart]]. His first success came when he performed the song \"[[Twenty Flight Rock]]\" in the film ''[[The Girl Can't Help It]]'', starring [[Jayne Mansfield]]. Soon afterward, he signed a recording contract with [[Liberty Records]] and his first record for the label, \"[[Sittin' in the Balcony]]\", rose to number 18 on the [[Billboard charts]].\n\nCochran died at the age of 21 in St Martin's Hospital, [[Bath, Somerset]], after a car accident in [[Chippenham]], [[Wiltshire]], at the end of his British tour with [[Gene Vincent]] in April 1960.  On April 16, after they had just performed at the [[Bristol Hippodrome]], on their way to their next venue, Vincent, Cochran and the songwriter [[Sharon Sheeley]] were involved in a high-speed traffic accident in a private-hire taxi. The other two passengers survived with major injuries, but Cochran, who had been thrown from the vehicle, suffered serious brain injuries and died the next day.\n\nThough Cochran's best-known songs were released during his lifetime, more of his songs were released posthumously. In 1987, Cochran was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. His songs have been recorded by a wide variety of recording artists. [[Paul McCartney]] himself chose Cochran's \"[[Twenty Flight Rock]]\" as his audition piece, assured to impress [[John Lennon]] by his performance of it, which he did and was hired as a member of Lennon's [[skiffle]] group [[The Quarrymen]], which later was renamed [[The Beatles]].\n\n==Early life==\nCochran was born on October 3, 1938, in [[Albert Lea, Minnesota]], to Alice and Frank R. Cochran. He was of [[Scottish people|Scottish]] descent.<ref name=\"Cochran2003\" /> Cochran's parents were from Oklahoma. Cochran took music lessons in school but quit the band to play drums. Additionally, rather than taking piano lessons, he began learning guitar, playing country and other music he heard on the radio.\n\nIn 1952, Cochran's family moved to [[Bell Gardens, California]]. As his guitar playing improved, Cochran formed a band with two friends from his junior high school. In January 1955, Cochran dropped out of [[Bell Gardens High School]] in his first year to become a professional musician.<ref name=\":4\">{{cite web |year=2020 |title=Eddie Cochran Biography |url=https://www.gretschguitars.com/features/eddie-cochran |access-date=April 14, 2020 |work=Featured Pages |publisher=Gretsch Guitars |location=Savannah, Georgia}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n=== The Cochran Brothers (1955–1956) ===\n[[File:The Cochran Brothers.jpg|thumb|The Cochran Brothers]]\nDuring a show featuring many performers at an [[American Legion]] hall, Cochran met [[Hank Cochran]], a songwriter.

In the spring of 1956, [[Boris Petroff]] asked Cochran if he would appear in the musical comedy film ''[[The Girl Can't Help It]]'' (1956). Cochran agreed and performed the song \"[[Twenty Flight Rock]]\" in the movie. In 1957, Cochran starred in his second film, ''[[Untamed Youth]]'' (1957), and had yet another hit, \"[[Sittin' in the Balcony]]\", one of the few songs he recorded that was written by other songwriters (in this case [[John D. Loudermilk]]). \"Twenty Flight Rock\" was written by AMI staff writer [[Ned Fairchild]] (a pen name—her real name is Nelda Fairchild). Fairchild, who was not a rock and roll performer, merely provided the initial form of the song; the co-writing credit reflects Cochran's major changes and contributions to the final product.\n\n==== ''Singin' to My Baby'' (1957) ====\nIn the summer of 1957, [[Liberty Records]] issued Cochran's only studio album released during his lifetime, ''[[Singin' to My Baby]]''. The album included John D. Loudermilk's \"Sittin' in the Balcony\". For the album, Cochran worked with manager and songwriter [[Jerry Capehart]], and wrote the songs \"Completely Sweet\", \"Undying Love\", \"When I'm Mad\", and Cochran original \"One Kiss\".<ref>{{Cite web |date=1957 |title=Eddie Cochran With The Johnny Mann Orchestra And Chorus – Singin' To My Baby |url=https://www.discogs.com/master/290087-Eddie-Cochran-With-The-Johnny-Mann-Orchestra-And-Chorus-Singin-To-My-Baby |access-date=May 25, 2024 |website=Discogs}}</ref>\n\nIn 1958, Cochran seemed to find his stride in the famous teenage anthem \"[[Summertime Blues]]\" (co-written with Jerry Capehart). With this song, Cochran was established as one of the most important influences on rock and roll in the 1950s, both lyrically and musically. The song, released by [[Liberty Records|Liberty]] recording no. 55144, charted at number&nbsp;8 in 1958.\n\nOriginally, Cochran toured with [[The Kelly Four]] as his backing band, guitarist [[Mike Deasy]], saxophonist Mike Henderson, bassist [[Dave Shriver]], and drummer [[Gene Riggio]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Kelly Four Discography {{!}} Discogs |url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/2874069-The-Kelly-Four |access-date=May 27, 2024 |website=Discogs}}</ref> They were known as The Hollywood Swingers, a reference to [[Dick D'Agostin]]'s band. The line-up of Cochran's touring band would change overtime, with saxophonist [[Seals and Crofts|Jim Seals]] and bassist [[Connie 'Guybo' Smith]], and the addition of pianist [[Jim Stivers]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Jimmy Seals session with Eddie Cochran |url=http://thompsonian.info/sealsec.html |access-date=2024-05-27 |website=thompsonian.info}}</ref> They were eventually joined by various members from Dick D'Agostin and The Swingers. In 1959, The Swingers line-up became [[Multi-instrumentalist|muti-instrumentalist]] with pianist Dick D'Agostin, pianist Jim Stivers (briefly on bass), guitarist [[Larry D'Agostin]], saxophonist [[Paul Kaufman]], and drummer Gene Riggio. However, D'Agostin left and was called-up to enlist into the U.S. Army. Members from The Kelly Four returned, Deasy and Henderson, with Stivers and Riggio being accompanied by bassist Don Meyer (later replaced by Dave Shriver). This was the last line-up of Cochran's touring band, returning to the name of The Kelly Four.<ref name=\":3\" /> [[File:C'mon, Everybody - Billboard ad 1958.jpg|thumb|''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' advertisement, December 15, 1958]]\n\nCochran starred in his last film ''[[Go, Johnny, Go!]]'' (1959).<ref>{{Cite AV media |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0051665/ |title=Go, Johnny, Go!

Cochran's friends and family later said that he was badly shaken by their deaths, and he developed a morbid premonition that he also would die young. Shortly after their deaths, Cochran recorded a song (written by disc jockey Tommy Dee) in tribute to them, \"[[Three Stars (song)|Three Stars]]\". He was anxious to give up life on the road and spend his time in the studio making music, thereby reducing the chance of suffering a similar fatal accident while touring. Financial responsibilities, however, required that Cochran continue to perform live, and that led to his acceptance of an offer to tour the [[United Kingdom]] in 1960.\n\n=== United Kingdom tour (1960) ===\nOrganized and promoted by [[Larry Parnes]], Cochran and [[Gene Vincent]] toured the United Kingdom from January through to April 1960.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.americanrocknrolluktours.co.uk/tour/eddie-cochran-jan-april-1960/ |title = Eddie Cochran – Jan / April 1960 « American Rock n Roll the UK Tours|website=Americanrocknrolluktours.co.uk}}</ref> On the bill, they were accompanied by British acts [[Billy Fury]], [[Joe Brown (musician)|Joe Brown]], [[Vince Eager]], and [[Tony Sheridan]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Edwardian Teddy Boy - 1960 Tour of Vincent & Cochran |url=https://www.edwardianteddyboy.com/page64.html |access-date=2024-05-24 |website=www.edwardianteddyboy.com}}</ref> At the beginning of the tour, Cochran first performed a memorable show in [[Ipswich]], [[Suffolk]] at the cinema venue [[Regent Theatre, Ipswich|Ipswich Gaumont]].
