Since 2018, the band has consisted of [[Jeff Hanna]] and his son Jaime Hanna, both guitarists and vocalists, along with Jimmie Fadden (drums, harmonica, vocals), Bob Carpenter (keyboards, accordion, vocals), [[Ross Holmes]] (fiddle, mandolin, vocals), and [[Jim Photoglo]] (bass guitar, vocals).\n\nJeff Hanna and Fadden founded the band in 1966 with a lineup initially consisting of Bruce Kunkel, Ralph Barr, Les Thompson, and [[Jackson Browne]], who quit early on and was replaced by longtime member [[John McEuen]] (vocals, guitar, banjo). The band had its first hit single in 1967 with \"Buy for Me the Rain\" on [[Liberty Records]]. Their earliest work featured [[jug band]] and traditional [[folk music|folk]] elements. In 1970, Nitty Gritty Dirt Band had their biggest pop hit with a cover of [[Jerry Jeff Walker]]'s \"[[Mr. Bojangles (song)|Mr. Bojangles]]\". The band's sound took on elements of [[soft rock]] in the latter half of the 1970s and early 1980s, including the hit singles \"[[An American Dream (song)|An American Dream]]\" and \"Make a Little Magic\".\n\nStarting in 1983, Nitty Gritty Dirt Band began a shift toward [[country music]], led off by the singles \"Shot Full of Love\" and \"[[Dance Little Jean]]\". By this point, the band consisted of Jeff Hanna, McEuen, Fadden, Carpenter, and [[Jimmy Ibbotson]] (bass guitar, vocals). This lineup recorded several country albums for [[Warner Records]] throughout the 1980s and charted multiple singles on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]]. Of these, \"[[Long Hard Road (The Sharecropper's Dream)]]\", \"[[Modern Day Romance]]\", and \"[[Fishin' in the Dark]]\" all went to number one, with the latter becoming their [[signature song]]. After leaving Warner in the late 1980s, Nitty Gritty Dirt Band recorded for several other labels, including [[Universal Records (1988)|Universal]], [[MCA Nashville]], [[Rising Tide Records|Rising Tide]], and [[DreamWorks Records]]. The band has collaborated with a number of artists, including [[Doc Watson]], [[Linda Ronstadt]], [[John Denver]], and [[Steve Martin]]. In addition, Hanna co-wrote [[Rascal Flatts]]'s 2005 single \"[[Bless the Broken Road]]\", which was originally recorded by Nitty Gritty Dirt Band.\n\nNitty Gritty Dirt Band has released three collaborative albums: ''[[Will the Circle Be Unbroken (album)|Will the Circle Be Unbroken]]'' (1972), ''[[Will the Circle Be Unbroken: Volume Two]]'' in 1989, and ''[[Will the Circle Be Unbroken, Volume III]]'' in 2002. All three albums featured a large number of guests from folk, rock, country, and [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]]. They have also won three [[Grammy Awards]]. The band's sound draws influence from country, pop, rock, bluegrass, and folk music, and has seen generally positive critical reception.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Jackson Browne 2017.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Jackson Browne was a founding member of Nitty Gritty Dirt Band.|alt=Musician Jackson Browne, playing an electric guitar and singing into a microphone.]]\nNitty Gritty Dirt Band was founded in [[Long Beach, California]], in 1966.

Colin Larkin, in ''The Virgin Encyclopedia of Country Music'', wrote that their early albums contained [[jug band]] and [[Vaudeville]] influences, while by the release of ''Uncle Charlie and His Dog Teddy'', the band \"abandoned the jokey elements...[and] pursued a career as purveyors of superior [[country rock]].\"<ref name=\"virgin\"/> Mark Deming spoke similarly of their early material, noting influences of [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] in the \"Mr. Bojangles\" cover as well as the tracks from the first ''Will the Circle Be Unbroken'' album. He also defined the band's late-1970s output as [[soft rock]], and that their 1990s and 21st-century material was indebted to [[American folk music]].<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> On the same site, Stephen Thomas Erlewine also noticed influences of soft rock on ''The Dirt Band''.<ref name=\"erlewine dirt\"/> Rickey Ferguson thought the band's country influences were more evident on ''Plain Dirt Fashion'' due to the use of instruments such as [[Dobro]], [[fiddle]], and [[mandolin]].<ref name=\"rickey\"/> Holly Gleason noted the [[twang]] evident in Hanna's and Ibbotson's singing voices, and thought the band's [[rhythm section]]s were stronger than usual for a country band.<ref name=\"gleason\"/>\n\nDuring the release of ''Will the Circle Be Unbroken'', the band members were noted for their long-haired appearance, which at the time was considered counter to the appearances of country music acts at the time. [[Bill Monroe]] was said to have refused an offer to appear on the album, and [[Roy Acuff]] was initially apprehensive before joining.<ref name=\"gone\"/> The band said that an impetus behind their shift to country music in the 1980s was the lack of a successful pop song after \"An American Dream\" and \"Make a Little Magic\", followed by a realization that members of the country music community in Nashville were still fans of their music.<ref name=\"gone\"/> They also thought that the first two ''Will the Circle Be Unbroken'' projects helped to \"dim the lines\" between pop and country, especially since the genre of [[country rock]] was still new when the first one was recorded.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/212741105/ | title='The Circle' still unbroken | work=The Times | date=October 4, 1989 | accessdate=July 12, 2024 | author=Troy Moon | pages=6C}}</ref> Walter Tunis of the ''[[Lexington Herald-Leader]]'' thought that the band was an early example of the California-based country rock movement of the 1970s furthered by bands such as [[the Flying Burrito Brothers]] and [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], and that such a comparison was furthered when former Eagles member Bernie Leadon joined. He also thought that the band's success in country in the 1980s was more indebted to marketing and changes in taste from listeners more so than a shift in sound within the band itself. Leadon also stated that he heard influences of the Eagles within the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band's songs.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/689099284/ | title=Nitty Gritty Dirt Band music still has its flavor of '70s | work=Lexington Herald-Leader | date=October 21, 1987 | accessdate=July 12, 2024 | author=Walter Tunis | pages=38}}</ref> Jim Wensits of ''[[The South Bend Tribune]]'' described the band as a \"coming force in country rock\" during the success of \"Mr. Bojangles\", and added that they \"confounded critics by refusing to be categorized.\" He also thought that the band's sound during the 1970s was comparable to the Eagles, and that some songs such as their cover of \"Jambalaya\" featured influences of [[Cajun music]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/518398575/ | title=After 20 years, 'Nitty Gritty Band' continues to hit paydirt | work=The South Bend Tribune | date=September 14, 1986 | accessdate=July 12, 2024 | author=Jim Wensits | pages=C6}}</ref>\n\nIn a 2022 concert review, Jeffrey B. Remz of Country Standard Time opined that Jeff Hanna's \"voice was well intact at 75\" and that he had \"an affable, easy going stage presence.\" He also noted that Jaime Hanna, Carpenter, and Fadden occasionally sang lead vocals as well.
