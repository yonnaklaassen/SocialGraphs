Godfrey also told her to drop the accordion—advice she gladly followed, as she had begun to hate the large and heavy instrument.<ref name=Autobiography/> Around the same time, Francis took a job as a singer on [[Demo (music)|demonstration records]], to bring unreleased songs to the attention of established singers and/or their management who might choose to record them for a professional commercial record.<ref name=Sox>William Ruhlmann: ''Connie Francis 1955–1959'', companion book to 5 CD Boxed Set ''White Sox, Pink Lipstick... and Stupid Cupid'', Bear Family Records BCD 16 616 EI, Hambergen (Germany) 1993</ref>\n\n===1955–1957: recording contract but commercial failure===\nIn 1955, ''Startime Kids'' went off the air.

Even when [[MGM Records]] decided to sign a contract with her, it was because one track she had recorded, \"Freddy\", happened to be the name of the son of a company executive, Harry A. Meyerson, who thought of the song as a nice birthday gift. Hence, \"Freddy\" was released as Francis's first single, which turned out to be a commercial failure, just like her next eight solo singles.<ref name=Autobiography/>\n\nDespite these failures, Francis was hired to record the vocals for [[Tuesday Weld]]'s \"singing\" scenes in the 1956 movie ''[[Rock, Rock, Rock (film)|Rock, Rock, Rock]]'', and for Freda Holloway in the 1957 [[Warner Brothers]] rock and roll movie ''[[Jamboree (1957 film)|Jamboree]]''.<ref name=\"BB12167\"/>\n\nIn the fall of 1957, Francis enjoyed her first modest success with a duet single she had recorded with [[Marvin Rainwater]]: \"The Majesty of Love\", with \"You, My Darlin' You\" as the B-side, peaked at number 93 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref>Warner, Jay (2008).

Though success had finally seemed to come with \"The Majesty of Love\", Francis was informed by MGM Records that her contract would not be renewed after her last solo single.\n\nFrancis considered a career in medicine and was about to accept a four-year scholarship offered at [[New York University]]. At what was to have been her final recording session for MGM on October 2, 1957, with [[Joe Lipman]] and his orchestra,<ref name=Roberts/> she recorded a [[cover version]] of the 1923 song \"[[Who's Sorry Now? (song)|Who's Sorry Now?]]\" written by [[Bert Kalmar]] and [[Harry Ruby]]. Francis has said that she recorded it at the insistence of her father, who was convinced it stood a chance of becoming a hit because it was a song adults already knew and that teenagers would dance to if it had a contemporary [[arrangement]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=O-kuAAAAIBAJ&pg=3189,1141022&dq=perry+como&hl=en|title=The Story Behind Those Golden Records|author=Dachs, David|date=10 May 1959|publisher=Rome News-Tribune|access-date=19 November 2010}}</ref>\n\nFrancis did not like the song and argued about it with her father heatedly, delaying the recording of the two other songs during the session so much that she thought no time was left on the continuously running recording tape.<ref name=\"Freeman\"/> Her father insisted, though, and when the recording \"Who's Sorry Now?\" was finished, only a few seconds remained on the tape.<ref name=Autobiography/>\n\nThe single seemed to go unnoticed like all previous releases, just as Francis had predicted, but on January 1, 1958, it debuted on [[Dick Clark]]'s ''[[American Bandstand]]''. Francis watched the show and wrote in her diary:\n\n''I heard Dick Clark mention something about a new girl singer. So, what else is new? Another girl singer. There are ninety-five million females in the country, and I'll bet ninety-five percent of them sing. \"There's no doubt about it\", predicted Mr. Clark. \"She's is headed straight for the number one spot\". I began feeling sorry for myself and a bit envious, too. Good luck to her, I thought. And then Mr. Clark just happened to play a song called \"Who's sorry now\" - MY \"Who's Sorry Now\"!  Well, the feeling was cosmic - just cosmic! Right there in my living-room, it became Mardi Gras-time and New Year's Eve at the turn of the century!''\n[[File:Connie Francis - Cash Box 1959.png|thumb|left|Francis on the January 31, 1959 cover of ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]]'' magazine]]\nAnd on February 15 of that same year, Francis performed it on the first episode of ''[[The Dick Clark Show|The Saturday Night Beechnut Show]]'', also hosted by Clark. By mid-year, over a million copies had been sold, and Francis was suddenly launched into worldwide stardom. In April 1958, \"Who's Sorry Now?\" reached number 1 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] and number 4 in the US.<ref name=\"MusicVF\"/> For the next four years, Francis was voted the \"Best Female Vocalist\" by ''American Bandstand'' viewers.<ref name=Autobiography/>\n\nAs Connie Francis explains at each of her concerts, she began searching for a new hit immediately after the success of \"Who's Sorry Now?\" since MGM Records had renewed her contract. After the relative failure of the follow-up singles \"I'm Sorry I Made You Cry,\" which stalled at No.&nbsp;36) and [[Heartaches (song)|\"Heartaches\"]], failing to chart at all, Francis met [[Neil Sedaka]] and [[Howard Greenfield]], who sang a number of ballads they had written for her. After a few hours, Francis began writing in her diary while the songwriters played the last of their ballads. This, and her refusal to let Sedaka and Greenfield see the diary to mine it for material, inspired the duo to write Sedaka's own breakthrough hit \"[[The Diary (song)|The Diary]].\") Afterwards, Francis told them that she considered their ballads too intellectual and sophisticated for the young generation and requested a more lively song. Greenfield urged Sedaka to sing a song they had written that morning with [[the Shepherd Sisters]] in mind. Sedaka protested that Francis would be insulted, but Greenfield said that since she hated all the other songs they had performed, they had nothing to lose. Sedaka then played \"[[Stupid Cupid]].\" When he finished, Francis announced that he had just played her new hit song. It went on to reach number 14 on the ''Billboard'' chart and was her second number 1 in the UK.<ref name=\"MusicVF\"/>\n\nThe success of \"Stupid Cupid\" restored momentum to Francis' chart career, and she reached the U.S. top 40 an additional eight times during the remainder of the 1950s.<ref name=\"MusicVF\"/> She managed to churn out more hits by covering several older songs, such as [[My Happiness (popular song)|\"My Happiness\"]] (number 2 on the Hot 100) and \"[[Among My Souvenirs]]\" (number 7), as well as performing her own original songs. In 1959, she gained two gold records for a double-sided hit: on the A-side, \"[[Lipstick on Your Collar (song)|Lipstick on Your Collar]]\" (number 5), and on the B-side, \"[[Frankie (Connie Francis song)|Frankie]]\" (number 9).\n\n===1959–1973: international recording star===\nFollowing another idea from her father, Francis traveled to [[London]] in August 1959<ref name=Roberts/> to record an Italian album at [[EMI]]'s famous [[Abbey Road Studios]].<ref name=Sox/> Titled ''[[Connie Francis Sings Italian Favorites]]'', the album was released in November 1959. It soon entered the album charts where it remained for 81 weeks, peaking at number 4 and becoming Francis's most successful album. [[Mama (David Whitfield song)|\"Mama,\"]] the single taken from the album, reached number 8 in the United States and number 2 in the United Kingdom.<ref name=Souvenirs>''Souvenirs'', Companion Booklet to 4 CD Boxed Set \"Souvenirs\", Polydor (New York) 1995, Cat.-No. 314 533 382-2</ref>\n\nFollowing this success, Francis recorded seven more albums of \"favorites\" between 1960 and 1964, including [[Connie Francis Sings Jewish Favorites|Jewish]], [[Connie Francis Sings German Favorites|German]], and [[Connie Francis Sings Irish Favorites|Irish]], among others. These albums marked Francis's transition from the youth-oriented [[Rock and roll|rock 'n' roll music]] to [[adult contemporary music]], which George Franconero, Sr. had realized would be necessary if his daughter was to have a successful longterm music career.\n\nNevertheless, Francis continued to record singles aimed at the youth-oriented market. Among her top-ten hits on the Hot 100 were \"[[Breakin' in a Brand New Broken Heart]]\" (1961, number 7), [[When the Girl in Your Arms is the Girl in Your Heart|\"When the Boy in Your Arms (Is the Boy in Your Heart)\"]] (1961, number 10), \"[[Connie Francis Sings \"Second Hand Love\"|Second Hand Love]]\" (1962, number 7), and [[Where the Boys Are (Connie Francis song)|\"Where the Boys Are\"]] (1961, number 4).<ref name=\"MusicVF\"/> The last one became her signature tune and became the theme song of Francis's first [[Where the Boys Are|motion picture]]. The movie introduced the concept of [[spring break]], as the once sleepy town of [[Fort Lauderdale]] became the hotspot for college students on their spring vacation in the wake of the movie's success.\n\nThe success of \"Connie Francis Sings Italian Favorites\" in late 1959/early 1960 led Francis to become one of the first American artists to record regularly in other languages. She was followed by other major British and American recording stars including [[Wanda Jackson]], [[Cliff Richard]], [[Petula Clark]], [[Brenda Lee]], [[the Supremes]], [[Peggy March]], [[Pat Boone]], [[Lesley Gore]], [[the Beatles]] and [[Johnny Cash]], among many others. In her autobiography, Francis mentioned that in the early years of her career, the language barrier in some European countries, especially in Germany, made it difficult for her songs to get airplay.\n\nFrancis used these reflections as the basis for her April 1960 recording, \"[[Everybody's Somebody's Fool]]\" which would go on to become the first single by a female artist to top the [[Hot 100]].<ref>[https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/7616906/leading-ladies-women-success-hot-100-chart Leading Ladies: A Look at Women's No. 1 Success in the Hot 100's History]</ref> Veteran lyricist Ralph Maria Siegel penned a set of German lyrics, named \"''[[Die Liebe ist ein seltsames Spiel]]''\", which, after some friction between Francis and her MGM executives, was recorded and released.<ref name=Autobiography/> The song peaked at number 1 in [[West Germany]].<ref>[https://norwegiancharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Connie+Francis&titel=Die+Liebe+ist+ein+seltsames+Spiel&cat=s Connie Francis - Die Liebe ist ein seltsames Spiel], norwegiancharts.com.

Over the years she expanded her recording portfolio to 15 languages. She also sang in Romanian during a live performance at the 1970 edition of the [[Golden Stag Festival|Cerbul de Aur]] in [[Brașov]], Romania. Francis was not fluent in all of these languages and she had to [[phonetical singing|learn her foreign language songs phonetically]]. Francis explained in a 1961 television interview that she was fluent in Spanish and Italian, but always had a translator nearby to make sure her translated lyrics and especially her pronunciation were as correct as possible.\n[[File:Vacation - The Biggest Sin of All - Billboard ad 1962.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' ad for Francis's final top-ten hit, \"Vacation\", July 14, 1962]] \nIn the wake of \"''Die Liebe ist ein seltsames Spiel''\", Francis enjoyed her greatest successes outside the United States. During the 1960s, her songs not only topped the charts in numerous countries around the world, but she was also voted the number 1 singer in over 10 countries. In 1960, she was named the most popular artist in Europe, the first time a non-European received this honor. From mid-1961 to mid-1963, [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]] closed each day's broadcasts with \"It's Time to Say Goodnight\", a song Francis had recorded especially for them and was not officially released until 1996.<ref name=Twistin>Ron Roberts: ''Connie Francis 1960–1962'', companion book to 5 CD Boxed Set \"Kissin', Twistin', Goin' Where the Boys Are\", Bear Family Records BCD 16 826 EI, Hambergen (Germany) 1996</ref>\n\nFrancis's enduring popularity overseas led to television specials in countries around the world such as Britain, Germany, Spain and Italy. Even at the height of the [[Cold War]], Francis's music was well received in [[Iron Curtain]] countries, and some of her recordings were made available on state-owned record labels such as [[Melodiya]] in the former Soviet Union and on [[Jugoton]] in former Yugoslavia,<ref name=Twistin/> although it was common knowledge that rock 'n' roll was highly disparaged in [[Eastern bloc]] countries.\n\nIn the US, Connie Francis had a third number-one hit in 1962: \"[[Don't Break the Heart That Loves You]]\", and her success led MGM to allow her complete freedom to choose whichever songs she wanted to record.<ref name=Sox/>\n\nFrancis's first autobiography, ''For Every Young Heart'', was published in 1963. On July 3 that same year, she played a [[Royal Command Performance]] for [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] at the [[Alhambra Theatre]] in [[Glasgow]], Scotland. During the height of the [[Vietnam War]] in 1967, Connie Francis performed for US troops.<ref name=\"NotSorry\"/><ref>Voger, Mark. \"[https://www.nj.com/entertainment/2013/11/connie_francis.html Where the boys were: Connie Francis recalls Vietnam trip]\", [[NJ.com]].

She had her final top-ten hit, \"Vacation\", in 1962. A number of Francis's singles reached the top 40 in the US Hot 100 in the mid-1960s, with her last top-40 entry in 1964 being her cover version of \"[[Be Anything (but Be Mine)]]\", a 1952 song made famous by singer/bandleader [[Eddy Howard]]. Despite her declining success on the Hot 100, Francis remained a top concert draw, and her singles – with a more mature style – were charting on the top quarter of'' Billboard's'' [[Billboard Adult Contemporary|Adult Contemporary (AC) Charts]] and sometimes even reached ''Billboard's'' [[Billboard Country Singles|Country Charts]].
