Wood was signed to a publishing contract in 1994, writing songs for other country artists, including \"[[Cowboy Love]]\", a Top 5 hit for [[John Michael Montgomery]] in 1996. He signed to a recording contract with [[Liberty Records]] later that year, but did not release anything while on the label. His debut album, ''Between the Earth and the Stars'', was released in 1997 on [[Imprint Records]]. This album produced three chart singles for Wood on the [[Hot Country Songs]] charts that year, including the No.&nbsp;44-peaking \"You Just Get One\". Although he did not chart again after 1997, Wood continued to write songs for other artists into the 2000s, including [[Neal McCoy]] and [[Phil Vassar]], and independently released a second album in 2008.\n\n==Biography==\nWood was born May 10, 1968, in [[Oklahoma City]], Oklahoma. He later attended [[Oklahoma State University]], where he earned a degree in finance and was a member of the [[Sigma Nu]] fraternity.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-67891953.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019224702/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-67891953.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=October 19, 2012 |title=Wood's first disc worth a long wait. |accessdate=December 23, 2007 |last=Phillips |first=Carole L. |date=January 2, 1997|work=[[The Cincinnati Post]]}}</ref> One of Wood's classmates was [[Garth Brooks]], who, like Wood, had aspirations to become a country music artist. Eventually, both singers moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]] to begin their respective careers.\n\nWood was signed to a songwriting contract with EMI Publishing in 1994. One of his first cuts as a songwriter was \"[[Cowboy Love]],\" which was a top five hit on the country charts for [[John Michael Montgomery]] in early 1996.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> [[Liberty Records]] signed Wood to a recording contract later that year, although he did not release anything for the label.<ref name=\"gad\">{{cite web|url=http://www.stp.georgiasouthern.edu/George-Anne/arc3/fal97/1002ent.html#ent2 |title=Jeff Wood: Is he just another pretty face or a true country talent? |accessdate=December 23, 2007 |last=Bruce |first=Robbie |date=October 2, 1997 |work=[[The George-Anne Daily]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060909131920/http://www.stp.georgiasouthern.edu/George-Anne/arc3/fal97/1002ent.html |archivedate=September 9, 2006 }}</ref><ref name=\"radio\">{{cite journal|date=November 29, 1996|title=New artist fact file: Jeff Wood|journal=[[Radio & Records]]|page=48|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-RandR/1990s/1996/R&R-1996-11-29.pdf}}</ref>\n\nBy the end of the year, he had signed to his second recording contract, this time with a newly started independent label, [[Imprint Records]]. His debut album, ''[[Between the Earth and the Stars (Jeff Wood album)|Between the Earth and the Stars]]'', was released on February 11, 1997, under the production of [[Mark Bright (record producer)|Mark Bright]].<ref name=\"radio\"/> The album's lead-off single, \"You Just Get One\", reached number 44 on the ''Billboard'' Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now [[Hot Country Songs]]) charts.<ref name=\"whitburn\">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2008|publisher=Record Research, Inc.|year=2008|pages=474|isbn=978-0-89820-177-2}}</ref> This song was co-written by [[Don Schlitz]] and [[Vince Gill]] (who also played mandolin and guitar on the album), and was previously cut by [[Ty Herndon]] on his 1995 debut album ''[[What Mattered Most]]''.

He continued to write songs for other artists, including [[Tracy Byrd]], [[Neal McCoy]], and [[Phil Vassar]].\n\nWood was formerly the brother-in-law of [[Phil Vassar]] from 2003 to 2007. Vassar was married to Wood's sister, Julie.\n\nIn 2008, Wood returned to recording, issuing an album entitled ''Raw Wood'' independently. Its first single is a song entitled \"Long Way from OK\", a re-recording of a song previously found on his debut album. Wood also released a Christmas album and a religious-themed album.\n\nJeff Wood was nominated for the 7th Annual Independent Music Awards for Band Venue Poster of the year.\n\nIn 2013, Wood issued his third country album entitled \"The Jeff Scott Wood Project, Nothin' But Blue\" independently, JeffScottWood.com.<ref name=\"carousel\">{{cite web|url=http://caughtinthecarousel.com/jeff-wood-album-review/ |title=Jeff Wood-The Jeff Wood Project |accessdate=November 7, 2013 |last=Green |first=Alex |date=July 1, 2013 |work=[[CaughtintheCarousel.com]]}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:20em;\"| Title\n! style=\"width:20em;\"| Album details\n|- \n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[Between the Earth and the Stars (Jeff Wood album)|Between the Earth and the Stars]]''\n| \n* Release date: February 11, 1997\n* Label: [[Imprint Records]]\n* Format: CD, [[audio cassette|cassette]]\n|- \n! scope=\"row\"| ''Raw Wood''\n| \n* Release date: 2008\n* Label: Self-released\n* Format: CD\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''The Jeff Scott Wood Project''\n|\n* Release date: May 10, 2013\n* Label: JeffScottWood.com\n* Format: CD\n|}\n\n===Singles===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Year\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:16em;\"| Single\n! colspan=\"2\"| Peak chart<br />positions\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Album\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n! width=\"45\"| [[Hot Country Songs|US Country]]\n! width=\"45\"| [[RPM (magazine)|CAN Country]]\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\"| 1997\n! scope=\"row\"| \"You Just Get One\"\n| 44\n| 87\n| align=\"left\" rowspan=\"3\"| ''Between the Earth and the Stars''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Use Mine\"\n| 55\n| —\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"You Call That a Mountain\"\n| 63\n| 97\n|-\n| 2008\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Long Way from OK\"\n| —\n| —\n| align=\"left\"| ''Raw Wood''\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" style=\"font-size:8pt\"| \"—\" denotes releases that did not chart\n|-\n|}\n\n===Music videos===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n!
