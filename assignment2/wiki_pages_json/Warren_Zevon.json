His most famous compositions include \"[[Werewolves of London]]\", \"[[Lawyers, Guns and Money]]\", and \"[[Roland the Headless Thompson Gunner]]\". All three songs are featured on his third album, ''[[Excitable Boy]]'' (1978), the title track of which is also well-known. He also wrote major hits that were recorded by other artists, including \"[[Poor Poor Pitiful Me]]\", \"Accidentally Like a Martyr\", \"[[Mohammed's Radio]]\", \"[[Carmelita (song)|Carmelita]]\", and \"[[Hasten Down the Wind (song)|Hasten Down the Wind]]\".\n\nZevon had early music industry successes as a session musician, jingle composer, songwriter, touring musician, musical coordinator, and bandleader. However, Zevon struggled to break through in his solo career until his music was performed by [[Linda Ronstadt]], beginning with her 1976 album ''[[Hasten Down the Wind]]''. It launched a cult following that lasted 25 years, with Zevon making occasional returns to album and single charts until his death from [[mesothelioma]] in 2003. He briefly found a new audience by teaming up with members of [[R.E.M.]] in the [[blues rock]] outfit [[Hindu Love Gods (band)|Hindu Love Gods]] for a 1990 album release, although no tour followed. In 2023, Zevon was nominated for inclusion in the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=2023 Nominees {{!}} Rock & Roll Hall of Fame |url=https://www.rockhall.com/2023-nominees |access-date=February 1, 2023 |website=www.rockhall.com}}</ref>\n\nKnown for his dry wit and acerbic lyrics, he was a guest numerous times on ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' and the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]''.\n\n==Early life==\nZevon was born in [[Chicago]], the son of Beverly Cope (née Simmons) and William Zevon.

[[Bones Howe]] produced their first single, the minor hit \"Follow Me\", which was written by Zevon and Santangelo and reached number 65 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot 100|pop charts]] in April 1966. A follow-up single, a cover of [[Bob Dylan]]'s \"[[If You Gotta Go, Go Now]]\" flopped, and Zevon left the duo. A third single without Zevon and another session that included him but was not previously released were included on the 2003 compilation ''[[The First Sessions]]''.\n\nZevon spent time as a session musician and jingle composer. He wrote several songs for his [[White Whale Records|White Whale]] labelmates [[The Turtles]] (\"Like the Seasons\" and \"Outside Chance\"), though his participation in their recording—if any—is unknown.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/happy-together-mw0000113202/credits |author=Eder, Bruce |publisher= AllMusic.com |access-date=November 22, 2013|title=Review of The Turtles' Happy Together}}</ref> Another early Zevon composition (\"She Quit Me\") was included in the soundtrack for the film ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]'' (1969); to suit its place in the film, the song was re-recorded by Leslie Miller as \"He Quit Me\".\n\nZevon's first attempt at a solo album, ''[[Wanted Dead or Alive (Warren Zevon album)|Wanted Dead or Alive]]'' (1970), was spearheaded by 1960s cult figure [[Kim Fowley]] but received almost no attention and did not sell well. Though Zevon continued to play occasional live dates as a solo artist, the next several years of his career were dominated by session work with other musicians.\n\nDuring the early 1970s, Zevon toured regularly with [[The Everly Brothers]] as keyboard player, band leader, and musical coordinator.<ref name=\"Rolling Stone Bio\"/> Later the same decade, he toured with Don Everly and Phil Everly separately as they tried to launch solo careers after their breakup. He worked particularly closely with Phil, arranging and playing keyboards on his first and third solo albums (''Star Spangled Springer'' (1973) and ''Mystic Line'' (1975)) and co-writing tracks on his second and third albums (''Phil's Diner'' (1974) and the aforementioned ''Mystic Line''). Zevon's song \"[[Carmelita (song)|Carmelita]]\" was also recorded by Canadian singer [[Murray McLauchlan]] on his [[Murray McLauchlan (album)|self-titled album]] of 1972.\n\nThese small successes were not particularly rewarding financially, and Zevon's dissatisfaction with his career (and a lack of funds) led him to briefly move to [[Spain]] in the summer of 1975. He lived and played in the Dubliner Bar, a small tavern in [[Sitges]], near [[Barcelona]], owned by David Lindell, who was a mercenary. Together they composed \"[[Roland the Headless Thompson Gunner]]\".\n\n==Return to L.A. and major-label debut==\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2018}}\n[[File:Warren Zevon 1976.jpg|thumb|right|Zevon in [[Heidelberg, Germany|Heidelberg]] as the opener for [[Jackson Browne]] in 1976.

Ronstadt elected to record many of his songs, including \"Hasten Down the Wind\", \"[[Carmelita (song)|Carmelita]]\", \"[[Poor Poor Pitiful Me]]\", and \"[[Mohammed's Radio]]\". Zevon's first tour, in 1977, included guest appearances in the middle of Jackson Browne concerts, one of which is documented on a widely circulated bootleg recording of a Dutch radio program under the title ''The Offender Meets the Pretender''.\n\nProduced by Browne, ''[[Warren Zevon (album)|Warren Zevon]]'' (1976) was his first album to chart in the United States, peaking at No. 189.<ref name=TG>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/aug/01/warren-zevon-werewolves-of-london-demons|work=[[The Guardian]]|title=Warren Zevon: the man behind the demons|date=August 1, 2013|author=Freeman, Hadley}}</ref> The first edition of the ''[[Rolling Stone Record Guide]]'' (published in 1979) called it \"a masterpiece\".

The title tune is about a juvenile [[antisocial personality disorder|sociopath]]'s murderous prom night and referred to \"Little Susie\", the heroine of the song \"[[Wake Up Little Susie]]\" made famous by his former employers [[The Everly Brothers]]. Other songs such as \"[[Roland the Headless Thompson Gunner]]\" and \"[[Lawyers, Guns and Money]]\" used deadpan humor to wed geopolitical subtexts to hard-boiled narratives. Tracks from this album received heavy FM airplay, and the single release \"[[Werewolves of London]]\", which featured [[Mick Fleetwood]] and [[John McVie]], was a relatively lighthearted work featuring Zevon's signature macabre outlook that reached No. 21 on the charts.\n\nIn ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide|The Rolling Stone Record Guide]]'' (1979), critic [[Dave Marsh]] called Zevon \"one of the toughest rockers ever to come out of Southern California\".<ref>[[Dave Marsh|Marsh, Dave]]; Swenson, John, eds. (1979). ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide|The Rolling Stone Record Guide]]''. New York: Random House.</ref>{{Rp|427}} ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' record reviews editor [[Paul Nelson (critic)|Paul Nelson]] called the album \"one of the most significant releases of the 1970s\" and placed Zevon alongside [[Neil Young]], [[Jackson Browne]], and [[Bruce Springsteen]] as the four most important new artists to emerge in the decade. On May 11, 1980, Zevon and [[Willie Nile]] appeared on the [[King Biscuit Flower Hour]].\n\n[[File:LindaRonstadtPerforming.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Rondstadt singing into a microphone|Country rock musician [[Linda Ronstadt]] helped popularize Zevon's songs in the 1970s.]]\nZevon followed ''Excitable Boy'' with ''[[Bad Luck Streak in Dancing School]]'', in 1980. This album was dedicated to Ken Millar, better known under his nom-de-plume as the detective novelist [[Ross Macdonald]]. One of Zevon's literary heroes, Millar met the singer for the first time while participating in an [[intervention (counseling)|intervention]] organized by Nelson, which helped Zevon temporarily curtail his addictions. Featuring a modest hit with the single \"A Certain Girl\" (Zevon's cover of an [[R&B]] record by [[Ernie K-Doe]]) which reached No. 57 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] singles chart, the album sold briskly but was uneven, and represented a decline rather than commercial and critical consistency. It contained a collaboration with [[Bruce Springsteen]] on the song \"Jeannie Needs a Shooter\" and the ballad \"Empty-Handed Heart\" featuring a [[descant]] sung by [[Linda Ronstadt]], which is about Zevon's divorce from his wife, Crystal, the mother of his daughter Ariel; she has been erroneously described in some sources as his \"second wife\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /><ref>{{cite news |last=Pollak |first=Sally |date=May 29, 2015 |title=Unplugged in Peacham: Ariel Zevon builds a life in NEK |url=http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/story/news/local/2015/05/29/unplugged-peacham-living-grid/28072963/ |work=Burlington Free Press |location=Burlington, VT}}</ref> (Marilyn \"Tule\" Livingston, the mother of his son, [[Jordan Zevon|Jordan]], and Zevon were in a long-term relationship but never married.)

The album also contains the first of Zevon's writing collaborations with respected writers of fiction: \"The Overdraft\", co-written with [[Thomas McGuane]]. The title track was dedicated to [[Philip Habib]], U.S. special envoy to the Middle East during the early 1980s. In the liner notes for the 1996 anthology ''I'll Sleep When I'm Dead'', Zevon stated that after the song came out, Habib sent him \"a very nice letter of appreciation on [[United States Department of State|State Department]] stationery\".<ref>Zevon, Warren.

Philadelphia Weekly.</ref> After ''The Envoy'' was poorly received by critics, [[Asylum Records]] ended their business relationship with Zevon, which Zevon discovered only when he read about it in the \"Random Notes\" column of ''Rolling Stone''. Following these career setbacks, he relapsed into drug and alcohol abuse. In 1984, he voluntarily checked himself into a rehab clinic in Minnesota. His relationship with Gevinson ended shortly thereafter.<ref name=\"Valania\"/> Zevon retreated from the music business for several years, except for playing live solo shows; during this time he finally overcame severe alcohol and drug addictions.\n\nDuring this time, Zevon collaborated with [[Bill Berry]], [[Peter Buck]] and [[Mike Mills]] (of [[R.E.M.]]), and backup vocalist Bryan Cook to form a minor project called [[Hindu Love Gods (band)|Hindu Love Gods]]. The group released the non-charting single \"Narrator\" for [[IRS Records]] in 1984, then went into abeyance for several years.\n\nBerry, Buck and Mills served as the core of Zevon's next studio band when he re-emerged in 1987 by signing with [[Virgin Records]] and recording the album ''[[Sentimental Hygiene]]''. The release, hailed as his best since ''Excitable Boy'', featured a thicker rock sound and taut, often humorous songs like \"Detox Mansion\", \"Bad Karma\" (which featured [[R.E.M.]] lead singer [[Michael Stipe]] on backup vocals), and \"Reconsider Me\". Included were contributions from [[Neil Young]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Flea (musician)|Flea]], [[Brian Setzer]], and [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]], as well as Berry, Buck, and Mills. Also on hand were Zevon's longtime collaborators [[Jorge Calderón]] and [[Waddy Wachtel]].\n\nDuring the ''Sentimental Hygiene'' sessions, Zevon also participated in an all-night jam session with Berry, Buck and Mills, as they worked their way through rock and blues numbers by artists including [[Bo Diddley]], [[Muddy Waters]], [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]] and [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]. Though the sessions were not initially intended for release, they eventually were as [[Hindu Love Gods (band)|Hindu Love Gods']] [[Hindu Love Gods (album)|sole album]].\n\nThe immediate follow-up to ''Sentimental Hygiene'' was 1989's ''[[Transverse City]]'', a futuristic [[concept album]] inspired by Zevon's interest in the work of [[cyberpunk]] science fiction author [[William Gibson]]. It featured guests including [[Little Feat]] drummer [[Richie Hayward]], [[Jefferson Airplane]] and [[Hot Tuna]] bassist [[Jack Casady]], noted jazz keyboardist [[Chick Corea]] and various guitarists, including Wachtel, [[David Lindley (musician)|David Lindley]], [[Jerry Garcia]], [[Jorma Kaukonen]], [[David Gilmour]] and [[Neil Young]]. Key tracks include the title song, \"Splendid Isolation\", \"Run Straight Down\" (which had a promotional video that featured Zevon singing in a factory while Gilmour played guitar solos), and \"They Moved the Moon\" (one of Zevon's eerier ballads).\n\n==Later years and second comeback==\n''Transverse City'' was a commercial disappointment, and Zevon was dropped by Virgin Records soon after the album's release. He almost immediately contracted, however, with [[Irving Azoff]]'s new label [[Giant Records (Warner Bros. subsidiary label)|Giant Records]]. The first release under Zevon's contract with his new distributor was the album ''[[Hindu Love Gods (album)|Hindu Love Gods]]'', recorded during the ''Sentimental Hygiene'' sessions. The album included a cover of [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]'s \"[[Raspberry Beret]]\", which became a number 23 Modern Rock hit in the United States.\n\nIn 1991, Zevon who once again was a solo artist, released ''[[Mr. Bad Example]]''. The album featured the modest pop hit \"Searching for a Heart\" and the rocker \"Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead\", later used as the title of the [[neo-noir]] [[Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead|film of the same name]], directed by [[Gary Fleder]]; after some skirmishing over the unauthorized use of Zevon's song title, the Zevon track was licensed to play over the film's end credits. Zevon also sang lead vocals on the song \"Casey Jones\" from the Grateful Dead tribute album ''[[Deadicated]]'', with regular collaborator David Lindley.\n\nZevon toured the United States (with the [[Odds (band)|Odds]]), Europe, Australia and New Zealand during this period. Owing to his reduced circumstances, his performances were often true solo efforts with minimal accompaniment on piano and guitar;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/noevalleyvoice167unse|title=Noe Valley Voice|date=October 1, 1992|publisher=Sarah Smith & Jack Tipple|via=Internet Archive}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/THE-MUSIC-MAN-2507072.php|title=The Music Man|date=January 8, 2006|publisher=[[SFGate]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|access-date=March 31, 2018|title=Music Series Bids Farewell to Ministry Stage: Reprise Possible in Two Years|author=World, Heather|url=http://www.noevalleyvoice.com/2010/November/NVMS.htm|website=Noevalleyvoice.com|date=November 2010}}</ref> the live album ''[[Learning to Flinch]]'' (1993) documents such a tour.

Zevon also served as musical coordinator and occasional guitarist for an ad-hoc rock music group called the [[Rock Bottom Remainders]], a collection of writers performing rock-and-roll standards at book fairs and other events. The group included [[Stephen King]], [[Dave Barry]], [[Matt Groening]] and [[Amy Tan]], among other popular writers; it has continued to perform one benefit concert per year since Zevon's death.\n\nAn affiliated project for which Zevon both played and wrote liner notes is the offbeat 1998 album ''[[Stranger Than Fiction (Rock Bottom Remainders album)|Stranger Than Fiction]]'', a two-CD set attributed to the Wrockers, containing rock covers and originals by many of the Remainders authors plus such notables as [[Norman Mailer]] and [[Maya Angelou]]. Zevon oversaw music for the short-lived revival of the [[NBC]] series ''[[Route 66 (television series)|Route 66]]'' (1993), contributing that show's main title theme, \"If You Won't Leave Me I'll Find Somebody Who Will\". His music was also featured in the four [[William Shatner]] ''[[TekWar]]'' movies in 1994. Zevon is listed as \"theme music composer\" in the opening credits. His song \"Real or Not\" was used as the show's end credit theme song. The song appeared on Zevon's 2-CD set, ''I'll Sleep When I'm Dead (An Anthology)''. In the accompanying booklet, Zevon wrote, \"I wrote this song for the William Shatner TV movies based on his novels. He ''is'' Captain Kirk, rest assured. He'd call me at home and demand to hear the song in progress, then he'd say \"We need more guitars! More driving guitars!\" It was cool. The track reflected my secret fondness for sleazy English techno records.\"\n\nOccasionally between 1982 and 2001, Zevon filled in for [[Paul Shaffer]] as bandleader on ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' and later the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]''.\n\nIn 1995, Zevon released the self-produced ''[[Mutineer (album)|Mutineer]]''. The title track was frequently covered by Bob Dylan on his U.S. fall tour in 2002.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bjorner.com/2002%206%207.htm |title=Dylan Set Lists at Olaf's Files for 2002|publisher=Bjorner.com |access-date=June 29, 2010}}</ref> Zevon's cover of cult artist [[Judee Sill]]'s \"Jesus Was a Crossmaker\" predated the wider rediscovery of her work a decade later. The album, however, had the worst sales of Zevon's career, in part because of lack of promotion from his label, Giant. [[Rhino Records]] released a Zevon \"best-of\" compilation in 1996, ''[[I'll Sleep When I'm Dead (An Anthology)|I'll Sleep When I'm Dead]]''. Zevon also appeared on the ''[[Larry Sanders Show]]'' on [[HBO]], in 1993, playing himself as a guest on the show, promoting ''[[Learning to Flinch]]''. Zevon also played himself on two episodes of ''[[Suddenly Susan]]'' in 1999, along with singer and actor [[Rick Springfield]].\n\n[[File:David Letterman 2012.jpg|thumb|upright|Comedian and TV host [[David Letterman]] was credited by Zevon as \"being the best friend my music ever had\".<ref name=\"nyt-last\"/>]]\n\nAfter another five-year layoff, Zevon signed with industry veteran Danny Goldberg's [[Artemis Records]] and again rebounded with the mortality-themed 2000 release ''[[Life'll Kill Ya]]'', containing the hymn-like \"Don't Let Us Get Sick\" and an austere version of [[Steve Winwood]]'s 1980s hit \"Back in the High Life Again\". With record sales brisk and music critics giving Zevon his best notices since ''Excitable Boy'', ''[[Life'll Kill Ya]]'' is seen as his second comeback. He followed with the album ''[[My Ride's Here]]'' (2002), with its morbid prescience of things to come; the album included \"Hit Somebody! (The Hockey Song)\" (co-written by [[Mitch Albom]], the author of ''[[Tuesdays with Morrie]]'', and featuring [[Paul Shaffer]], the ''Late Night'' band, and a spoken vocal from TV host [[David Letterman]]) and the ballad \"Genius\"—written with Pulitzer Prize and T.S. Eliot Prize-winning poet, Paul Muldoon—later used as the title of an anthology of Zevon's recordings in 2002.\n\nAt about this time, he and the actor [[Billy Bob Thornton]] formed a close friendship, catalyzed by their common experiences with [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]] and the fact they lived in the same apartment building.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />  In 2000, Zevon appeared with Thornton in the movie [[South of Heaven, West of Hell]], written and directed by [[Dwight Yoakam]].

After a period of suffering with pain and shortness of breath, Zevon was encouraged by his dentist to see a physician; he was diagnosed with pleural [[mesothelioma]], a cancer (usually caused by exposure to asbestos) that affects the [[Pulmonary pleurae|pleura]], a thin membrane around the lungs and chest lining.

Zevon had been a frequent guest and occasional substitute bandleader on Letterman's television shows since ''[[Late Night with David Letterman|Late Night]]'' was first broadcast in 1982. He noted, \"I might have made a tactical error in not going to a physician for 20 years.\" It was during this broadcast that, when asked by Letterman if he knew something more about life and death now, he first offered his oft-quoted insight that people need to \"enjoy every sandwich.\"<ref name=\"nyt-last\">{{cite news | work= The New York Times | title = Warren Zevon's Last Waltz | first= Jon | last = Pareles | date = January 26, 2003| access-date = March 27, 2013 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/26/magazine/warren-zevon-s-last-waltz.html}}</ref> He also thanked Letterman for his years of support, calling him \"the best friend my music's ever had\".

The book is largely an oral history that consists of interviews with Zevon's friends, relatives and associates, as well as excerpts from his diaries. Crystal Zevon said Warren had given her permission to use the journal excerpts and instructed her to present an unvarnished portrayal of his life that did not sanitize his many struggles.\n\nGeorge Plasketes, a professor at [[Auburn University]], wrote a critical study of Zevon's music in 2016, ''Warren Zevon, Desperado of Los Angeles''. Zevon was also the subject of Michael Flood's essay \"Lord Byron's Luggage: Warren Zevon and the Redefinition of Literature Rock\".
