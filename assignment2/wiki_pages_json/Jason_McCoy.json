At around the age of 5, his family moved to [[Camrose, Alberta]], returning three years later. \"The cowboy culture really stuck with me. I just fell in love with the music. For some reason, as a little kid, I had some sort of connection with these guys who were singing about these depressing things,\" McCoy said, citing [[Merle Haggard]] and [[Johnny Cash]] to lesser known artists like [[Ed Bruce]] and [[Wynn Stewart]]. \"I just didn't have a voice for rock 'n' roll.\" Jason started playing guitar at age 7<ref name=\"jasonbio\">{{cite web|url=http://www.andersonenterprises.ca/newjasonbiopage1.htm |title=Jason McCoy |website=Andersonenterprises.ca |access-date=2020-03-09}}</ref> and wrote his first song when he was 12.<ref name=\"jasonbio\" />\n\nIn his teens, McCoy owned an electric guitar and was partial to [[AC/DC]].

He later signed with [[MCA Nashville Records|MCA Records]] in 1995.\n\nOn May 1, 1999, McCoy married his longtime girlfriend Terrine Barnes.
