During his performances, Tyler usually dresses in colorful, sometimes [[androgynous]] outfits and makeup with his trademark scarves hanging from his microphone stand.\n\nIn the 1970s, Tyler rose to prominence as the lead singer of Aerosmith, which released such hard rock albums as ''[[Toys in the Attic (album)|Toys in the Attic]]'' and ''[[Rocks (Aerosmith album)|Rocks]]'', along with a string of hit singles, including \"[[Dream On (Aerosmith song)|Dream On]]\", \"[[Sweet Emotion]]\" and \"[[Walk This Way]]\". By the late 1970s and early 1980s, Tyler had a heavy drug and alcohol addiction and the band's popularity waned. In 1986, Tyler completed drug rehabilitation and Aerosmith rose to prominence again when Tyler and Joe Perry joined [[Run-DMC]] for a re-make of \"Walk This Way\", which became a Top 5 hit. Aerosmith subsequently launched a comeback with the multi-platinum albums ''[[Permanent Vacation (Aerosmith album)|Permanent Vacation]]'', ''[[Pump (album)|Pump]]'', ''[[Get a Grip]]'' and ''[[Nine Lives (Aerosmith album)|Nine Lives]]'', which produced a combined thirteen Top 40 singles and won the band numerous awards. During this time, the band embarked on their longest concert tours, promoted their singles with conceptual music videos, and made appearances in television, film and video games.\n\nSince the late 1980s, Tyler has embarked on several solo endeavors, including guest appearances with musicians including [[Alice Cooper]], [[Mötley Crüe]], [[Santana (band)|Santana]], [[Pink (singer)|Pink]] and [[Keith Anderson]], film and TV work, authoring a book, and solo music, including the Top 40 single \"[[(It) Feels So Good]]\" in 2011.

In 1969, Tyler attended a local rock show in [[Sunapee, New Hampshire|Sunapee]], New Hampshire, where he first saw future bandmates Joe Perry (guitars) and [[Tom Hamilton (musician)|Tom Hamilton]] (bass), who at the time were playing in a band called the Jam Band. Tyler later stated he was struck by their raw power and attitude.\n\nAround 1970, Tyler, Perry and Hamilton decided to form a band. Tyler, who had played drums in many of his previous bands while in school, insisted that he would be the frontman and lead singer. Joey Kramer, an old acquaintance of Tyler's from New York, was recruited to play the drums. Tyler invited his boyhood friend, Ray Tabano, to play rhythm guitar. Driven by a collective ambition to launch their careers as full-time musicians and hopeful recording artists, the band moved to the [[Boston]] area, and shared a small apartment at 1325 [[Commonwealth Avenue (Boston)|Commonwealth Avenue]] in [[Allston, Massachusetts|Allston]] in the fall of 1970.\n\nShortly after relocating to Boston, Tyler's dissatisfaction with Tabano's lack of passion and dedication prompted the band to replace Tabano with [[Brad Whitford]]. Although Tyler was never billed as the \"leader\" of Aerosmith, he co-managed, with drummer Joey Kramer, the assets of the band and directed its activities during this formative period.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nAfter spending time on the Boston club circuit under the tutelage of their first manager, Frank Connelly, the band began working with New York managers Steve Leber and David Krebs. Leber describes the band as \"the closest thing I've ever seen to the [[Rolling Stones]]\". In early 1972, the managers arranged the gig at the legendary nightclub [[Max's Kansas City]] to showcase the group to record company executives. They subsequently signed a record deal with [[Columbia Records]] in 1972 and released their [[Aerosmith (album)|eponymous debut album]] in 1973. This was followed by their second album, ''[[Get Your Wings]]'' in 1974.\n[[File:Aerosmith 2.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.75|Steven Tyler and Joe Perry performing live in concert]]\nAround this time, Aerosmith continued to tour wherever they could and opened for bands like [[Mott the Hoople]]. The band had a minor hit in \"Dream On\", which peaked at number 59 in 1973, but Aerosmith did not break into the mainstream until the back-to-back releases of their next sets of albums, ''[[Toys in the Attic (album)|Toys in the Attic]]'' (1975) and ''[[Rocks (Aerosmith album)|Rocks]]'' (1976). In 1975, they achieved their first top-40 hit in \"[[Sweet Emotion]]\". Soon after, \"Dream On\" was re-released and hit number six in 1976, followed by another top-10 hit \"[[Walk This Way]]\". Additionally, ''Rocks'' produced the hit singles \"[[Last Child]]\", \"[[Back in the Saddle]]\" and \"[[Home Tonight]]\".\n\nBy 1976, Aerosmith found themselves headlining huge stadiums and major rock music festivals. That year, Tyler emerged as a prominent rock star and sex symbol in his own right, gracing the cover of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine. The band's fifth album, ''[[Draw the Line (Aerosmith album)|Draw the Line]]'', catapulted them to international fame and recognition, launching tours in Europe and Japan. A series of Hot 100 hits continued throughout the remainder of the decade, including \"[[Draw the Line (song)|Draw the Line]]\", \"[[Kings and Queens (Aerosmith song)|Kings and Queens]]\" and \"[[Chip Away the Stone]]\". Aerosmith's first five albums have \nall since gone multiplatinum and all five are considered to be among the greatest hard rock albums of all time.\n\nAerosmith toured heavily throughout the mid- to late 1970s, and their live shows during this time period were captured through 1978's live album ''[[Live! Bootleg]]'' and the 1989 VHS release ''[[Live Texxas Jam '78]]''. Also in 1978, Tyler made his acting debut as the leader of the Future Villain Band in the film ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (film)|Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'', alongside his Aerosmith bandmates. The film also spawned Aerosmith's cover of the Beatles hit \"[[Come Together]]\", which was Aerosmith's last top-40 single for nine years.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n=== Decline of Aerosmith (1979–1983) ===\nAs the decade wore on, the fast-paced life of touring, recording, living together and using drugs began to take its toll on the band. Tyler and Perry often were called the [[Toxic Twins]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://loudwire.com/poll-best-aerosmith-song-vote/|title=Poll: What's the Best Aerosmith Song? - Vote Now|website=Loudwire|date=August 16, 2021 }}</ref> for their legendary intake of [[stimulant]]s and heroin. Their relationship is well documented in many of Aerosmith's video releases, as well as in the Aerosmith ''[[Behind the Music]]''. On July 28, 1979, after a huge quarrel at a [[World Series of Rock]] concert in [[Cleveland]], Perry left Aerosmith to begin his own band, [[the Joe Perry Project]]. ''[[Night in the Ruts]]'' was released that fall, and Aerosmith forged on with new guitarist [[Jimmy Crespo]].{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nIn the fall of 1980, Tyler was injured in a motorcycle crash that left him hospitalized for two months, and unable to tour or record for much of 1981. When the band reconvened in the studio, Tyler formed a writing partnership with Crespo, co-writing and producing the album ''[[Rock in a Hard Place]]'' (1982). Brad Whitford had left in 1981, shortly after recording the guitar parts for the album's lead single, \"[[Lightning Strikes (Aerosmith song)|Lightning Strikes]]\". Whitford was replaced by [[Rick Dufay]], and the band continued to tour into 1983.\n\nAs the decade wore on, Tyler's drug abuse increased. His heroin addiction was at its worst between 1979 and 1982, when he would roam the streets of New York City looking for dealers.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} \"I made like $4 or $5 million by 1979,\" he recalled, \"and by '83… I lost it all. I remember in the early days looking at another fucked-up rock 'n' roll star and thinking, 'I will never end up like that, man.' They had all these riches and blew it all. That would never happen to me… I forgot about reality and just loved shooting dope and coke. Stupid.\"<ref>{{cite journal|first= Ben |last= Raworth |title= Quote, Unquote: Steven Tyler |journal= [[FHM]] |date=April 1997|page=62}}</ref>\n\n=== Reuniting and getting clean (1984–1986) ===\nOn February 14, 1984, Perry and Whitford, who left the band in 1979 and 1981, respectively, attended an Aerosmith show. According to the band's ''Behind the Music'' special on [[VH1]], Tyler alleged that he made the first phone call to Perry, encouraging them to meet up again. Backstage, they all met and Perry and Whitford agreed to join the band once again. With the new reunion, the band also fired their managers Leber and Krebs, hired new manager [[Tim Collins (manager)|Tim Collins]] (who was managing Joe Perry), and signed a new record contract with [[Geffen Records]]. Aerosmith embarked on a reunion tour, the [[Back in the Saddle Tour]], and recorded once again, releasing ''[[Done with Mirrors]]'' in 1985. However, the band was still using drugs, especially Tyler, who collapsed while performing in [[Springfield, Illinois]], on the 1984 tour. In 1986, the band held a meeting in which the band members staged an intervention on Tyler, and persuaded him to enter a [[drug rehabilitation]] program. After he completed rehabilitation, his bandmates did likewise; all had completed treatment by the mid-1980s.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n=== Comeback and superstardom (1986–1999) ===\n\n{{BLP unreferenced section|date=March 2021}}\nAerosmith rose to prominence again when Tyler and Perry appeared on [[Run–D.M.C.]]'s cover of Aerosmith's \"Walk This Way\" in 1986, a track that combined elements of hip-hop and rock, that broke down the barriers between the two genres, broke rap into the mainstream, and introduced Aerosmith to a new generation. The track hit number four on the charts and launched a famous music video that had heavy rotation. This paved the way for Aerosmith to mount a significant comeback. Tyler and Perry renewed their songwriting partnership, but were also working with outside songwriting collaborators brought in by the record company, such as [[Desmond Child]] and [[Jim Vallance]]. To give Aerosmith a slick sound accessible to mainstream audiences, they received help from producer [[Bruce Fairbairn]]. Aerosmith released ''[[Permanent Vacation (Aerosmith album)|Permanent Vacation]]'' in 1987, which became a huge multiplatinum success and launched three top-20 hits (\"[[Dude (Looks Like a Lady)]]\", \"[[Angel (Aerosmith song)|Angel]]\" and \"[[Rag Doll (Aerosmith song)|Rag Doll]]\"). The band launched a tour with the emerging [[Guns N' Roses]], opening many shows. ''Permanent Vacation'' was followed by 1989's ''[[Pump (album)|Pump]]'', which was even more successful, selling 7 million copies and producing three top-10 hits (\"[[Love in an Elevator]]\", \"[[Janie's Got a Gun]]\" and \"[[What It Takes (Aerosmith song)|What it Takes]]\") and one top-40 hit (\"[[The Other Side (Aerosmith song)|The Other Side]]\"). ''Pump'' in particular had Tyler expand his musical horizons, co-writing the innovative hit \"Janie's Got a Gun\", which won the first Grammy award for the band. The band toured with many emerging acts and performed in locations such as Australia for the first time. In the late 1980s, Tyler also guested on albums by comedian [[Sam Kinison]], [[Alice Cooper]] (a fellow '70s rocker also launching a successful comeback) and popular contemporaries [[Mötley Crüe]]. Around that time, Tyler and Perry appeared at a [[Bon Jovi]] concert in [[Milton Keynes]] and performed \"Walk This Way\".\n\nWith the twin successes of ''Permanent Vacation'' and ''Pump'', the band became an MTV sensation and Tyler became a household name. The band was featured on a \"[[Wayne's World]]\" sketch on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in 1990, which was listed by E! in 2004 as ''SNL'''s most unforgettable moment.<ref>{{cite web |author = TV.com |url = http://www.tv.com/e!s-101/most-unforgettable-snl-moments-20--1/episode/315334/summary.html |title = E!'s 101: Most Unforgettable SNL Moments |publisher = TV.com |date = January 15, 2004 |access-date = December 31, 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110629100629/http://www.tv.com/e%21s-101/most-unforgettable-snl-moments-20--1/episode/315334/summary.html |archive-date = June 29, 2011 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> That same year, Aerosmith recorded one of the first episodes of ''[[MTV Unplugged]]''. In 1991, Aerosmith was one of the first bands to be featured on ''[[The Simpsons]]''. That year, the band also signed a $30&nbsp;million record deal with their old label Columbia, for which they would begin recording the following year. The box set ''[[Pandora's Box (album)|Pandora's Box]]'' was released by Columbia in late 1991, and the band filmed a music video for \"Sweet Emotion\" to promote the release. Earlier in the year, the band also performed \"Dream On\" with an orchestra at MTV's 10th Anniversary celebration; their filmed performance was used as the official video for the song. After a brief break, the band returned to the studio in 1992 to record their next album. The band's A&R man [[John Kalodner]] criticized some of the early material being considered for this album, targeting Tyler's sexually profane lyrics in particular.<ref>{{cite book |title = [[Walk This Way: The Autobiography of Aerosmith]] |last = Davis |first = Stephen |author2 = Aerosmith |year = 1997 |publisher = Avon |location = New York |isbn = 0-380-79531-0 |page = 486 }}</ref>\n\nHowever, the band eventually began recording again and released ''[[Get a Grip]]'' in 1993, which became their most successful album worldwide, selling over 15 million copies and producing a series of hit singles (\"[[Cryin']]\", \"[[Livin' on the Edge]]\", \"[[Eat the Rich (Aerosmith song)|Eat the Rich]]\", \"[[Amazing (Aerosmith song)|Amazing]]\" and \"[[Crazy (Aerosmith song)|Crazy]]\"). While the album had mixed reviews and received some criticism for over-using outside collaborators, Aerosmith won more awards during this time than any other, winning two Grammy Awards, four MTV Video Music Awards, two American Music Awards, a People's Choice award and a ''Billboard'' Award. The band became well known for their videos at this time, which featured film-like storylines and up-and-coming actors and actresses such as [[Edward Furlong]], [[Stephen Dorff]], [[Jason London]], [[Josh Holloway]] and most notably [[Alicia Silverstone]]. Tyler's daughter [[Liv Tyler|Liv]] made her acting debut in the band's video for \"[[Crazy (Aerosmith song)|Crazy]]\" in 1994. The band also launched their biggest and most extensive tour yet, performing over 240 shows in nearly 30 countries, including touring Latin America for the first time and performing in many European countries for the first time.\n[[File:Steven_Tyler_1996.jpg|thumb|Tyler in 1996]]\nAfter the 18-month [[Get a Grip Tour]] ended in December 1994, the band took a break in 1995 to spend time with their families. They needed to rest due to the grueling lifestyle of the previous 10 years under the helm of manager [[Tim Collins (manager)|Tim Collins]], who helped orchestrate much of the band's comeback and sustained success. Tyler and Perry also began writing for a new album, and the band performed a couple of one-off shows in [[Boston]] to try out the new material. They also vacationed together with their families in Florida. Aerosmith, however, almost broke up after Tim Collins spread rumors that band members were deriding each other and that Tyler was being unfaithful to his wife and using drugs again during recording sessions in Miami. The band subsequently fired Collins in 1996 in the middle of recording for their next album. In 1997, they released ''[[Nine Lives (Aerosmith album)|Nine Lives]]'', which went double platinum, launched three hits (\"[[Falling in Love (Is Hard on the Knees)]]\", \"[[Hole in My Soul]]\" and \"[[Pink (Aerosmith song)|Pink]]\"), and won the band their fourth Grammy for \"Pink\". They toured for over two years in support of the album. In 1997, Tyler and Perry were featured in a commercial for the [[Gap (clothing retailer)|GAP]]. That fall, the band's [[Walk This Way: The Autobiography of Aerosmith|tell-all autobiography]] was released.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nIn 1998, while [[Nine Lives Tour|on tour in support of ''Nine Lives'']], Tyler suffered a [[ligament]] injury when a microphone stand fell hard onto his knee. Tyler and the band finished the show, but they had to cancel several dates, and Tyler had to wear a leg cast while filming the video for \"[[I Don't Want to Miss a Thing]]\". The song was the band's first number-one hit and the only song to date by a rock band to debut at number one on the Hot 100. It has since become a slow-dance staple, and at the time introduced Aerosmith and Steven Tyler to [[Generation Y|yet another new generation]]. The song was written for the film ''[[Armageddon (1998 film)|Armageddon]]'', which featured Tyler's daughter Liv. In 1999, Tyler and Perry joined [[Kid Rock]] and Run–D.M.C. to perform \"Walk This Way\" at the MTV Video Music Awards. Earlier that year, the band had the [[Rock 'n' Roller Coaster Starring Aerosmith]] open at [[Walt Disney World]].{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n=== Continued success and touring (2000–2008) ===\n\n{{BLP sources section|date=March 2021}}\n\nIn 2001, Aerosmith played at the [[Super Bowl XXXV]] halftime show and was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. The band released the album ''[[Just Push Play]]'', which featured the top-10 hit \"[[Jaded (Aerosmith song)|Jaded]]\". At the [[2001 Indianapolis 500]], Tyler sang the [[Star Spangled Banner|National Anthem]] in traditional Aerosmith style – complete with a raspy voice, bluesy swagger and a hard rocker yell. When Tyler sang the National Anthem, he changed the words which caused a public outcry. Instead of singing \"Land of the free and the home of the brave\", he changed the words to \"Land of the free and the home of the Indianapolis 500.\" This received negative reactions from veterans and fans, leading Tyler to issue a public apology.\n\n[[File:Aerosmith B.jpg|thumb|Tyler performed alongside bandmates Joe Perry and Brad Whitford at an Aerosmith performance on the [[National Mall]] in 2003]]\nIn 2002, Aerosmith's two-hour-long ''Behind the Music'' was released, chronicling the band's tumultuous history and current activities and touring. They were also honored as MTV Icons. In the summer, they released the compilation ''[[O, Yeah! The Ultimate Aerosmith Hits]]'', which went double platinum and included the new track \"[[Girls of Summer]]\".\n\nIn 2003, Tyler received an honorary degree from [[Berklee College of Music]], and in 2005, received an honorary doctorate from the [[University of Massachusetts Boston]]. In 2003, he inducted [[AC/DC]] into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Later in the year, he went on tour with Aerosmith for the [[Rocksimus Maximus Tour]] with [[Kiss (band)|KISS]]. In 2004, Aerosmith released the blues cover album ''[[Honkin' on Bobo]]'' and launched [[Honkin' on Bobo Tour|a brief tour]] with [[Cheap Trick]], focused on smaller markets. Tyler sang the National Anthem to kick off the [[2004 World Series]] at [[Fenway Park]]. The 2004 film ''[[The Polar Express (film)|The Polar Express]]'' featured Tyler singing \"Rockin' on Top of the World\" alongside a group of animated [[elf|elves]] resembling Aerosmith.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nIn 2005, Tyler sang lead vocals on [[Carlos Santana|Santana]]'s hit single \"[[Just Feel Better]]\" and made a cameo appearance in the film ''[[Be Cool]]''. In 2006, after recovering from throat surgery and the grueling [[Rockin' the Joint Tour]], Tyler performed with Joe Perry and the [[Boston Pops Orchestra]] for the orchestra's annual [[Fourth of July]] concert, his first major public appearance since the surgery. That year, Tyler recorded a duet with [[country music]] artist [[Keith Anderson]], titled \"Three Chord Country and American Rock & Roll\".{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nLater that year, the Aerosmith compilation ''[[Devil's Got a New Disguise: The Very Best of Aerosmith|Devil's Got a New Disguise]]'' was released, which included two new tracks. Tyler hit the road with Aerosmith again for the [[Route of All Evil Tour]] with Mötley Crüe and also made several more public appearances. He made a [[cameo appearance]] on the sitcom ''[[Two and a Half Men]]'', playing himself. On October 14, 2006, Tyler sang \"[[God Bless America]]\" during the seventh-inning stretch at game three of the [[National League Championship Series]] between the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] and the [[New York Mets]] at [[Busch Stadium]] in [[St. Louis]]. On November 24, he volunteered by serving [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] dinner to the needy at a restaurant in [[West Palm Beach, Florida]], before an Aerosmith show there. In 2007, Tyler kept active in Aerosmith with the band's [[Aerosmith World Tour 2007|world tour]] which had them perform in 19 countries. That same year, Steven and Liv Tyler were profiled on ''[[E! True Hollywood Story]].{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}''\n\nOn May 21, 2008, Tyler checked into Las Encinas Hospital rehabilitation clinic in [[Pasadena, California]], to recover from multiple leg surgeries. He made a public statement saying, \"The 'foot repair' pain was intense, greater than I'd anticipated. The months of rehabilitative care and the painful strain of physical therapy were traumatic.
