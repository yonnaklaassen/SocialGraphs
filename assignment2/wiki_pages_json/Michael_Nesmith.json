He was best known as a member of [[the Monkees]] and co-star of their [[The Monkees (TV series)|TV series of the same name]] (1966–1968). His songwriting credits with the Monkees include \"[[Mary, Mary (song)|Mary, Mary]]\", \"[[The Girl I Knew Somewhere]]\", \"[[Tapioca Tundra]]\", \"[[Circle Sky]]\" and \"[[Listen to the Band (song)|Listen to the Band]]\". Additionally, his song \"[[Different Drum]]\" became a hit for [[Linda Ronstadt]] and the [[Stone Poneys]].\n\nAfter leaving the Monkees in 1970, Nesmith continued his successful songwriting and performing career, first with the seminal [[country rock]] group the [[First National Band]], with whom he had a top-40 hit, \"[[Joanne (Michael Nesmith song)|Joanne]]\" (1970). As a solo artist, he scored an international hit with the song \"[[Rio (Michael Nesmith song)|Rio]]\" (1977). He often played a custom-built [[Gretsch]] [[12-string guitar|12-string]] electric guitar with the Monkees and afterwards.\n\nIn 1974, Nesmith founded [[Pacific Arts Corporation|Pacific Arts]], a multimedia production and distribution company, through which he helped pioneer the [[music video]] format, winning the first [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Video of the Year|Video of the Year]] for his hour-long  comedy/variety program, ''[[Elephant Parts]]'' (1981).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.com/nominees/search?artist=&field_nominee_work_value=&year=1981&genre=18|title=Past Winners Search|work=The GRAMMYs|date=April 30, 2017}}</ref> He created one of the first American television programs dedicated to music videos, ''[[PopClips]]'', which aired on [[Nickelodeon]] in 1980, and was soon after approached to help develop the [[MTV]] network, though he declined. Nesmith was also an executive producer of the film ''[[Repo Man (film)|Repo Man]]'' (1984).\n\n==Early life==\nNesmith was born in [[Houston, Texas]], on December 30, 1942.<ref>Carlin, Richard (2005).

His mother married Robert Graham in 1962, and they remained married until 1975. Nesmith and his mother moved to [[Dallas]] to be closer to her family. She took temporary jobs ranging from clerical work to graphic design, eventually attaining the position of executive secretary at Texas Bank and Trust. When Nesmith was 13, his mother invented the typewriter correction fluid later known commercially as [[Liquid Paper]]. Over the next 25 years, she built the Liquid Paper Corporation into an international company, which she sold to [[Gillette (brand)|Gillette]] in 1979 for $47.5 million. She died a few months later at the age of 56.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.women-inventors.com/Bette-Nesmith-Graham.asp |title=Bette Nesmith Graham: Liquid Paper Inventor |website=Women-inventors.com |access-date=April 3, 2012}}</ref>\n\nNesmith attended [[Thomas Jefferson High School (Dallas)|Thomas Jefferson High School]] in Dallas, where he participated in choral and drama activities,<ref name=\"rhino\">[http://monkees.rhino.com/read/mike.lasso ''The Monkees: Mike Nesmith''] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20061018045555/http://monkees.rhino.com/read/mike.lasso |date=October 18, 2006 }} biography from Rhino Records</ref> but enlisted in the [[U.S. Air Force]] in 1960 before graduating.

Learning as he went, he played solo and in a series of working bands, performing [[folk music|folk]], [[country music|country]], and occasionally [[rock and roll]]. He enrolled in [[San Antonio College]], where he met [[John London]] and began a musical collaboration. They won the first San Antonio College talent award, performing a mixture of standard folk songs and a few of Nesmith's original songs. Nesmith began to write more songs and poetry, then he moved to Los Angeles and began singing in folk clubs around the city. He served as the \"Hootmaster\" for the Monday night [[hootenanny]] at [[The Troubadour (Los Angeles)|The Troubadour]], a [[West Hollywood]] nightclub that featured new artists.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Massingill |first1=Randi L. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fTrGAAAAQBAJ |title=Total Control The Monkees Michael Nesmith Story |publisher=FLEXquarters |year=2005 |isbn=9780965821841 |access-date=2021-12-11 }}</ref>\n\n[[Randy Sparks]] from [[The New Christy Minstrels|the New Christy Minstrels]] offered Nesmith a publishing deal for his songs.<ref name=\":0\"/> Nesmith began his recording career in 1963 by releasing a single on the Highness label. He followed this in 1965 with a one-off single released on Edan Records followed by two more recorded singles; one was titled \"The New Recruit\" under the name \"Michael Blessing\", released on [[Colpix Records]], coincidentally also the label of [[Davy Jones (actor)|Davy Jones]], though they did not meet until the Monkees formed.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Greene |first=Andy |date=2012-03-08 |title=Exclusive: Michael Nesmith Remembers Davy Jones |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/exclusive-michael-nesmith-remembers-davy-jones-102258/ |access-date=2024-03-22 |magazine=Rolling Stone |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n[[Frazier Mohawk|Barry Freedman]] told him about upcoming auditions for a new TV series called ''[[The Monkees (TV series)|The Monkees]]''. In October 1965, Nesmith's confident, carefree and laid-back manner impressed the producers and he landed the role as the wool-hat-wearing guitar player \"Mike\" in the show, which required real-life musical talent for writing, instrument playing, singing, and performing in live concerts as part of the Monkees band.<ref name=\"Sandoval, Andrew 2001\">Sandoval, Andrew. ''Music Box Liner Notes: The True Story of \"The Monkees\"'', Rhino Records, 2001.</ref>\n\nNesmith's \"[[Mary, Mary (song)|Mary, Mary]]\" was recorded by the [[Paul Butterfield Blues Band]], the Monkees themselves on their second LP in 1967, and then reworked by rap group [[Run DMC]] in the mid 1980s. His \"[[Different Drum]]\" and \"Some of Shelly's Blues\" were later recorded by [[Linda Ronstadt]] and the [[Stone Poneys]] in 1967 and 1968, respectively. \"Pretty Little Princess\", written in 1965, was recorded by [[Frankie Laine]] and released as a single in 1968 on [[ABC Records]].{{citation needed|date=December 2021}}  Later, \"Some of Shelly's Blues\" and \"Propinquity (I've Just Begun to Care)\" were made popular by the [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]] on their 1970 album ''[[Uncle Charlie & His Dog Teddy]]''.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\n===The Monkees===\n\n[[File:The Monkees 1966.JPG|left|upright|thumb|The Monkees in 1966 (Nesmith at bottom right)]]\n\nFrom 1965 to early 1970, Nesmith -- along with [[Micky Dolenz]], [[Peter Tork]], and [[Davy Jones (musician)|Davy Jones]] -- was a member of the television pop-rock band [[the Monkees]], created for the television [[The Monkees (TV series)|situation comedy of the same name]]. Nesmith won his role largely by appearing nonchalant when he auditioned.<ref name=\":0\"/> He rode his motorcycle to the audition, and wore a [[knit cap|wool hat]] to keep his hair out of his eyes; producers [[Bob Rafelson]] and [[Bert Schneider]] remembered the \"wool hat guy\" and called Nesmith back.{{citation needed|date=December 2021}}\n\nOnce he was cast, [[Screen Gems]] bought his songs so they could be used in the show. Many of the songs Nesmith wrote for the Monkees, such as \"[[The Girl I Knew Somewhere]]\", \"[[Mary, Mary (song)|Mary, Mary]]\",<ref name=\":0\"/> and \"[[Listen to the Band (song)|Listen to the Band]]\" became minor hits. One song he wrote, \"You Just May Be the One\", is in mixed meter, interspersing 5/4 bars into an otherwise 4/4 structure.{{citation needed|date=December 2021}}\n[[File:The Monkees May 1967.jpg|thumb|Nesmith (center) with [[The Monkees (TV series)|the Monkees]] in 1967]]\n\nEven before Colgems and [[Don Kirshner]]'s surreptitious release of the Monkees 2nd LP, without the knowledge or consent of the four musician-actors, they came to be frustrated by their studio-manufactured \"bubblegum\" image. Within weeks of the release of ''[[More of the Monkees]]'', Nesmith lobbied successfully with the group's creators, Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider, that the Monkees be allowed to play their instruments on future records. \nDuring a group meeting with Kirshner and Colgems lawyer Herb Moelis, in a suite at the [[Beverly Hills Hotel]], each actor received a $250k royalties check, yet Nesmith still threatened to quit. Moelis rebuked him, \"You'd better read your contract\". Nesmith defiantly punched a hole in the wall, declaring to Moelis, \"That could have been your face, motherfucker!\" Weeks later, due to a breach of (verbal) agreement over the next single release, which was promised to Nesmith by Rafelson & Schneider, Nesmith led the charge in completely ousting musical supervisor Don Kirshner, effectively giving the four youths complete artistic and production control of their output, and the group finally worked as a true 4-man rock group on 1967's ''[[Headquarters (the Monkees album)|Headquarters]]'', despite Jones & Dolenz having very limited instrumental skills, studio time being pricey and retakes costly.<ref name=\"Sandoval, Andrew 2001\"/>\n\nDuring the band's first independent press conference, Nesmith called their 2nd LP, ''[[More of the Monkees]]'' \"probably the worst record in the history of the world\", partly due to rushed, shoddy studio engineering. The band took a hit to its artistic credibility when fans learned the four had not played all the instruments on the first 2 LPs. But still sales continued to be profitable. ''Headquarters'' sold 2 million copies, down 2 million units from its predecessor, but still reached the number 1 spot on Billboard, falling only to ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' a week later and remaining #2 all through the entire 1967 [[Summer of Love]].<ref name=\"Sandoval, Andrew 2001\"/>\n\nFor the remaining five Monkees LPs, ironically, the original Kirshner formula of hired studio musicians & songwriters again became the norm, although Nesmith, Tork, Dolenz and Jones contributed about 50% of the original compositions, Nesmith the majority of those.<ref name=\"Sandoval, Andrew 2001\"/>\nBy the end of the Monkees run, Nesmith was withholding many of his original song ideas from Monkees albums, planning to release them in his post-Monkees solo career. \nNesmith's last contractual Monkees commitment was a commercial for [[Kool-Aid]] and [[Nerf]] balls in April 1970 (fittingly, the spot ends with Nesmith frowning and saying, \"Enerf's enerf!\"). As the band's sales declined, Nesmith asked to be released from his contract, despite it costing him: \"I had three years left ... at $150,000 [equivalent to $1.16 million in 2022] a year.\"{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} He remained in a financial bind until 1980, when he received his inheritance from his mother's estate. In a 1980 interview with ''[[Playboy]]'', he said of that time: \"I had to start telling little tales to the tax man while they were putting tags on the furniture.\"{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n====Return to the Monkees====\nNesmith did not participate in the Monkees' 20th anniversary reunion,<ref name=\":0\"/> due to contractual obligations with his production company, but he did appear during an encore with the three other Monkees at the [[Greek Theatre (Los Angeles)|Greek Theatre]] on September 7, 1986. In a 1987 interview for [[Nick Rocks]], Nesmith stated, \"When Peter called up and said 'we're going to go out, do you want to go?' I was booked. But, if you get to L.A., I'll play.\"<ref>Nick Rocks, January 1987 Profile of Michael Nesmith</ref>\n\nNesmith next joined his fellow Monkees for the 1986 \"Monkees Christmas Medley\" video for [[MTV]] appearing throughout dressed/disguised as [[Santa Claus]] until the finale, when he revealed his identity - and participation - to all.<ref>{{Cite web|via=[[YouTube]]|title=The Monkees - MTV Christmas Medley '86 (Better Source, Remastered) |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY1zZjYnp00 |access-date=2023-07-22 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote box\n |quote  = \"The question I am most often asked is 'how does it feel to be up with the guys after all this time?'

Prior to the official kickoff of The Monkees '89 tour (on July 1 in [[Winnipeg, Manitoba]], Canada) all four Monkees gathered in Los Angeles, California, making two live radio appearances ([[KLOS]]-FM: ''[[The Mark & Brian Show|The Mark and Brian Show]]'' on June 28 and [[KIIS-FM|KIIS]] Radio on June 30) to promote their reunion concert at the [[Universal Amphitheatre]] where they appeared together as a foursome live on stage on July 9.

He also wrote and directed a Monkees reunion television special, ''[[Hey, Hey, It's the Monkees]]''.

At the end of the final show, Nesmith announced his retirement from the Monkees, never to tour again.{{citation needed|date=December 2021}}\n\nIn 2018, Nesmith and Dolenz toured together as a duo for the first time under the banner \"The Monkees Present: The Mike and Micky Show\". The tour was cut short four dates out due to Nesmith having health issues (he was flown back home and proceeded to have [[quadruple bypass surgery]]). He contributed two songs to the Monkees' 13th studio album, ''[[Christmas Party (The Monkees album)|Christmas Party]]'' (the group's first Christmas album), released on October 12, 2018.{{citation needed|date=December 2021}}\n\nIn 2019, Nesmith and Dolenz reunited again to make up the cancelled dates of the tour and adding several more dates, including a planned tour of Australia and New Zealand.

London played on some of the earliest pre-Monkees, Nesmith 45s, as well as numerous Monkees sessions, and had 45s produced by Nesmith for the [[Dot Records|Dot label]] in 1969. Ware wanted Nesmith to put together a band. Nesmith's interest hinged on noted [[pedal steel guitar|pedal steel]] player [[Red Rhodes|Orville \"Red\" Rhodes]]; their musical partnership continued until Rhodes's death in 1995. The new band was christened Michael Nesmith and the First National Band and recorded three albums for [[RCA Records]], the first two issued in 1970 and the third released in 1971.{{citation needed|date=December 2021}}\n\nNesmith's First National Band is now considered a pioneer of country-rock music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.real.com/music/artist/Michael_Nesmith/ |title=Michael Nesmith - Country Rock - Rock/Pop - Music|website=Uk.real.com |access-date=May 14, 2010}}</ref> Nesmith wrote most of the songs for the band and he is considered one of the trailblazers of [[country rock]].<ref>[[Liner notes]] from the CD ''Hillbilly Fever, Volume 5'' released by [[Rhino Entertainment]] in 1995.</ref> He also had moderate commercial success with the First National Band. Their second single, \"[[Joanne (Michael Nesmith song)|Joanne]]\", hit number 21 on the ''Billboard'' chart, number 17 on Cashbox, and number four in Canada, with the follow-up \"Silver Moon\" making number 42 ''Billboard'', number 28 Cashbox, and number 13 in Canada. Two more singles charted (\"Nevada Fighter\" made number 70 ''Billboard'', number 73 Cashbox, and number 67 Canada, and \"Propinquity\" reached number 95 Cashbox), and the first two LPs charted in the lower regions of the'' Billboard'' album chart. No clear answer has ever been given for the band's breakup.{{citation needed|date=December 2021}}\n\nNesmith followed up with The Second National Band, which consisted of Nesmith (vocals and guitar), Michael Cohen (keyboards and [[Moog synthesizer|Moog]]), Johnny Meeks (of [[The Strangers (American band)|The Strangers]]) (bass), jazzer Jack Ranelli (drums), and Orville Rhodes (pedal steel), as well as an appearance by singer, musician, and songwriter [[José Feliciano]] on congas. The album, ''[[Tantamount to Treason Vol. 1]]'', was a commercial and critical disaster. Nesmith then recorded ''[[And the Hits Just Keep on Comin']]'', featuring only him on guitar and Red Rhodes on pedal steel.{{citation needed|date=December 2021}}\n\nNesmith then became more heavily involved in producing, working on [[Iain Matthews]]'s album ''[[Valley Hi]]'' and [[Bert Jansch]]'s ''[[L.A. Turnaround]]''. Nesmith was given a label of his own, Countryside, through Elektra Records, as [[Elektra Records]]'s Jac Holzman was a fan of Nesmith's. It featured a number of artists produced by Nesmith, including Garland Frady and Red Rhodes. The staff band at Countryside also helped Nesmith on his next, and last, RCA Victor album, ''[[Pretty Much Your Standard Ranch Stash]]''.  Countryside folded when [[David Geffen]] replaced Holzman, as Countryside was unnecessary in Geffen's eyes.{{citation needed|date=December 2021}}\n\nIn the mid-1970s, Nesmith briefly collaborated as a songwriter with [[Linda Hargrove (songwriter)|Linda Hargrove]], resulting in the tune \"[[I've Never Loved Anyone More]]\", a hit for [[Lynn Anderson]] and recorded by many others, as well as the songs \"Winonah\" and \"If You Will Walk With Me\", both of which were recorded by Hargrove. Of these songs, only \"Winonah\" was recorded by Nesmith himself.{{citation needed|date=December 2021}} During this same period, Nesmith started his multimedia company Pacific Arts, which initially put out audio records, [[8-track tape|eight-track]] tapes, and cassettes, followed in 1981 with \"video records\".

He also had a short-lived series (1984-5) on NBC inspired by the video called ''[[Television Parts|Michael Nesmith in Television Parts]]''. ''Television Parts'' included many other artists who were unknown at the time, but went on to become major stars in their own right: [[Jay Leno]], [[Jerry Seinfeld]], [[Garry Shandling]], [[Whoopi Goldberg]],<ref name=\":0\"/> and [[Arsenio Hall]]. The concept of the show was to have comics render their stand-up routines into short comedy films much like the ones in ''Elephant Parts''. Nesmith assembled writers [[Jack Handey]], [[William E. Martin|William Martin]], John Levenstein, and Michael Kaplan, along with directors [[William Dear]] (who had directed ''Elephant Parts'') and Alan Myerson, as well as producer Ward Sylvester to create the show. The half-hour show ran for 5 episodes in the summer of 1985 on [[NBC]] Thursday nights in prime time.{{citation needed|date=December 2021}}\n\n===Pacific Arts and legal dispute===\n{{further|Pacific Arts Corporation#PAC/PBS lawsuit}}\n\nNesmith formed the [[Pacific Arts Corporation]], Inc. in 1974 to manage and develop media projects. Pacific Arts Video became a pioneer in the [[home video]] market, producing and distributing a wide variety of videotaped programs, although the company eventually ceased operations after an acrimonious contract dispute with [[PBS]] over home video licensing rights and payments for several series,<ref name=\":0\"/> including [[Ken Burns]]' ''[[The Civil War (documentary)|The Civil War]]''. The dispute escalated into a lawsuit that went to jury trial in federal court in Los Angeles. On February 3, 1999, a jury awarded Nesmith and his company Pacific Arts $48.875&nbsp;million in [[compensatory damages|compensatory]] and [[punitive damages]], prompting his widely quoted comment, \"It's like finding your grandmother stealing your stereo. You're happy to get your stereo back, but it's sad to find out your grandmother is a thief.\" Six months after the verdict, a settlement was reached with the amount paid to Pacific Arts and Nesmith kept confidential.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Wold |first1=Robert N. |title=PBS and Nesmith settle home-video dispute but are mum on price |url=https://current.org/1999/07/pbs-and-nesmith-settle-home-video-dispute-but-are-mum-on-price/?iMonezaUT=b4c50a09-f660-4652-886e-b67f3ecef34c%7c638281963338673821%7c638598187338673821%7coKJD5DuAICLsyi9ymhhPY8FNBh9w3ZdJYN5rxNqsqGo&iMonezaLT=Sp9L3OsJpk5fClAMa5VEPEvxWFcL4t5X# |access-date=21 August 2023 |work=[[Current (newspaper)|Current]] |date=July 19, 1999}}</ref>\n\nNesmith's most recent Pacific Arts project was Videoranch 3D, a virtual environment on the internet that hosted live performances at various virtual venues inside the ranch.
