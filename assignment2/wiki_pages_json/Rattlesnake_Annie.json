Rattlesnake reminisced of those early days: \"I was breaking down barriers. If I could work like a man in the fields, why couldn't I play a guitar and produce my own records?\"<ref name=ram/>\n\nBecause of promotion and her focus for International music, her first album became popular in Europe. In the mid-1970s, she became the first female country blues singer/guitarist songwriter to play in the [[Eastern Bloc]] countries of Europe.
