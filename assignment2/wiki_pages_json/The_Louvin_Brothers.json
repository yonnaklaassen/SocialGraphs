The brothers are cousins to [[John D. Loudermilk]], a [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]] member.\n\nThe brothers wrote and performed [[country music|country]], [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]], and [[gospel music]]. Ira played [[mandolin]] and generally sang lead vocal in the [[tenor]] range, while Charlie played [[rhythm guitar]] and offered supporting vocals in a lower pitch. They helped popularize the vocal technique of [[close harmony]] in country and country-rock.<ref name=\"CST\">{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Jon|title=Livin' Lovin' Losin' the Louvin's Way|publisher=Country Standard Time|date=October 2003|url=http://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/article.asp?xid=943|access-date=January 22, 2010}}</ref>\n \nAfter becoming regulars at the [[Grand Ole Opry]] and scoring a string of hit singles in the late 1950s and early '60s, the Louvin Brothers broke up in 1963 due in large part to Charlie growing tired of Ira's addictions and reckless behavior. Ira died in a traffic accident in 1965. They were inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] in 2001, and Charlie died of cancer in 2011.

They grew up listening to and singing [[shape note]] music, which influenced the rest of their musical output.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Cordelia's Dad Interviewed by Auger/Anvil |url=http://cordeliasdad.com/antiqueSite/anvilinter.html |access-date=2024-07-24 |website=cordeliasdad.com}}</ref> Their first foray into secular music was the minor hit \"The Get Acquainted Waltz\", recorded with [[Chet Atkins]].

When performing and drinking, Ira would sometimes become angry enough on stage to smash his mandolin when he was unable to tune it, and - when sober - glue it back together. His style was heavily influenced by [[Bill Monroe]], and his brother [[Charlie Monroe]], who had a tempestuous relationship with Ira, considered him one of the top mandolin players in Nashville.<ref>{{cite book|last=Louvin|first=Charlie|title=Satan Is Real|year=2012}}</ref>\n\nIn his [[The New York Times|''New York Times'']] review of Charlie's biography ''Satan Is Real'', Alex Abramovich said, \"Ira Louvin was a full head taller than his younger brother, played the mandolin like Bill Monroe, and sang in an impossibly high, tense, quivering tenor. Charlie strummed a guitar, grinned like a [[vaudevillian]], and handled the bottom register. But every so often, in the middle of a song, some hidden signal flashed and the brothers switched places — with Ira swooping down from the heights, and Charlie angling upward — and even the most careful listeners would lose track of which man was carrying the lead. This was more than close-harmony singing; each instance was an act of [[transubstantiation]].\"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/books/review/satan-is-real-the-story-of-the-louvin-brothers.html | work=The New York Times | first=Alex | last=Abramovich | title='Satan Is Real,' the Story of the Louvin Brothers | date=February 17, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 1963, fed up with Ira's drinking and abusive behavior, Charlie started a solo career,<ref name=\"DimeryLydon2010\"/> and Ira also went on his own.\n\nIra died on June 20, 1965, at the age of 41.
