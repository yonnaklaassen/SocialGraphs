Then \"Misty Blue\" - handed down to Burgess after being rejected by [[Brenda Lee]] - was shortly established as a trademark song for Burgess' prime influence [[Eddy Arnold]], whose version in the spring of 1967 not only reached No.&nbsp;3 C&W but became a regional pop hit reaching No.&nbsp;57 nationally.\n\n==1967 on==\nContinuing to record with Owen Bradley, Burgess placed seven more singles on the C&W chart but only the first two of these: \"Fifteen Days\" (#24) and \"Tear Time\" (#15) both 1967 reached the Top 40.\n\nBurgess association with Bradley and Decca Records ended in 1971; that same year she signed with Shannon a label owned by [[Jim Reeves]] Enterprises (Burgess was a close friend of Reeves' widow Mary Reeves).<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> Five of Burgess' single releases on Shannon appeared on the C&W chart with the 1973 duet with Bud Logan \"Wake Me Into Love\" providing a one-off return to the Top 40 at No.&nbsp;14.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/>\n\nIn 1975, Burgess left Shannon signing with [[RCA Records]], where her uneventful tenure lasted until 1978. In 1982, she ended her recording career with the album ''Could I Have This Dance'' on 51West a [[Columbia Records]] label. Burgess also worked on and off with Mary Reeves running the Jim Reeves Museum in Nashville.\n\nBurgess was [[lesbian]] and preferred to record love songs with no gender-specific references. She did sometimes agree to record songs such as \"Ain't Got No Man\", on condition that her producer Owen Bradley let her record a song she liked but he did not.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autostraddle.com/7-lesbian-country-musicians-whove-been-out-44213/|title=6 More Out Lesbian & Bisexual Country Musicians For Your Collection|website=Autostraddle.com|date=4 May 2010 |access-date=5 May 2010}}</ref> In September 1982, Burgess opened and operated a music venue called Track 9 located at 2025 8th Avenue South in Nashville.<ref>The Tennessean, September 18, 1982.</ref> Burgess was part of the local lesbian community, and lesbians frequented Track 9 during its existence.
