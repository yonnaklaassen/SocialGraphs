That same year, \"[[The Red Strokes]]\" became Brooks' first single to make the UK Singles Chart, reaching a high of No. 13; it was followed by \"[[Standing Outside the Fire]]\", which reached No. 23.

Brooks sold-out venues such as [[Birmingham]]'s [[National Exhibition Centre]] and London's [[Wembley Arena]], a feat never accomplished by an American country music artist. He also began the London radio station, [[Country 1035]]. Despite the disdain of the British media, Brooks' overall popularity in the country was evident, with a top disc jockey, [[Nick Barraclough]], referring to Brooks as Garth Vader (a play on [[Darth Vader]]) for his \"invasion\" of the charts and his success in the country genre.

The album included the duet \"[[In Another's Eyes]]\" with [[Trisha Yearwood]], which reached No. 2 on Hot Country Songs chart, and its first single, \"[[Longneck Bottle]]\", with [[Steve Wariner]], reached No. 1. The album spawned two additional number-one singles, \"[[Two Pina Coladas]]\" and \"[[Make You Feel My Love|To Make You Feel My Love]]\" (a [[Bob Dylan]] cover), which also was a top 10 hit on the [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks]] chart and was released on the [[Hope Floats: Music from the Motion Picture|soundtrack]] to the film, ''[[Hope Floats]]''.\n\nBrooks' first live album, ''[[Double Live (Garth Brooks album)|Double Live]]'' was released in 1998.
