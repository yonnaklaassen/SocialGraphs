Russell's mother said \"she was shocked, because he never spoke\".<ref name=\"Master\"/> Russell said he \"was born with 'spastic paralysis', now called [[cerebral palsy]]\". An injury at birth had damaged his second and third vertebrae, causing a slight paralysis in the right side of his body, most notably affecting three fingers on his right hand. This caused Russell to favor his left hand and develop his signature left-hand-dominant piano playing style.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://thechurchstudio.com/about/leon-russell/ | author=Nancy Ruth | title=Leon Russell: The Early Childhood Years|date=January 6, 2023 |access-date=May 26, 2024}}</ref> He said \"My chops have always been sort of weak ...

He then began piano lessons in [[Anadarko, Oklahoma|Anadarko]], a 38 mile trip to and from the family home. While still taking piano lessons, Russell learned the alto saxophone and cornet in his elementary school band.<ref name=\"Master\"/> He then learned to play the baritone horn.

He was always dressed in a suit and tie, with short hair and no beard! This was soon after he arrived in Los Angeles from Oklahoma. We would go through the same routine each time I started rehearsing the music. He would sit at the piano and he would always say, 'I don’t know what to play'. And I would say, 'Just wait and see if you feel something, and if you don’t it’s okay. I just like your energy at the sessions'. Well, he would always chime in with something special and affect the groove in a very Leon Russell way that was always unique. Leon was a wonderful musician and had a major effect on all of my recordings. His touch can be heard on many Tijuana Brass records, including \"Whipped Cream\" and \"A Taste of Honey\". To top it off, Leon was a true gentleman with a special talent and he was a person that I had a great feeling for\".<ref name=Alpert1/> In 1962 Russell played piano on [[Walter Brennan]]'s lp ''Old Rivers'', produced by Snuff Garrett.

Blank shot film footage for two years. Russell didn't care for the finished film and during the breakup of Shelter Records, traded his forgiveness of some of Cordell's loans in exchange for full ownership of the film. Russell would not allow the finished film to be shown, saying \"This film will never be seen in public\".\n  \n40 years later, a Disney movie changed Russell's mind. He explained \"After Les Blank died, his son, Harrod, came to see me, offering to recut the film and also digitize it to enhance the quality. Plus, I had recently seen a Disney movie, ''[[Saving Mr. Banks|Saving Mister Banks]]''. After watching that, I realized sometimes we just say no to be just saying no, and I realized I was being selfish about it\".
