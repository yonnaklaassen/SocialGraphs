She is known for a series of [[duet]] recordings made with [[George Jones]], [[Gene Pitney]] and [[Charlie Louvin]]. She is also a solo artist, having reached the top of the country charts in 1974 with the song, \"[[No Charge]]\". Born in Tennessee but raised in Alabama, Montgomery had a musical upbringing. Along with her two brothers (songwriters Carl and Earl Montgomery), she placed in a talent contest which brought her to the attention of [[Roy Acuff]]. For several years she toured the country as part of his band until she signed with [[United Artists Records]] in 1963.\n\nAt United Artists, Montgomery collaborated with George Jones on a series of duets. Their first was 1963's \"[[We Must Have Been Out of Our Minds]]\", which became a top five single on the country charts. For several years, Jones and Montgomery toured and recorded together. Among their other singles was \"[[What's in Our Heart (song)|What's in Our Heart]]\", \"[[Let's Invite Them Over]]\" and \"Party Pickin'\". Montgomery became more identified as a duet artist as the decade progressed. She recorded with both [[Gene Pitney]] and [[Charlie Louvin]] on several charting country singles. However, her solo career was overshadowed until she moved to [[Elektra Records]] in 1973. Her 1974 song about motherhood called \"No Charge\" became a commercial success in several genres. It was followed by a series of charting singles, including the top 20 \"[[Don't Let the Good Times Fool You (song)|Don't Let the Good Times Fool You]]\" (1975).\n\nMontgomery continued her solo career. In 1977, she reached the top 40 of the country charts again with a cover of the song, \"[[Angel of the Morning]]\". In the eighties, she released several recordings including the album ''I Still Care'' and the charting single \"Straight Talkin'\". In the nineties, Montgomery began working as a songwriter in the country music community. She wrote songs that were recorded by a series of artists. Among them was [[George Strait]], who recorded \"[[What Do You Say to That]]\", which became a top five country single. Montgomery has also continued sporadically releasing music as a country artist. Her most recent album was 2010's ''Things That Keep You Going'', issued on RPM Music.\n\n==Early life==\nMelba Joyce Montgomery<ref name=\"CM Encyclopedia\">{{cite book |last1=Oermann |first1=Robert K. |title=Country Music: The Encyclopedia |date=January 4, 2012 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=978-0199920839}}</ref> was born into a musical family in [[Iron City, Tennessee]], United States.
