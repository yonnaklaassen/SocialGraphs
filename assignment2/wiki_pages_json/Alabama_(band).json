The band was founded by [[Randy Owen]] ([[lead vocals]], [[rhythm guitar]]) and his cousin Teddy Gentry ([[Bass guitar|bass]], [[Backing vocalist|backing vocals]]). They were soon joined by another cousin, [[Jeff Cook]] ([[lead guitar]], [[fiddle]], and [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]]s). First operating under the name Wildcountry, the group toured the [[Southeast United States|Southeast]] bar circuit in the early 1970s, and began writing original songs. They changed their name to Alabama in 1977 and following the chart success of two singles, were approached by [[RCA Records]] for a recording deal.\n\nAlabama's biggest success came in the 1980s, when the band had 27 country No. 1 hits, seven multi-platinum albums, and received numerous major awards. Alabama's first single on RCA Records, \"[[Tennessee River (song)|Tennessee River]]\", began a streak of 21 country No. 1 singles, including \"[[Love in the First Degree (Alabama song)|Love in the First Degree]]\" (1981), \"[[Mountain Music (song)|Mountain Music]]\" (1982), \"[[Dixieland Delight]]\" (1983), \"[[If You're Gonna Play in Texas (You Gotta Have a Fiddle in the Band)]]\" (1984) and \"[[Song of the South (song)|Song of the South]]\" (1988). The band's popularity waned slightly in the 1990s, although they continued to produce hit singles and multi-platinum albums. Alabama disbanded in 2004 following a farewell tour and two albums of inspirational music, but reunited in 2010 and has continued to record and tour worldwide.\n\nThe band's blend of traditional [[country music]] and [[Southern rock]] combined with elements of [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]], [[folk music|folk]] and [[pop music]] gave it a [[crossover (music)|crossover]] appeal that helped lead to their success. They also [[concert|toured]] extensively and incorporated production elements such as lighting and sets inspired by [[rock concert]]s into their shows. The band has over 41 number-one country records on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts to their credit and have sold over 75&nbsp;million records, making them the [[List of best-selling music artists|most successful band in country music history]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.al.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2014/10/post_272.html|title=Teddy Gentry of the group Alabama will sing his songs and tell stories behind them at Samford University|newspaper=[[The Birmingham News]]|date=October 3, 2014|first=Cary|last=Estes|access-date=December 17, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217075942/http://www.al.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2014/10/post_272.html|archive-date=December 17, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2015/07/26/alabama-southern-drawl-first-album--14-years/30411243/|title=After 14 years, Alabama is back with 'Southern Drawl'|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|date=July 27, 2015|access-date=December 20, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222052347/https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2015/07/26/alabama-southern-drawl-first-album--14-years/30411243/|archive-date=December 22, 2017}}</ref> [[AllMusic]] credited the band with popularizing the idea of a country band and wrote that \"It's unlikely that any other country group will be able to surpass the success of Alabama.\"{{sfn|Erlewine|Woodstra|Bogdanov|Erlewine|1997|p=6}}\n\nAlabama was inducted into the [[Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum]] in 2019 and was awarded the first-ever Life Time Achievement Award from this institution.<ref>{{cite web |title=2019 Inductees |url=https://www.musicianshalloffame.com/inductees-2019/ |website=Musicians Hall of Fame & Museum |access-date=13 November 2019}}</ref> \n\nThey were inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum]] in 2005.\n\n==History==\n\n===1969–1979: Formation and early years===\n[[Image:FortPayneAir.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Alabama formed in [[Fort Payne, Alabama]] (seen here in 1999).]]\nAlabama was formed by guitarists Randy Owen and Jeff Cook, and bassist Teddy Gentry, three cousins born and raised near Fort Payne, Alabama, an area with strong country music roots.{{sfn|Stambler|Landon|2000|p=5}} Owen and Gentry grew up on separate [[cotton]] farms on [[Lookout Mountain]] (a plateau that stretches across northeastern Alabama, through northwest Georgia and into Tennessee), learning guitar together and singing in church before the age of six.{{sfn|Erlewine|Woodstra|Bogdanov|Erlewine|1997|p=4}} Gentry and Owen played in numerous groups during the 1960s, ranging from [[pop music|pop]] to [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]].{{sfn|Erlewine|Woodstra|Bogdanov|Erlewine|1997|p=4}} Cook joined the band in 1969 forming the group Young Country, which first jammed together around Christmas.{{sfn|Stambler|Landon|2000|p=5}} Cook also played in numerous other bands and was a [[rock and roll]] [[disc jockey]].{{sfn|Erlewine|Woodstra|Bogdanov|Erlewine|1997|p=4}} The three cousins all shared vocal duties, with another cousin, drummer Jackie Owen, completing the group's first lineup.{{sfn|Stambler|Landon|2000|p=5}} The band's first performance was at a high school talent contest (playing a [[Merle Haggard]] song), for which they won first prize and tickets to the [[Grand Ole Opry]].<ref name=\"usatoday\"/>{{sfn|Erlewine|Woodstra|Bogdanov|Erlewine|1997|p=4}} Despite this, all were too busy with prior commitments to pursue music: Owen still in high school, Cook working for [[Western Electric]], and Gentry laying carpets full-time.{{sfn|Stambler|Landon|2000|p=5}} The band grew further inactive when Cook and Owen went to college.{{sfn|Erlewine|Woodstra|Bogdanov|Erlewine|1997|p=4}}\n\nThe group became a professional band in 1972, adding drummer Bennett Vartanian and changing their name to Wildcountry.{{sfn|Erlewine|Woodstra|Bogdanov|Erlewine|1997|p=4}} During this time, the group accepted a position playing at the now-defunct Canyon Land theme park near Fort Payne.{{sfn|McCall|Rumble|Kingsbury|2012|p=5}}{{sfn|Stambler|Landon|2000|p=5}} The park would bring in established stars, such as [[Jerry Wallace]], [[Bobby Bare]], and [[Narvel Felts]], and the band would back them, afterwards performing a one-hour dance set.{{sfn|Stambler|Landon|2000|p=5}} After a while, with opportunities for the band slow to materialize, a discouraged Cook took a government job in [[Anniston, Alabama]].
