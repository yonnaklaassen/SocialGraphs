There he got a job at a music publishing company and, in 1997, he was aided by [[Bobby Braddock]] to obtain a production contract with [[Sony Music]].<ref name=\"AutoRD-1\" />\n\n== Music career ==\n=== 2001–2006: Beginnings ===\n[[File:Blake Shelton.jpg|thumb|right|Shelton performing at the Crawford County Fair in Meadville, PA, in August 2005]] Some years later in Nashville, he signed to Giant Records. In 2001, he was slated to release a song entitled \"[[I Wanna Talk About Me]]\" as a single. However, staff at the label considered the song unsuitable for a lead-off single, and the song was eventually recorded by [[Toby Keith]], whose version was a number 1 single.<ref name=\"rap\" />\n\nInstead, Giant released \"[[Austin (Blake Shelton song)|Austin]]\" as Shelton's debut single. Shortly after that song was released, Giant Records was closed, and Shelton was transferred to parent company [[Warner Bros. Records]]. \"Austin\" became Shelton's first number-one hit on the ''Billboard'' Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) charts and spent five weeks at that position. Warner released Shelton's [[Blake Shelton (album)|self-titled debut album]], which was produced by songwriter [[Bobby Braddock]]. It also produced the Top 20 hits \"[[All Over Me (Blake Shelton song)|All Over Me]]\", which Shelton co-wrote with [[Earl Thomas Conley]] and Mike Pyle, and \"[[Ol' Red]]\".<ref name=\"allmusic\" /> Although Shelton's rendition of \"Ol' Red\" was not a major radio hit, he considers it his [[signature song]], and it has become popular in [[concert]].<ref name=\"AutoRD-3\" /> The album received a platinum certification from the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) for shipments of 1,000,000 copies.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Gold & Platinum |url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&ar=Blake+Shelton&ti=#search_section |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161223202821/http://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&ar=Blake+Shelton&ti=#search_section |archive-date=December 23, 2016 |access-date=March 14, 2017 |publisher=RIAA}}</ref>\n\nThe album received a positive review from Maria Konicki Dinoia of [[Allmusic]], who called \"Austin\" \"tremendously imaginative\" and praised Shelton for including songs written by Braddock and Conley.<ref name=\"AutoRD-4\" /> ''[[Country Standard Time]]'' was less favorable, with Scott Homewood saying that the \"album just smacks of being assembled with the intent on capturing the burgeoning alternative country market\".<ref name=\"AutoRD-5\" />\n\nShelton's second album, ''The Dreamer'', was first released on February 4, 2003, on Warner Bros. Records. Its lead-off single, \"The Baby\", reached No. 1 on the country charts, holding that position for three weeks. Although the second and third singles (\"Heavy Liftin'\" and \"Playboys of the Southwestern World\", respectively) only reached No. 32 and No. 24, ''The Dreamer'' earned gold certification, as well. He, along with [[Andy Griggs]] and [[Montgomery Gentry]], sang guest vocals on [[Tracy Byrd]]'s mid-2003 single \"[[The Truth About Men (song)|The Truth About Men]]\". ''Blake Shelton's Barn & Grill'' was the title of Shelton's third studio album, released in 2004.<ref name=\"allmusic\" /> Its lead-off single, the [[Harley Allen]] co-write \"When Somebody Knows You That Well\", peaked at No. 37 on the country charts, while the follow-up \"Some Beach\" became his third No. 1 hit, holding that position for four weeks.

It was the lead single on Shelton's EP, ''Hillbilly Bone'', released on March 2, 2010, through [[Reprise Records]] Nashville.
