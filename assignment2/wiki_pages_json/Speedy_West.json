He frequently played with [[Jimmy Bryant]], both in their own duo and as part of the regular [[Capitol Records]] backing band for [[Tennessee Ernie Ford]] and many others. The duo also recorded with non-Capitol artists in Los Angeles. In 1960, Speedy played on and produced [[Loretta Lynn]]'s first single. During his time at Capitol, he played on over 6000 recordings, including pop records by artists like [[Frank Sinatra]] and [[Bing Crosby]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news |agency=Associated Press |date=2003-11-24 |title=Speedy West, 79, Steel-Guitar Innovator |language=en-US |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/24/arts/speedy-west-79-steel-guitar-innovator.html |access-date=2023-01-02 |issn=0362-4331}}</ref> West, who began playing [[Paul A.
