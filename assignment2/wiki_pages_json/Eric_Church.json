Church worked with his father at Clayton Marcus, a furniture upholstery company where his father was president.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.furnituretoday.com/article/519425-pulaski-plans-eric-church-furniture-line|title=Pulaski plans Eric Church furniture line - Furniture Today|website=Furnituretoday.com|date=8 May 2015|access-date=5 October 2018}}</ref> At 13, he bought a guitar and began writing songs of his own. By his senior year of high school, he had found a gig at a local bar, which occupied most of his time. He played many [[Jimmy Buffett]] cover songs and a few of his own original songs in some dive bars. Some of these places were so rough that he got into a few altercations from the stage. For a few years, the band played often in bars and restaurants throughout North Carolina.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} The band \"Mountain Boys\" consisted of his college roommate, brother, and a fellow guitarist.<ref name=\"allmusic\" />\n\nBefore moving to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], Eric graduated from [[South Caldwell High School]] and then [[Appalachian State University]] with a degree in [[marketing]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/301808/eric-church/biography |title=Eric Church biography\n|magazine=Billboard\n|access-date=2016-07-17 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820212033/http://www.billboard.com/artist/301808/eric-church/biography |archive-date=2016-08-20 }}</ref> Upon graduation, Church became engaged to a [[Spanish language|Spanish]] teacher in the town of [[Lenoir, North Carolina]]. The future bride's father attempted to persuade Church into a corporate career, which he rejected as an aspiring musician (and later referenced in his song \"What I Almost Was\" from his debut album). She broke the engagement and he headed to Nashville with his father's financial backing. His father also provided the opportunity to make contacts, and more importantly, time to focus on developing his songwriting ability.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n==Music career==\n===2006–2010: ''Sinners Like Me'' and ''Carolina''===\nChurch co-wrote [[Terri Clark]]'s 2005 single \"The World Needs a Drink\",<ref name=\"allmusic\" /> and the track \"Whiskey Wings\" on [[Dean Miller]]'s 2005 album ''[[Platinum (Dean Miller album)|Platinum]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/platinum-mw0000208385|title=''Platinum'' review|last=Deming|first=Mark|work=Allmusic|access-date=29 August 2012}}</ref> He started recording with different producers.

An additional track from the album, \"Lightning\", was made into a [[music video]] despite not being released as a single.

He was replaced by Taylor Swift, who was just starting her career. Before Swift started the tour, Church and Swift spoke, where he told Swift that she would thrive on the tour and joked that she should give him her first gold record as a thanks. Swift later did give him her first gold record with an attached note that said \"Thanks for playing too long and too loud on the Flatts tour. I sincerely appreciate it.
