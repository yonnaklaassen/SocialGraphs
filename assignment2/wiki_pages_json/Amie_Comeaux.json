Her debut album, ''Moving Out'', was released on [[Polydor Records]] in 1994, and it produced the single \"Who's She to You\", a No.&nbsp;64 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country charts. Two posthumous albums, ''A Very Special Angel'' and ''Memories Left Behind'', were issued in 1998 and 2007, respectively.\n\n==Early life==\nComeaux first began singing at nursing homes and weddings as a child. When she was nine years old, she sang the [[Star-Spangled Banner]] at a [[New Orleans Saints]] game in the [[Louisiana Superdome]], and continued to do so throughout her teenage years. Comeaux was also chosen to play the lead role in ''[[Annie (musical)|Annie]]'' at the [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]] Little Theater.\n\n==Career==\nRecord producer [[Harold Shedd]] had been working with Comeaux since she was ten years old, helping her with her singing skills.<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/amie-comeaux-mn0000747865/discography |title=Amie Comeaux &#124; Album Discography |website=[[AllMusic]] |date=1998-06-30 |accessdate=2020-03-22}}</ref><ref name=\"wire\">{{cite web |url=http://weeklywire.com/ww/01-12-98/nash_music-industry.html |title=\"Before Her Time\": Country music loses Amie Comeaux |accessdate=2008-01-07 |last=Keel |first=Beverly |date= 1998-01-12 |work=Nashville Scene}}</ref>\n\nIn 1993, she was signed to [[Polydor Records]] label. A year later, her debut album ''Moving Out'' was released;<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> however, Polydor closed its doors soon afterward, and Comeaux was left without a record deal. [[Toby Keith]], who was also on Polydor at the time, had offered to help with Comeaux's second album before the label's closure.<ref name=\"wire\"/>\n\n==Death==\nOn December 21, 1997, Comeaux was returning home with her grandmother and her godchild, Megan, from a [[Christmas]] family gathering in [[Alabama]]. As Comeaux passed a car, her own automobile [[hydroplaning (tires)|hydroplaned]] due to heavy rain and struck a tree. She was killed instantly.<ref>{{cite news|title=Brusly singer dies in car wreck|date=December 22, 1997|work=[[The Advocate (Louisiana)|The Advocate]]}}</ref> Comeaux's grandmother and godchild were injured in the crash and were hospitalized for some time, but both survived. She was buried in Grace Memorial Park Cemetery in [[Plaquemine, Louisiana]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Briefs|date=December 23, 1997|work=The Advocate}}</ref>\n\nComeaux's posthumous album ''A Very Special Angel'' was released March 6, 1998, by Rival Records of [[Nashville, Tennessee]], but due to printing errors, the album had to be repackaged and was re-released 20 days later. Comeaux had co-written some of the songs on the album. A second posthumous album, ''Memories Left Behind'', was released in 2007. This album was dedicated to Comeaux's mother, who died in August 2006.\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:14em;\"| Title\n! style=\"width:18em;\"| Album details\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Moving Out''\n| \n* Release date: October 18, 1994\n* Label: [[Polydor Records|Polydor Nashville]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''A Very Special Angel''\n| \n* Release date: June 30, 1998\n* Label: Contraband\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Memories Left Behind''\n| \n* Release date: October 24, 2006\n* Label: Beaujo Music\n|}\n\n===Singles===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Year\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:12em;\"| Single\n! colspan=\"2\"| Peak chart<br />positions\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Album\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n! style=\"width:45px;\"| [[Hot Country Songs|US Country]]\n! style=\"width:45px;\"| [[RPM (magazine)|CAN Country]]\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 1994\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Moving Out\"<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Billboard/90s/1994/BB-1994-09-10.pdf|title=Single Reviews|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=September 10, 1994}}</ref>\n| —\n| —\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" rowspan=\"3\"| ''Moving Out'' \n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Who's She to You\"\n| 64\n| 58\n|-\n| 1995\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Blue\"\n| —\n| —\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" style=\"font-size:8pt\"| \"—\" denotes releases that did not chart\n|}\n\n===Music videos===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!
