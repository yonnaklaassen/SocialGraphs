She got her start performing on radio stations in the [[Oklahoma City]] area; and by age 12, she had her own radio show on [[KRMP|KLPR-AM]]. She toured Oklahoma with various bands, starting with [[Merl Lindsay]] and His Oklahoma Night Riders at age 16, followed by the Bill Gray Band at 18.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> Norma Jean was the Bill Gray Band's full-time vocalist, and made guest appearances with major country stars. Early on, she befriended soon-to-be country star [[Wanda Jackson]].\n\nIn 1955, she got a regular spot on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC-TV]] show ''[[Ozark Jubilee]]'' in [[Springfield, Missouri]], where she stayed for two years and first received national exposure.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> Host [[Red Foley]] suggested calling her simply Norma Jean, and she made it official in 1958;<ref>Sachs, Bill \"Folk Tunes & Talent\" (June 30, 1958), ''[[Billboard (magazine)|The ''Billboard'']], p. 46</ref> she also became known on the program as '''Pretty Miss Norma Jean'''. She met [[Porter Wagoner]] on the show, and in 1959, signed a recording contract with [[Columbia Records]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/> A string of unsuccessful singles followed, and she moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], where Wagoner invited her to audition for his syndicated weekly TV program, ''The Porter Wagoner Show''.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> She became a regular on the show in 1961 and stayed for six years.<ref>{{cite web\n| title = The Porter Wagoner Show\n| url = http://www.tv.com/shows/the-porter-wagoner-show/\n| publisher = TV Guide\n| access-date = July 10, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n| title = The Porter Wagoner Show\n| url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0162822/fullcredits#cast\n| publisher = IMDB\n| access-date = July 10, 2012}}</ref>\nNorma Jean toured and performed across the country with Wagoner, and RCA Victor producer [[Chet Atkins]] signed her to a recording contract with RCA Victor.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\n===Success in the 1960s===\nIn 1963, Norma Jean released her first single with RCA Victor, \"Let's Go All the Way\".<ref name=\"AMG\"/> The song peaked at number 11 on the ''Billboard'' country chart.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> She released an album of the same name which spawned two more Top 40 hits, \"I'm a Walking Advertisement (For the Blues)\"<ref name=\"AMG\"/> followed by \"Put Your Arm Around Her.\" Because of the singles' success, she was invited to join the [[Grand Ole Opry]].<ref>{{cite web\n| title = Opry Timeline - 1956s\n| url = http://www.opry.com/about/Timeline_1960.html\n| access-date = July 10, 2012\n| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190527234706/https://www.opry.com/about/Timeline_1960.html\n| archive-date = May 27, 2019\n| url-status = dead\n}}</ref>\n\nIn late 1965, she released an album titled, ''Pretty Miss Norma Jean'' (titled after how Wagoner frequently introduced her on his television show).<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Country Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1993|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-726-6|page=292/3}}</ref> It was the most successful of her career, hitting number three on the Top Country Albums list. The first single from the album, \"Go Cat Go\", became a Top 10 hit, peaking at number eight.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> Two more singles were released, starting with \"I Cried All the Way to the Bank,\" which also proved successful. After that, \"I Wouldn't Buy a Used Car From Him\", written by [[Harlan Howard]], was another Top 10 hit, making her one of the most popular female country singers of the era.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nFrom 1965 to 1967, Norma Jean produced a series of solid country singles and albums and continued to appear on Wagoner's show.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> On television she projected a wholesome image, contrary to her singing hurting and cheating songs relevant to her personal life, which included an affair with Wagoner.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nNorma's biggest hit came in 1966. It was an unusual recording with [[Bobby Bare]] and [[Liz Anderson]], \"The Game of Triangles\", a wife-husband-other woman drama that hit number five on the ''Billboard'' chart,<ref name=\"AMG\"/> and earned the trio a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] nomination.\n\nNorma Jean left Wagoner's show in 1967 after marrying Jody Taylor<ref name=\"AMG\"/> (whom she later divorced), and was replaced by newcomer [[Dolly Parton]], who went on to become one of country music's leading female stars.  Parton said later she had a hard time replacing Norma Jean, because she was so loved by country fans.\n\nThat year, her single, \"Heaven Help the Working Girl\" (an early feminist song) was a Top 20 hit, the last one of her career.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> Despite a lack of major country hits, her albums continued to sell, like 1967's ''Jackson Ain't a Very Big Town'', which peaked at number 11 on the Top Country Albums list.  She later struggled with alcoholism and became a [[born again]] Christian.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\n==Discography==\n{{main|Norma Jean discography}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060107210356/http://www.slipcue.com/music/country/countryartists/normajean.html Norma Jean annotated discography at Slipcue.com]\n\n{{Grand Ole Opry members}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Norma Jean}}\n[[Category:1938 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:People from Lincoln County, Oklahoma]]\n[[Category:American women country singers]]\n[[Category:American country singer-songwriters]]\n[[Category:Singer-songwriters from Oklahoma]]\n[[Category:Grand Ole Opry members]]\n[[Category:RCA Victor artists]]\n[[Category:Country musicians from Oklahoma]]\n[[Category:21st-century American women]]"
