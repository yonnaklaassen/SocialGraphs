The hero who kisses old ladies and dogs and was kind to everybody. I decided it was time to be an [[antihero]].\"<ref>[[#Hughes|Hughes]], p. 4</ref> Eastwood was instrumental in creating the [[Man with No Name]] character's distinctive visual style and, although a non-smoker, Leone insisted Eastwood smoke cigars as an essential ingredient of the \"mask\" he was attempting to create for the character.<ref name=\"McG131\">[[#McGilligan|McGilligan]], p. 131</ref>\n\n''A Fistful of Dollars'' proved a landmark in the development of [[spaghetti Western]]s, with Leone depicting a more lawless and desolate world than traditional westerns, and challenging American stereotypes of a western hero with a morally [[ambiguous]] antihero. The film's success made Eastwood a major star in Italy<ref name=Mercer/> and he was rehired to star in ''[[For a Few Dollars More]]'' (1965), the second of the trilogy. Through the efforts of screenwriter [[Luciano Vincenzoni]], the rights to ''For a Few Dollars More'' and the trilogy's final film, ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]'' (1966), were sold to [[United Artists]] for about $900,000.<ref name=\"McG148\">[[#McGilligan|McGilligan]], p. 148</ref>\n\nIn January 1966, Eastwood met producer [[Dino De Laurentiis]] in New York City and agreed to star in a non-Western five-part anthology production, ''[[The Witches (1967 film)|The Witches]]'' (''Le Streghe'', 1967), opposite De Laurentiis's wife, [[Silvana Mangano]].<ref name=\"McG150\">[[#McGilligan|McGilligan]], p. 150</ref> Eastwood's 19-minute installment took only a few days to shoot, but his performance did not please critics; one wrote, \"no other performance of his is quite so 'un-Clintlike'\".<ref name=\"McG151\">[[#McGilligan|McGilligan]], p. 151</ref>\n\nTwo months later Eastwood began work on ''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'', again playing the mysterious Man with No Name. [[Lee Van Cleef]] returned as a ruthless fortune seeker, with [[Eli Wallach]] portraying the Mexican bandit Tuco Ramirez. The storyline involved the search for a cache of [[Confederate gold]] buried in a cemetery.
