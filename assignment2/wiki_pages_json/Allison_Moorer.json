She signed with [[MCA Nashville]] in 1997 and made her debut on the U.S. [[Billboard Country Chart]] with the release of her debut single, \"A Soft Place to Fall\", which she co-wrote with [[Gwilym Emyr Owen III|Gwil Owen]]. The song was featured in [[Robert Redford]]'s ''[[The Horse Whisperer (film)|The Horse Whisperer]]'' and was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] in 1999. Moorer performed at the Oscars ceremony the same year. She has made ten albums and her songs have been recorded by [[Trisha Yearwood]], [[Kenny Chesney]], [[Miranda Lambert]], [[Steve Earle]], and [[Hayes Carll]].\n\n== Early life ==\nMoorer was born in [[Mobile, Alabama]] on June 21, 1972.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.allison-moorer.com/bio.html|title=Biography|website=Allison-moorer.com|access-date=October 28, 2019}}</ref> She was raised in [[Frankville, Alabama]], and later [[Monroeville, Alabama]], after the deaths of her parents. Growing up, Moorer and her sister also lived in [[Jackson, Alabama]] at various times.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Moorer|first=Allison|title=Blood: A Memoir|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=2019|isbn=978-0-306-92268-8}}</ref>  Music was an important part of the Moorer family. Moorer's father was a heavy drinker who abused his wife. In 1985, her mother fled with the two girls to nearby Mobile, but her father soon discovered their whereabouts. In 1986, when Moorer was 14 and her older sister Shelby (now [[Shelby Lynne]]) was 17, he shot and killed his wife before taking his own life.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.npr.org/2010/12/15/132082946/shelby-lynne-and-allison-moorer-musical-sisters | title=Shelby Lynne and Allison Moorer: Musical Sisters | publisher=NPR | date=December 15, 2010}}</ref> Moorer graduated from the [[University of South Alabama]] in Mobile in June 1993 and then moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], without even collecting her diploma to join her sister, singer/songwriter Shelby Lynne, who lived there and had already released three albums. Moorer began singing backgrounds in Lynne's band full time and toured extensively with her.\n\n== Career ==\nIn June 1996, Moorer took part in a tribute to her songwriter friend, the late [[Walter Hyatt]], singing his \"Tell Me Baby\" at Nashville's [[Ryman Auditorium]]. Nashville agent Bobby Cudd was in attendance and subsequently introduced her to renowned producer and MCA Nashville president [[Tony Brown (record producer)|Tony Brown]]. After a few meetings, Brown asked her to cut some demos for the label. Two tracks—\"Pardon Me\" and \"Call My Name\"— from that session were included on her first MCA album, ''[[Alabama Song (album)|Alabama Song]]''.\n\nWhen Brown moved from [[MCA Records]] to sister label [[Universal South]], Moorer followed. Her 2002 album, ''[[Miss Fortune (album)|Miss Fortune]]'', earned more raves, but didn't meet sales expectations. It contained the ballad \"Tumbling Down,\" which was featured on the soundtrack of the popular 2002 film ''[[The Rookie (2002 film)|The Rookie]]''.\n\nHer live album [[Show (Allison Moorer album)|''Show'']] was recorded in one night at 12th and Porter in Nashville.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Allison Moorer – Show |url=https://www.nodepression.com/album-reviews/allison-moorer-show/ |access-date=February 19, 2023 |website=No Depression |language=en-US}}</ref> It features the first recorded collaboration between Moorer and Lynne. After releasing ''Show'' and a DVD on Universal South, Moorer moved to independent label [[Sugar Hill Records (bluegrass label)|Sugar Hill Records]]. With a slightly rougher edge than past efforts, ''[[The Duel (Allison Moorer album)|The Duel]]'' was released in April 2004. Moorer's first husband, Doyle Lee Primm, was featured as a songwriter on her first four albums. They divorced in 2005. After serving as his opening act on a European tour, Moorer married fellow singer/songwriter [[Steve Earle]]. Earle produced her 2006 album, ''[[Getting Somewhere]]''. Moorer wrote all the songs, with the exception of one co-written with Earle. They were both nominated for the Best Country Collaboration with Vocals Grammy, for the song \"Days Aren't Long Enough\" from Earle's ''Washington Square Serenade'' in 2008. The song was also nominated for an [[Americana Music Association]] award. Moorer gave birth to the couple's first child, John Henry Earle, on April 5, 2010,<ref>{{Cite web |date=June 6, 2011 |title=Steve Earle: Hardcore Troubador Page 3 |url=https://www.stereophile.com/content/steve-earle-hardcore-troubador-page-3 |access-date=February 19, 2023 |website=Stereophile.com |language=en}}</ref> but they separated in 2012 and divorced in 2015.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Hattenstone |first=Simon |date=June 14, 2017 |title=Steve Earle: 'My wife left me for a younger, skinnier, less talented singer' |language=en-GB |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jun/14/steve-earle-so-you-wanna-be-an-outlaw-interview |access-date=February 19, 2023 |issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\nMoorer released the [[Buddy Miller]]-produced ''Mockingbird'' in February 2008;[4] an album mainly of covers of songs by female singer/songwriters including her sister, Shelby Lynne.\n[[File:Allison Moorer.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Moorer performing in 2009]]\nIn 2009, Moorer performed in ''[[The People Speak]]'', a documentary feature film that uses dramatic and musical performances of the letters, diaries, and speeches of everyday Americans, based on historian [[Howard Zinn]]'s ''A People's History of the United States''.[5] She appeared in the off-Broadway ''Rebel Voices'', a dramatization of Howard Zinn and Anthony Arnove's ''Voices of a People's History of the United States'' in late 2007. Also, in 2009, she appeared on the [[BBC]] series ''[[Transatlantic Sessions]]'', Series 4, Episodes 4 and 5, performing a version of the Irish folk song, \"Carrickfergus\". She toured with the [[Jerry Douglas]] and Ally Bain led Transatlantic Sessions band in early 2011.\n\nIn 2015, Moorer released her ninth album, ''Down to Believing'', which marked a return to collaborating with [[Kenny Greenberg]].\n\nIn August 2017, Moorer released her tenth album, ''Not Dark Yet'', in collaboration with her sister. Produced by British folk singer [[Teddy Thompson]], it featured covers of songs by [[Merle Haggard]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] and [[The Killers]] as well as one original song written by Moorer and Lynne, \"Is It Too Much.\" During an extended interview at the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]], the duo revealed that they were planning a second collaborative album which would instead feature all original material and that they were to begin writing together for the new project in 2018.\n\nMoorer co-produced the 2019 [[Hayes Carll]] record ''[[What It Is (Hayes Carll album)|What It Is]]''.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Gage |first=Jeff |date=February 26, 2019 |title=Hayes Carll on Harnessing Humor, Dance-Hall Vibe of New Album 'What It Is' |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/hayes-carll-times-like-these-video-800244/ |access-date=February 19, 2023 |magazine=Rolling Stone}}</ref> She and Carll were married on May 12, 2019.<ref>{{Cite web |date=May 14, 2019 |title=Hayes Carll and Allison Moorer Get Married |url=https://www.thecountrydaily.com/2019/05/14/hayes-carll-and-allison-moorer-get-married/ |access-date=February 19, 2023 |website=The Country Daily}}</ref> Moorer's album ''Blood'' was to be released October 25, 2019; her book, ''Blood: A Memoir'', was scheduled for publication on October 29, 2019, on [[Da Capo Press]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/allison-moorer-new-album-memoir-blood-the-rock-and-the-hill-873608/|title=Allison Moorer Previews New Album and Memoir With Visceral Song 'The Rock and the Hill'|first1=Stephen L.|last1=Betts|publisher=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=August 19, 2019}}</ref> \n\nIn May 2024, Moorer announced that she had taken a job as a writer-editor at the [[Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum]].<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Willman |first1=Chris|title=Allison Moorer on Setting Performing Aside to Take a Job With the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum: 'It's a Way to Give Back to What Saved Me'|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=May 10, 2024 |url=https://variety.com/2024/music/news/allison-moorer-country-music-hall-fame-museum-1235998654/|access-date=11 May 2024}}</ref>\n\n== Discography ==\n=== Studio albums ===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!
