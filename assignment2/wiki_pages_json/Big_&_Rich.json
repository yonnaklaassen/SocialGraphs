Before the duo's foundation, Rich was bass guitarist in the country band [[Lonestar]], while Kenny was a solo artist for [[Hollywood Records]].\n\nTheir first studio album, ''[[Horse of a Different Color (Big & Rich album)|Horse of a Different Color]]'', was released in 2004. This album produced four straight Top 40 country hits, including the number 11 \"[[Save a Horse (Ride a Cowboy)]]\", plus collaborations with [[Cowboy Troy]], [[Gretchen Wilson]], and [[Martina McBride]]. ''[[Comin' to Your City]]'' was released in November 2005, followed by another Top 20 single the [[Vietnam War]]-inspired \"[[8th of November (song)|8th of November]]\" and two more Top 40 hits. Joining the duo on this album were Cowboy Troy, Wilson, and [[Kris Kristofferson]]. ''[[Between Raising Hell and Amazing Grace]]'', released in 2007, produced their only No.&nbsp;1 single, \"[[Lost in This Moment]]\". Both before and during the duo's hiatus, Rich has worked as a producer and songwriter for several other artists.\n\nAfter this album, both members went on hiatus and released solo albums in 2009—Big Kenny's ''[[The Quiet Times of a Rock and Roll Farm Boy]]'' and Rich's ''[[Son of a Preacher Man (John Rich album)|Son of a Preacher Man]]''. These also produced the duo's first Top 40 solo entries—Big Kenny with \"[[Long After I'm Gone]]\" and Rich with \"[[Shuttin' Detroit Down]]\". In 2010, Big Kenny released his second solo country album, ''Big Kenny's Love Everybody Traveling Musical Medicine Show Mix Tape, Vol. 1'' and in 2011, Rich released the [[extended play]]s ''[[For the Kids (EP)|For the Kids]]'' and ''[[Rich Rocks]]'', the latter of which included the Top 40 country single \"Country Done Come to Town\". Big & Rich reunited in May 2011 to release \"Fake ID\", a cut from the soundtrack to the 2011 film ''[[Footloose (2011 film)|Footloose]]''. A year later, the duo released their fourth album, ''[[Hillbilly Jedi]]'', which produced the Top 20 hit \"[[That's Why I Pray]]\". In July 2013, Rich announced that the duo had begun work on their fifth studio album, ''[[Gravity (Big & Rich album)|Gravity]]'', which was released independently.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=http://theboot.com/big-and-rich-new-studio-album/?trackback=fbshare_top |title=Big & Rich Working on New Studio Album |date=July 12, 2013 |publisher=Theboot.com |access-date=2014-08-10}}</ref><ref name=\"E2.ma\">{{cite web |url=http://e2.ma/message/5e6mg/5qzdaj |archive-url=https://archive.today/20140129003732/http://e2.ma/message/5e6mg/5qzdaj |url-status=dead |archive-date=2014-01-29 |title=email : Webview : Big News from Big & Rich! |publisher=E2.ma |access-date=2014-08-10 }}</ref> Another independent album, ''Did it For the Party'', was announced in 2017 for release in September, led by the single \"California\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tasteofcountry.com/big-rich-did-it-for-the-party-new-album-details/|title=Big & Rich Reveal Details for 'Did It for the Party' Album|website=Taste of Country|date=July 8, 2017 |access-date=March 18, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nPrior to Big & Rich's foundation, [[John Rich]] was a founding member of the band Texassee, which later became [[Lonestar]].<ref name=\"allmusic lonestar\">{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p165799|pure_url=yes}} |title=Lonestar biography |access-date=March 7, 2010 |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |author-link=Stephen Thomas Erlewine |publisher=Allmusic}}</ref> Rich played bass guitar in the band and alternated with [[Richie McDonald]] on lead vocals; he also co-wrote their singles \"[[Come Cryin' to Me]]\" and \"[[Say When (song)|Say When]]\".<ref name=\"fourteen\">Rich, Big Kenny, Rucker, p. 14</ref> After Lonestar released their second studio album, Rich departed from the band in 1998, leaving McDonald as the band's sole lead singer.<ref name=\"usa\">{{cite web |url=http://www.usanetwork.com/series/nashvillestar/theshow/characterprofiles/rich/index.html |title=Character profile: John Rich |access-date=August 19, 2010 |work=USA Networks |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110215083929/http://www.usanetwork.com/series/nashvillestar/theshow/characterprofiles/rich/index.html |archive-date=February 15, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Kenny Alphin (aka [[Big Kenny]]) was signed to [[Hollywood Records]] in 1998,<ref>Rich, Big Kenny, Rucker, p. 11</ref> where he recorded a [[rock music|rock]] album called ''[[Live a Little (Big Kenny album)|Live a Little]]'' a year later.<ref name=\"scene1\">{{cite news|url=http://www.nashvillescene.com/2000-11-16/stories/feeling-the-luv/|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130129115928/http://www.nashvillescene.com/2000-11-16/stories/feeling-the-luv/|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 29, 2013|title=Feeling the Luv After departing Hollywood Records, \"Big Kenny\" Alphin moves on|last=Murray|first=Noel|date=November 16, 2000|work=Nashville Scene|page=1|access-date=February 25, 2010}}</ref>  Although one of its songs was featured in the soundtrack to the film ''[[Gun Shy (2000 film)|Gun Shy]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r461655|pure_url=yes}}|title=''Gun Shy Soundtrack'' review|last=Phares|first=Heather|publisher=Allmusic|access-date=February 25, 2010}}</ref> ''Live a Little'' was not released, and Hollywood Records held the rights to the songs for five years.<ref name=\"scene1\"/> In the meantime, [[The Mavericks]] recorded one of Alphin's songs (\"I Hope You Want Me Too\") on their 1998 album ''[[Trampoline (The Mavericks album)|Trampoline]]'',<ref>{{cite AV media notes |title=Trampoline |others=The Mavericks |year=1998 |type=CD booklet |publisher=[[MCA Nashville]] |id=3804562}}</ref> and [[Danni Leigh]] recorded his \"Beatin' My Head Against the Wall\" on her album ''[[29 Nights]]''.<ref>{{cite AV media notes |title=29 Nights |others=Danni Leigh |year=1998 |type=CD insert |publisher=Decca Records |id=70032}}</ref> Big Kenny then befriended Rich after meeting him at a club,<ref name=\"fourteen\"/> and the two began writing songs together.
