In 1988, McCue moved to [[Melbourne]] and took guitar lessons from [[Bruce Clarke (musician)|Bruce Clarke]].\n\n== Music career ==\nMcCue is a singer, songwriter, guitarist, multi-Instrumentalist, music-recording producer, engineer, and video director.\n\n=== Early bands ===\nMcCue's first band was based in Sydney and was called ''Vertigo'' after the Alfred Hitchcock film.\n\nIn 1988 in Melbourne, answering an ad in the local press, she joined all-female rock band [[Girl Monstar]] as lead guitarist (1988–1993). The band had two Number One hits on the Australian Independent Charts and eventually received an [[Australian Recording Industry Association|ARIA]] nomination for best independent act.\n\nFollowing her stint with Girl Monstar, she played acoustically around Melbourne, later performing in [[Vietnam]] for a year before returning to Melbourne to record her [[Laughing EP]] (1996). She then joined Australian female trio [[Eden A.K.A.]], who signed to [[Columbia Records]] in the USA. Eden A.K.A. released the album ''Eden'' in 1998,<ref>{{cite web| publisher=[[Discogs]]| title=Eden A.K.A.| url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/2407618-Eden-AKA |accessdate=20 July 2019}}</ref> and performed in Canada and the USA at the [[Lilith Fair]] in 1998 and 1999.\n\n=== Solo and band-leader success ===\n[[File:Anne McCue plays lapsteel.jpg|thumb|right|Anne McCue plays lapsteel]]\nAfter signing with L.A. based manager, [[Mike Gormley]], McCue's first solo album, ''Amazing Ordinary Things'', was released in 1999 in Canada and Japan, and she toured with a number of well-known musicians, including a US tour with [[Lucinda Williams]], who would often introduce McCue as \"my new favorite artist... and an amazing guitarist\". Williams later included McCue on her Starbucks' 'Artist's Choice' compilation alongside [[Paul Westerberg]], John Coltrane, Ryan Adams, Patti Griffin and [[Leonard Cohen]].\n\nMcCue's success on the Lucinda Williams tour prompted the release of a live album, ''[[Live: Ballad of an Outlaw Woman]]'', recorded at [[The Fillmore]] in [[San Francisco, California]], and her first Messenger Records release, ''Roll''.\n\n''Roll'' also received numerous critical accolades, with ''[[Los Angeles Weekly]]'' stating that the Australian performer had more \"all-American authenticity than a dozen [[Martina McBride]]s\" and ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' drawing comparisons to Lucinda Williams and Canadian alt-country singer [[Kathleen Edwards]].  [[Bob Harris (radio)|Bob Harris]] from the [[BBC]] went as far as to call it his album of the year, and she toured internationally to promote the album. {{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nMcCue released her album ''Koala Motel'' on Messenger Records in 2006. She completed an international tour to promote the album. She relocated from Los Angeles to Nashville.

The album is a return to her early days in music. In an interview, she noted, \"In my earlier existence as a young guitar player in Melbourne, I wanted to be a  jazz guitar player. I was studying jazz guitar. I was making my living playing jazz music, more like singing and playing guitar. ...  So for me [Blue Sky Thinkin'] was more like going back to that. ... I love the guitar tone of that era. I love the sound of the recordings. To me it’s very warm sounding.  I don’t think it’s ever sounded better than that. So I was trying to get those sounds. I’ve listened to Charlie Christian a lot. And also to Django [Reinhardt ]. It was just natural. I didn’t force it. I didn’t tell myself I’m going to make a Charlie Christian type song or do a Django song. I just wanted to do it. I’ve played that stuff a lot and I wanted to write songs in that style.\"<ref>from an interview on [http://americanamusicshow.com/episode235 Americana Music Show #235], published on March 3, 2015.</ref>\n\n===Assisting other musicians===\nMcCue produced and recorded two albums for other artists in 2009 – Tracey Bunn's \"By The Wayside\" and Denise DeSimone's \"Pray Peace\".
