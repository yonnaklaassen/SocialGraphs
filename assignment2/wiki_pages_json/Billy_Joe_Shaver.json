The two divorced and remarried several times.<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\nShaver took a job at a lumber mill to make ends meet. One day, his right (dominant) hand became caught in the machinery, and he lost the better part of two fingers and contracted a serious infection. He eventually recovered, and taught himself to play the guitar without the missing fingers.<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\n[[File:Billy joe shaver BuffaloNY Dec2011.jpg|thumb|Shaver lost two fingers in a sawmill accident when he was young.<ref name=autogenerated3>{{cite news\n | last = Greene\n | first = David\n | title = Billy Joe Shaver Writes Country Songs — And Lives Them, Too\n | newspaper = NPR Morning Edition\n | date = August 5, 2014\n | url = https://www.npr.org/2014/08/05/336615368/billy-joe-shaver-writes-country-songs-and-lives-them-too\n | access-date = August 5, 2014}}</ref>]]\nShaver set out to hitchhike to Los Angeles. He could not get a ride west, so he went to the other side of the highway and headed east, accompanying a man who dropped him off just outside [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. The next ride brought him to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], where he found a job as a songwriter for $50 per week.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> His work came to the attention of [[Waylon Jennings]], who filled most of his album ''[[Honky Tonk Heroes]]'' with Shaver's songs after meeting in a travel trailer at Willie Nelson's 4 July picnic. Other artists, including [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Kris Kristofferson]], began to record Shaver's music. This led to him getting his own record deal.\n\nThe first few recording companies he signed with soon folded.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> He was never able to gain widespread recognition as a singer, although he never stopped recording his own music. On his records, he has been accompanied by other major rock and country musicians such as [[Willie Nelson]], [[Nanci Griffith]], [[Chuck Leavell]] and [[Dickey Betts]] (of the [[Allman Brothers]]), [[Charlie Daniels]], [[Flaco Jiménez]], and [[Al Kooper]].\n\nAfter losing his wife, Brenda, and his mother to cancer in 1999, Shaver lost his son and longtime guitarist [[Eddy Shaver]], who died at age 38 on December 31, 2000. The listed cause of death was a heroin overdose, but there were suspicious circumstances surrounding the case as his face was bruised as if he had been punched multiple times, and the daughter of an Austin police officer was at the residence at the time. Folk country artist [[Todd Snider]] wrote and dedicated his song \"Waco Moon\" to Eddy. Shaver nearly died the following year when he had a heart attack on stage during an [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] show at [[Gruene Hall]] in [[New Braunfels, Texas]]. After successful heart surgery, Shaver came back to release ''[[Freedom's Child]]'' in 2002.\n\nIn 1999, Shaver performed at the [[Grand Ole Opry]]. In November 2005, he performed on the ''CMT Outlaws'' in 2005. In 2006, Shaver was inducted in the [[Texas Country Music Hall of Fame]]. He later served as spiritual advisor to Texas independent gubernatorial candidate [[Kinky Friedman]]. For his efforts, the Americana Music Convention awarded him their Lifetime Achievement Award in Songwriting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.puremusic.com/shaver1.html |title=Billy Joe Shaver |website=Puremusic.com |access-date=February 24, 2013}}</ref> He lived in Waco, Texas.\n\n[[Bob Dylan]] mentioned Shaver in his song \"I Feel a Change Comin' On\" (Bob Dylan and [[Robert Hunter (lyricist)|Robert Hunter]]) on the album, ''[[Together Through Life]]'' (2009) – \"I'm listening to Billy Joe Shaver, And I'm reading James Joyce\". Shaver is also the \"hero\" of the song, \"Why Can't I Write Like Billy Joe\" on the album ''Stormy Love'' by [[Bugs Henderson]].\n\nShaver's voice is heard on the themes to the [[Adult Swim]] television show ''[[Squidbillies]]''. The opening themes are only a stanza long and end with a ''[[sotto voce]]'' spoken-word portion. Season 1 Episode 5 of [[Mike Judge]]'s ''Tales From The Tour Bus'' features the life of Shaver.\n\n=== Death ===\nShaver died on October 28, 2020, from a [[stroke]] at the age of 81.<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Hudak |first1=Joseph |last2=Doyle |first2=Patrick |date=October 28, 2020 |title=Billy Joe Shaver, Seminal Outlaw Country Songwriter, Dead at 81 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/billy-joe-shaver-songwriter-dead-obituary-1082610/ |access-date=October 28, 2020 |website=Rollingstone.com}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n{{Main|Billy Joe Shaver discography}}\n\n==Most notable recordings==\n[[File:Billy Joe Shaver May 2015.jpg|thumb|Shaver performing in 2015]]\nShaver's debut album, ''Old Five and Dimers Like Me'' (1973), contained many songs noted for being performed by other artists that were written by him, such as [[David Allan Coe]] and [[Waylon Jennings]].
