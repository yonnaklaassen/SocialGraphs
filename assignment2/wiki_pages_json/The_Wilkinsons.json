Founded in 1997, the group consisted of lead singer [[Amanda Wilkinson]], her brother Tyler Wilkinson, and their father, Steve Wilkinson. The Wilkinsons achieved success late in 1998 with the hit single \"[[26 Cents]]\", a Number One on the Canadian country music charts and Top 5 hit on the U.S. ''Billboard'' Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now [[Hot Country Songs]]) charts. It was followed by \"[[Fly (The Angel Song)]]\", also a No.&nbsp;1 in Canada. A second album, ''[[Here and Now (The Wilkinsons album)|Here and Now]]'', produced the group's last American top 40 hit in \"Jimmy's Got a Girlfriend\". Afterward, the trio recorded three more albums, one of which was not released, and a Greatest Hits package.\n\nAs of 2023, Amanda and Tyler Wilkinson will still perform together occasionally as \"The Wilkinsons\" without their father, who has retired.\n\n==History==\n===Beginnings===\nSteve Wilkinson was born on August 18, 1955, in [[Belleville, Ontario]], Canada.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thewilkinsons.tv/bios.htm|title=The Wilkinsons &#124; An Original Family.

He took menial jobs in order to provide for his family, but his real passion was music. They signed to [[Giant Records (Warner)|Giant Records]] in 1998.\n\n===Breakthrough===\nThe Wilkinsons' first album, ''[[Nothing But Love (album)|Nothing But Love]]'', reached No.&nbsp;16 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Top Country Albums charts in 1998. The trio was nominated for the [[Country Music Association]]'s Horizon Award and Vocal Group of the Year and for Single of the Year by the [[Academy of Country Music|Academy of Country Music Awards]]. Their second album, ''[[Here and Now (The Wilkinsons album)|Here and Now]]'', won the [[Canadian Country Music Association]] award for Best Album. The band has received nine Canadian Country Music Awards, one [[Juno Award]] and two [[Grammy]] nominations (both for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group).<ref>[http://www.winspearcentre.com/content.asp?contentid=645&catid=20&rootid=6 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060521000459/http://www.winspearcentre.com/content.asp?contentid=645&catid=20&rootid=6 |date=May 21, 2006 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-wilkinsons-mn0000574637 |title=The Wilkinsons &#124; Biography, Albums, & Streaming Radio |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2015-11-08}}</ref>\n\n===Move to BNA Records===\nIn 2001, Giant closed its Nashville division while \"I Wanna Be That Girl\" was climbing, leading to the band's third Giant album (''Shine'') being shelved.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1N1-0FF6790DEA54796C.html|title=The Wilkinsons carry on after collapse of record company - Post-Tribune (IN) &#124; HighBeam Research|date=March 9, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309133317/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1N1-0FF6790DEA54796C.html|archive-date=2016-03-09}}</ref> Shortly thereafter, the trio was signed to [[BNA Records]]. Weeks before the release of their first single for BNA, the label's president wanted Amanda to record a solo album, which would ultimately disband the trio. The trio eventually left the label and signed with the independent Canadian label [[Open Road Records]] for their 2005 album, ''[[Highway (The Wilkinsons album)|Highway]]''.\n\nThe group's last studio album, \"Home\", was released on March 20, 2007.\n\n===Solo work===\nAmanda Wilkinson signed with [[Universal South Records]] and released her solo debut album, ''Amanda Wilkinson''.
