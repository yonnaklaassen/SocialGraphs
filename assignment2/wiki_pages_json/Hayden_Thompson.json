Thompson then joined the Dixie Jazzlanders who toured Mississippi.  He relocated to [[Memphis, Tennessee]] and made an unreleased recording in 1956.  \"Love My Baby\" was issued on the Phillips International label in September 1957, and Thompson toured alongside [[Sonny Burgess]] and [[Billy Lee Riley]].  The following year, Thompson moved again, this time to [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], where he gained a residency at the Rivoli Ballroom, Chicago's latest country music venue.<ref name=\"Larkin50\"/>\n\nThompson's recording of \"$16.88\" for [[Kapp Records]] sold sufficiently to secure him an offer to record his debut album.  ''Here's Hayden Thompson'' was released in 1967.  Several recordings took place in the early-1970s, but circumstances meant that Thompson left the music industry at this point and worked as a limo driver.  He re-emerged in the mid-1980s, becoming a regular performer on rockabilly revival touring packages.  Charley Records released an album of his in 1985.<ref name=\"Larkin50\"/>  Further albums were released, mainly by various European record labels, over the three decades. These included ''The Time Is Now'' (1990).<ref name=\"Larkin50\"/>\n\n==Albums==\n{| border=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"4\" rules=\"all\"  style=\"margin:1em 1em 1em 0; border-style:solid; border-width:1px; border-collapse:collapse; empty-cells:show;  \"\n|- bgcolor='#FFDEAD'\n!Year\n!TITLE/track listing\n!Catalog number\n|----\n|bgcolor='#E0E0E0' colspan='4' align='left'|<big>'''[[Kapp Records]] (US)'''</big>\n|----\n|1967\n|''Here's Hayden Thompson''\nLife's Gone And Slipped Away / You Don't Have To Be A Baby To Cry / I'll Kiss You Again / Tell Me That's The Way It Will Be / We Know / Sixteen Eighty-Eight / Blue Blue Day / Waiting on Her / These Boots Are Made For Walkin' / Why / Look Who's Coming / And She Cried\n|KL-1507 (LP)\n|----\n|bgcolor='#E0E0E0' colspan='4' align='left'|<big>'''Charly Records (UK)'''</big>\n|----\n|1985\n|''Booneville Mississippi Flash''\nAh Poor Little Baby / Drivin' Me Out of My Mind / Born To Lose / Had A Little Talk / Don't Say That You're Sorry / I'm Gonna Sit Right Down And Cry / Eenie Meenie Minie Mo / Hands of Time / The Boy From Tupelo / I Wanna Get Home / A Girl Named Betty / When My Blue Moon Turns To Gold Again\n|CR 30245 (LP)\n|----\n|bgcolor='#E0E0E0' colspan='4' align='left'|<big>'''Sunjay Records (SWE)'''</big>\n|----\n|1985\n|''The Rockin' Country Man''\nAh Poor Little Baby / Drivin' Me Out of My Mind / Born To Lose / Had A Little Talk / Don't Say That You're Sorry / I'm Gonna Sit Right Down And Cry / Eenie Meenie Minie Mo / Hands of Time / The Boy From Tupelo / I Wanna Get Home / When My Blue Moon Turns to Gold Again / A Girl Named Betty<small><br />reissue of Charly CR 30245</small>\n|SJLP 563 (LP)\n|----\n|1990\n|''The Time Is Now''\nPretty Little Love Song / Wishful Thinking / Fried Chicken / Wrong Road Again / At The Party Tonight / I Still Miss Someone / Ain't That Loving You Baby / Tell Me That's The Way It'll Be / I Ain't Taking No Prisoners / Stonecold Heart / Careless Hands / Boy From Tupelo\n|SJLP 589 (LP)\n|----\n|bgcolor='#E0E0E0' colspan='4' align='left'|<big>'''Spark Records (HOL)'''</big>\n|----\n|1990\n|''The Time Is Now''\nPretty Little Love Song / Wishful Thinking / Fried Chicken / Wrong Road Again / At The Party Tonight / I Still Miss Someone / Ain't That Loving You Baby / Tell Me That's The Way It'll Be / I Ain't Taking No Prisoners / Stonecold Heart / Careless Hands / Boy From Tupelo<small><br />reissue of Sunjay SJLP 589</small>\n|CD 13 (LP)\n|----\n|bgcolor='#E0E0E0' colspan='4' align='left'|<big>'''[[St. George Records]] (USA)'''</big>\n|----\n|2005\n|''Rockabilly Rhythm''\nMama's Little Baby / Love My Baby / Rockabilly Boogie / Reelin' & Rockin' / Milk Cow Blues Boogie / Let's Get Gone / Sugar-Coated Love / Boppin' High School Baby / Chicago River Blues / Hang Out / Can't Hardly Stand It / Gonna Rock & Roll Tonight / Boppin' The Blues / Blue Moon of Kentucky\n|STG 7714 (CD)\n|----\n|bgcolor='#E0E0E0' colspan='4' align='left'|<big>'''Bluelight Records (FIN)'''</big>\n|----\n|2007\n|''Hayden Thompson''\nSorrow Break A Good Man Down / Black Cloud / Big River / Just To Satisfy You / I've Got It Again / Sixteen Dollars Eighty-eight Cents / Midnight Blues / I'd Run A Mile To You / I Wanna Get Home / Ninety Seven More To Go / Drive Me Out of My Mind / Four Strong Winds / No Love Have I / Still Nineteen / Mystery Train a.k.a.
