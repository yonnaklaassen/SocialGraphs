When he was 16, Brad won a National Talent Contest during Country Music Week in [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] in 1982.<ref>[https://esask.uregina.ca/entry/johner_brad_1969-.html Brad Johner (1969- )]</ref><ref name=autogenerated>[http://www.countrymusicnews.ca/news.ihtml?step=2&article_id=333 Country Music News Canadian country Music Artists CD's CDs CD Nashville report<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> He spent six years maintaining his solo career before teaming up with his brother Ken to form [[The Johner Brothers]] in 1988. After 14 years, six albums (including their ''Greatest Hits''), 26 singles, one [[Canadian Country Music Association]] (CCMA) award and more than 40 awards from the Saskatchewan Country Music Association (SCMA), including Entertainer of the Decade, Ken decided to retire from the music business to pursue other interests in 2002.\n\nAfter the Johner Brothers dissolved, Brad returned to his solo career. He moved to [[Saskatoon]] with his wife Rhea and their five sons to begin work on his first solo album with producer Bart McKay.<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.countrymusicnews.ca/news.ihtml?step=2&article_id=333 Country Music News Canadian country Music Artists CD's CDs CD Nashville report<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The album, ''[[Free (Brad Johner album)|Free]]'', was released by [[Royalty Records]] in 2003.
