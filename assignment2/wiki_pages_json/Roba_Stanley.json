She was the daughter of Robert Morland Stanley, an old-time fiddler who recorded with her on some of her records.<ref name=encyclopedia/>\n\n==Early life==\nStanley was born as Roba Mary Stanley. Stanley's father was an old-time music fiddler and she was exposed to the music in the home.<ref name=messengers>[http://www.bluegrassmessengers.com/roba-stanley-.aspx Bluegrass Messengers, Roba Stanley Biography, with interview excerpts.]</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://daculaga.gov/history/ |title=History - City of Dacula Historical Events |website=daculaga.gov |accessdate=April 8, 2021}}</ref>\n\nStanley learned to play the guitar and sing in the home and by 1923 (at age 15) went with her father to square dances.<ref name=messengers/>\n\nTheir home was \"a mecca\" for early country music near Atlanta, due to her father's prowess as a fiddler.<ref name=messengers/> He was the winner of the Georgia Old-Time Fiddlers Convention in 1920.<ref name=messengers/> Among the friends he brought to the house was [[Fiddlin' John Carson|Fiddlin' Johnny Carson]], whom Roba remembered playing music with at her house.<ref name=messengers/>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Music===\n\n====Recording====\nRoba recorded for Okeh Records in 1924 and 1925, performing solo and as part of her family's '''Stanley Trio'''.<ref name=FarawayHills/> She also made records with Bill Patterson.<ref name=FarawayHills/>\n\nOf her four July 1924 recordings, two were labeled \"Roba Stanley and Bill Patterson\" and the other two were \"The Stanly Trio\".<ref name=FarawayHills/> With Patterson she made ''Devilish Mary'' and ''Mr. Chicken''.<ref name=FarawayHills/> With the trio she made ''Nelie Grey'' and ''Whoa Mule!''<ref name=FarawayHills/>\n\nShe recorded three more in December 1924, ''All night long'' (Roba and her father Bob Stanley), ''Little Frankie'' (with Bill Patterson), and ''Railroad Bill'' (with her father Bob Stanley and with Bill Patterson).<ref name=FarawayHills/>\n\nHer last record, in July 1925, was solo. She made ''Old Maid Blues'' and ''Single Life''.<ref name=FarawayHills/>\n\n====Performing====\nShe performed live on [[Country music in Atlanta|Atlanta's]] WSB radio for a year.<ref name=FarawayHills/> She went on to perform off the air with other Georgia musicians, including [[Gid Tanner]] and  her father Bob Stanley (himself a fiddler, winner of one of the Georgia Fiddler's Conventions).<ref name=FarawayHills/>\n\n====Family====\nHer music career ended when she married<ref name=FarawayHills/> Frank Ellsworth Baldwin and moved to Florida with him.<ref name=headstone/> She was no longer near a recording studio and her husband did not like her performing in public, so she gave away her guitar.<ref name=headstone/>\n\n==Age when she first recorded==\n\n===Either 14 or 16 years old===\nThere has been some concern over her age at the time she recorded. One article that mentioned the concern said she was either 14 or 16, and probably was called the latter to avoid child labor laws.<ref name=FarawayHills/> Another says that research revealed her to be born in 1910; however the research itself was not identified.<ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/artist/roba-stanley-mn0000237916 AllMusic article about Roba Stanley]</ref>\n\n===Evidence for age 16 at recording time===\nCensus records indicate that she would have been 16 at the time she recorded in 1924. From the census, we know she was born between January 17 and April 28 of 1908. That would make her 16 in the July 1924 recording session. Additionally, her family listed her birth date as February 11, 1908,<ref name=headstone/> which supports the census data.\n\n====Census specifics====\nRoba was listed as being two years old in the April 25, 1910 U.S. Census<ref name=1910census>[http://search.ancestry.com/iexec?htx=View&r=an&dbid=7884&iid=31111_4327493-00892&fn=Ruby&ln=Stanley&st=r&ssrc=&pid=147256032 U.S. Census, Online at Ancestry (subscription required) Year: 1910; Census Place:  Dacula,  Gwinnett,  Georgia; Roll:  T624_194; Page:  10A; Enumeration District:  0060; Image:  892; FHL microfilm:  1374207.]</ref> and eleven years old in the January 16, 1920 Census.<ref name=1920census>[http://search.ancestry.com/iexec?htx=View&r=an&dbid=6061&iid=4300118_00288&fn=Robie&ln=Stanley&st=r&ssrc=&pid=63944827 U.S. Census, Online at Ancestry (subscription required) Year: 1920; Census Place:  Dacula,  Gwinnett,  Georgia; Roll:  T625_260; Page:  6A; Enumeration District:  73; Image:  288.]</ref> She had not reached her birthday in the 1920 calendar year when the census was taken.
