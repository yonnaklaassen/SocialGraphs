She finished as the fifth place finalist on the fifth season of ''[[Nashville Star]].'' She has released one studio album and has charted on the U.S. [[Hot Country Songs]] chart with \"When I Said I Would\" and \"Skinny Dippin',\" as well as a Christmas single and guest appearance on a [[Kenny Rogers]] single which was released before her ''Nashville Star'' appearance. In the fall of 2011, Duncan competed on the 23rd season of ''Survivor'', ''[[Survivor: South Pacific]]'', where she ultimately finished in 9th place, becoming the fourth member of the jury. In the fall of 2014, Duncan and her then-fiancÃ©, fellow ''Survivor: South Pacific'' castaway Keith Tollefson, competed together on the [[The Amazing Race 25|25th season]] of ''[[The Amazing Race (American TV series)|The Amazing Race]]'', where they placed in 8th place.\n\n==Early life==\nDuncan was born on August 3, 1984, in [[Scotts Hill, Tennessee]], a town consisting of only 900 people. Her father is a [[environmentalist|state environmentalist]] and her mother is a schoolteacher. Her grandfather introduced her to music.<ref name=\"whitney\">{{cite web|url=http://www.whitneyduncan.com/page/about-whitney-duncan |title=Whitney Duncan info |publisher=Whitney Duncan.com |access-date=September 5, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908082522/http://www.whitneyduncan.com/page/about-whitney-duncan |archive-date=September 8, 2008 }}</ref>\nDuncan began singing at her church, later performing in local talent shows, fairs, and festivals. She would also travel to the neighboring states of [[Kentucky]] and [[Missouri]] to perform at events. In her early teens, she began to travel to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p691649/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Whitney Duncan biography|last=Leggett|first=Steve|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=September 5, 2008}}</ref> to perform at local clubs, including Tootsie's Lounge.<ref name=\"whitney\"/>\n\n==Music career==\nIn her senior year of high school, Duncan signed a recording contract with a label, cutting a few songs she had written. One of these songs was \"My World Is Over\", which became a duet with [[Kenny Rogers]], and appeared on his ''[[42 Ultimate Hits]]'' album in 2004.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> A single was made of their duet, and charted for one week on the Billboard [[Hot Country Songs]] chart in July 2004.  Afterwards, Duncan parted ways with the label.<ref name=\"cmt\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/duncan__whitney/bio.jhtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914101120/http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/duncan__whitney/bio.jhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 14, 2008|title=CMT biography â€“ Whitney Duncan|publisher=[[Country Music Television]]|access-date=September 5, 2008}}</ref> In 2006, she opened for the CMA Music festival, performing the [[Star Spangled Banner|national anthem]] and singing the next day as well.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://countrymusic.about.com/od/nashvillestar5/ig/Nashville-Star-5-Finalists/Whitney-Duncan.htm|title=Meet the top 10 finalists for Nashville Star season 5|magazine=Country Standard Time|access-date=September 5, 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, Duncan participated on the [[USA network]] show ''[[Nashville Star]]'' and self-released her debut album. After coming in fifth place, she signed to [[Warner Bros. Records]] Nashville. Her first solo single, \"When I Said I Would\" was released from the label in August 2008,<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> peaking at No.&nbsp;48 on the U.S. country charts. The second single, \"The Bed You Made,\" followed in December 2008 and failed to chart. The third single, \"Skinny Dippin\" was released in July 2009, and debuted at No.&nbsp;60 and reached No.&nbsp;48 as well. A [[Christmas]] digital single, a [[cover version]] of the [[Mariah Carey]] hit \"[[All I Want for Christmas Is You (Mariah Carey song)|All I Want for Christmas Is You]]\", was issued in November 2008. A digital [[extended play|EP]] titled ''Selections From Right Road Now'' was released in December 2008.\n\nDuncan's debut album, ''Right Road Now'', was originally slated for a May 2009 release, but was pushed back due to the lackluster success of the singles. The album was released digitally and through [[Amazon.com]] on compact disc on April 20, 2010.\n\nDuncan's song \"So Sorry Mama\" is featured in the 2011 movie ''[[Footloose (2011 film)|Footloose]]'', and on its soundtrack. She sang and co-wrote \"So Sorry Mama\" with John Shanks and Gordie Sampson. \"So Sorry Mama\" was also on her ''Right Road Now'' CD released on Warner Brothers in 2010. Duncan released a new single called \"That's How You Make Love\" on July 31, 2012.\n\nIn 2016, Duncan founded the band Post Monroe with Ashlee Hewitt and Shelby McLeod but in late 2017 the band became a duo after Shelby departed the group.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://postmonroe.com/|title=Postmonroe - Benefits of Hybrid Cars to the environment|website=Postmonroe.com}}</ref>\n\n==''Survivor''==\nBeginning September 2011, Duncan appeared as a contestant on the [[CBS]] reality television series, ''[[Survivor: South Pacific]]'', as part of the Savaii tribe. Duncan quickly formed a very close, romantic bond with her fellow tribemate Keith Tollefson, and the two teamed up with Jim Rice and another pair within the tribeâ€”[[Ozzy Lusth]] and [[Elyse Umemoto]]â€”early on in the game.  At the urging of Rice, Duncan cooperated in the elimination of Umemoto to limit Lusth's power.\n\nAt the merge, Duncan and the rest of the old Savaiis were betrayed by former tribemate [[John Cochran (Survivor contestant)|John Cochran]], which led to the entire former Savaii tribe being voted out one by one. Duncan herself was voted out on Day 27 after having barely lost a challenge that would have kept her safe for another round; Duncan and another one of her former Savaii colleagues Dawn Meehan then lost the Redemption Island duel the next day against Lusth, officially eliminating both Duncan and Meehan from the game. Duncan finished ninth overall and was the fourth member of the jury, where she was later one of the six jury members who voted for [[Sophie Clarke]] to win the season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.com/shows/survivor/video/2099637560/survivor-south-pacific-meet-whitney|title=Survivor: South Pacific â€“ Meet Whitney|publisher=[[CBS|CBS.com]]|access-date=August 22, 2011}}</ref>\n\nSeveral years later, in the official issue of ''[[CBS Watch]]'' magazine commemorating the 15th anniversary of ''Survivor'', Duncan was voted by viewers as the fifth most attractive female contestant in ''Survivor'' history.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/zGd9NWD9h6/ |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/iarchive/s/instagram/zGd9NWD9h6 |archive-date=December 24, 2021 |url-access=limited|title=Brenda Lowe on Instagram: \"Voted \"steamiest\" by the Survivor fans...

His 2010 song \"American Made\" makes reference to her as \"a Tennessee Girl that will always have a place in my heart.\" Duncan co-wrote (with her cousin Jonathan Singleton) \"Making Circles,\" which also appeared on Kane's 2010 album, The House Rules.\n\nDuncan married musician Donny Fallgatter on August 1, 2010, in [[Gatlinburg, Tennessee]], after two months of dating.<ref name=divorce>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20545518,00.html?xid=rss-topheadlines|title=Whitney Duncan (Almost!)
