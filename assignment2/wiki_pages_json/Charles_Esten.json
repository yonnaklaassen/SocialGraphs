Following graduation, Esten moved to the United Kingdom to make his [[theatre|theatrical]] debut, playing the title role in the musical ''[[Buddy - The Buddy Holly Story|Buddy]]'' in the early 1990s.<ref name=\"GQ\"/>\n\nEsten's first television appearance was in December 1988 as a contestant on the [[NBC]] game show ''[[Sale of the Century]]'' (under the name Chip Puskar).

At the time, the show needed a second specialist improvisational singer to fill in for [[Mike McShane]].\n\nEsten made his final appearance in the UK edition in 1994 before moving back to the US. Although appearing on stage and screen thereafter, his 1999 return to ''[[Whose Line Is It Anyway?

Due to his singing abilities, he was often paired with series regular [[Wayne Brady]] on musical games. Although he did not return as a regular when the show was revived in 2013 and only appeared as a special guest during the 13th and 14th seasons (as he was one of the main cast members of ''Nashville''), he eventually returned as a fourth seater in season 15.\n\n===Other comedy work===\nFollowing his return to ''Whose Line Is It Anyway'', Esten made a guest appearance as himself with fellow regular cast members from the show [[Wayne Brady]], [[Greg Proops]] and [[Brad Sherwood]] on ''[[The Drew Carey Show]]''.
