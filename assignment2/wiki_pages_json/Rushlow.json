Its members were [[Tim Rushlow]] (lead vocals), Doni Harris ([[banjo]], acoustic guitar, vocals), Kurt Allison (acoustic guitar, electric guitar, vocals), Tully Kennedy (bass guitar, vocals), Rich Redmond (drums), and Billy Welch (keyboards). Prior to the band's foundation, Rushlow was lead singer of [[Little Texas (band)|Little Texas]] until 1997, and a solo artist between then and 2001.\n\nSigned to [[Lyric Street Records]] in 2003, Rushlow released two singles and one album (''[[Right Now (Rushlow album)|Right Now]]'') on the label that year. Rushlow and Harris later recorded as the duo Rushlow Harris for the [[Show Dog Nashville]] label in 2006. After disbanding, Kennedy, Allison, and Redmond became members of [[Jason Aldean]]'s road band; they, along with [[David Fanning (singer)|David Fanning]], also founded the [[record producer]] team [[New Voice Entertainment]].\n\n==Biography==\nBefore the foundation of Rushlow, lead vocalist [[Tim Rushlow]] was lead singer of the band [[Little Texas (band)|Little Texas]]. In 1997, when they disbanded, Tim Rushlow left for a solo career. His first cut was the musical track \"Totally Committed\" on comedian [[Jeff Foxworthy]]'s 1998 [[Totally Committed|album of the same name]]. Tim Rushlow signed to [[Atlantic Records]] in 2000, charting the Top Ten single \"She Misses Him\" that year. Other singles from his [[Tim Rushlow (album)|self-titled debut album]], however, failed to make Top 40, due in part to the closure of his label in 2001.<ref name=\"cmt\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/1484472/with-a-new-album-rushlows-ready-to-rock/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402165456/http://www.cmt.com/news/1484472/with-a-new-album-rushlows-ready-to-rock/|url-status=dead|archive-date=April 2, 2015|title=With a New Album, Rushlow's Ready to Rock|first=Edward|last=Morris|website=Cmt.com|accessdate=2020-03-25}}</ref> He formed the group Rushlow after deciding that he was not made for a solo career, saying: \"I did some shows and I had a band and a bus, but I never felt real comfortable as the Tim Rushlow solo guy with this band that was not named, that was just sort of 'Tim's backup band.' It just never really felt right.\"<ref name=\"cmt\"/>\n\nOne of the group's first members was Rushlow's cousin Doni Harris, who had previously sung backing vocals on his solo album. Later, Rushlow and Harris had spotted Kurt Allison, as well as Allison's roommates Rich Redmond and Tully Kennedy, all of whom were backing another singer at a bar, and eventually Billy Welch was added to the lineup as well.<ref name=\"cmt\"/><ref name=\"pdf\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.wmeagency.com/|title=WME|website=Wmeagency.com|accessdate=2020-03-25}}</ref> The group was signed to [[Lyric Street Records]], on the condition that they assume the name Rushlow and perform as a self-contained band, with no additional studio musicians.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://angrycountry.com/?story=20050315163719718|title=Angry Country|website=Angrycountry.com|accessdate=2020-03-25}}</ref> The lead-off single, \"I Can't Be Your Friend\", was a Top 20 country hit in 2003, and the group also entertained U.S. troops in [[Bahrain]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]] and [[Spain]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1481024/20031209/rushlow.jhtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930044213/http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1481024/20031209/rushlow.jhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 30, 2007|website=CMT.com |title=Rushlow : Rushlow Band Unveils Debut Album|accessdate=2020-03-25}}</ref> The song served as the lead-off to Rushlow's debut album ''[[Right Now (Rushlow album)|Right Now]]'', which produced only one more chart single on the country charts.\n\n===2006–2007: Rushlow Harris===\nIn 2006, Rushlow and Harris recorded as '''Rushlow Harris'''.
