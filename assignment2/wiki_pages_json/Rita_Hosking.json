Her father worked the night shift at a sawmill as part of the area's logging industry. Her great-grandfather, from [[Cornwall]], southwest of England, was an underground coal miner in the region. Her grandmother's family had headed there in a covered wagon on the Oregon Trail, from Virginia.\n\nHosking says old-time music was strong in her mountain area, as well as country. She grew up hearing neighbors play their simple instruments by ear, as a group called the Mountaineers. And the school cook took several girls from the school, taught them songs and they performed as the Farmerettes; with the Farmerettes, Hosking played washboard and sang her first solo.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.californiachronicle.com/articles/yb/146046838 |title=Article by Patrick S.
