He achieved success at an early age, winning the [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year]] at the age of 21. During his career, he established himself as one of America's most successful and honored songwriter/composers.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Miller |first1=Jay N. |title='Highwayman': Grammy winner Jimmy Webb comes to City Winery and Narrows Center |url=https://www.patriotledger.com/story/entertainment/2023/04/05/grammy-winner-jimmy-webb-comes-to-city-winery-and-narrows-center/70081742007/ |website=Patriot Ledger |publisher=The Patriot Ledger |access-date=June 12, 2023}}</ref> \n\nWebb has written numerous [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]]-selling songs, including \"[[Up, Up and Away (song)|Up, Up and Away]]\", \"[[By the Time I Get to Phoenix]]\", \"[[MacArthur Park (song)|MacArthur Park]]\", \"[[Wichita Lineman]]\", \"[[Worst That Could Happen]]\", \"[[Galveston (song)|Galveston]]\" and \"[[All I Know]]\".<ref name=\"allmusic-bio\"/> He had successful collaborations with [[Glen Campbell]], [[Michael Feinstein]], [[Linda Ronstadt]], [[the 5th Dimension]], [[the Supremes]], [[Art Garfunkel]] and [[Richard Harris]].<ref name=\"discogs-writing\"/>\n\nWebb was inducted into the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 1986 and the [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 1990. He received the [[National Academy of Songwriters]] Lifetime Achievement Award in 1993, the Songwriters Hall of Fame Johnny Mercer Award in 2003, the ASCAP \"Voice of Music\" Award in 2006 and the [[Ivor Novello Awards|Ivor Novello Special International Award]] in 2012. According to [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]], his song \"By the Time I Get to Phoenix\" was the third most performed song in the 50 years between 1940 and 1990.<ref name=\"songwriters-bio\"/> Webb is the only artist ever to receive [[Grammy Award]]s for music, lyrics and orchestration.<ref name=\"songwriters-bio\"/>\n\n==Early life==\nWebb was born on August 15, 1946, in [[Elk City, Oklahoma]], and raised in [[Laverne, Oklahoma]]. He grew up in a religiously conservative family;<ref name=\"ohs\"/> His father, Robert Lee Webb, was a [[Baptist]] minister and veteran of the [[United States Marine Corps]] who presided over rural churches in southwestern Oklahoma and west Texas. With his mother's encouragement, Webb learned piano and organ and by the age of 12 was playing in the choir of his father's churches, accompanied by his father on guitar and his mother on accordion.<ref name=\"allmusic-bio\"/>  His father restricted radio listening to country music and white gospel.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bourgoin |first1=Suzanne |title=Contemporary Musicians: Profiles of the People in Music |date=1994 |publisher=Gale Research, Incorporated |isbn=978-0-8103-8553-5 |page=270 |language=en |quote=My father always controlled the radio very empirically and it was always either country music or white gospel ...}}</ref>\n\nDuring the late 1950s, Webb began applying his creativity to the music he was playing at his father's church, frequently improvising and rearranging the hymns.<ref name=\"allmusic-bio\"/> He began to write religious songs at this time,<ref name=\"allmusic-bio\"/> but his musical direction was soon influenced by the new music being played on the radio, including the music of [[Elvis Presley]]. In 1961, at the age of 14, he bought his first record, \"[[Turn Around, Look at Me]]\", by Glen Campbell. Webb said he was drawn to the singer's distinctive voice and they became friends a few years later.<ref name=\"shane\"/>\n\nIn 1964, Webb and his family moved to Southern California, where he attended [[San Bernardino Valley College]], studying music. During this time, he lived in [[Colton, California|Colton]], with his family. Following the death of his mother, Sylvia, in 1964, his father made plans to return to Oklahoma. Webb decided to stay in California to continue his music studies and to pursue a career as a songwriter in Los Angeles. He would later recall his father warning him about his musical aspirations, saying that \"This songwriting thing is going to break your heart.\" Seeing that his son was determined, however, he gave him $40, saying \"It's not much, but it's all I have.\"<ref name=\"shane\"/>\n\n==Career==\n===Early success, 1965–1969===\nAfter transcribing other people's music for a small music publisher in Hollywood, Webb was signed to a songwriting contract with Jobete Music, the publishing arm of [[Motown Records]]. The first commercial recording of a Jimmy Webb song was \"My Christmas Tree\" by [[The Supremes]], which appeared on their 1965 ''[[Merry Christmas (Supremes album)|Merry Christmas]]'' album. The following year, Webb met singer and producer [[Johnny Rivers]], who signed him to a publishing deal and recorded his song \"[[By the Time I Get to Phoenix]]\" on his 1966 album ''Changes''.<ref name=\"unofficial\"/> \n\nIn 1967, Rivers released ''Rewind'', an album featuring seven Webb songs, including \"[[Do What You Gotta Do (Jimmy Webb song)|Do What You Gotta Do]]\" and \"Tunesmith\", a song also recorded that year by [[Vikki Carr]] for her album ''It Must Be Him''.<ref name=\"unofficial\"/> That same year, Rivers turned to Webb for material for a new group Rivers was producing called [[the 5th Dimension]]. Webb contributed five songs to their debut album, ''[[Up, Up and Away (The 5th Dimension album)|Up, Up and Away]]'', including the title track, which was released as a single in May 1967 and reached the Top Ten. The group's follow-up album, ''[[The Magic Garden]]'', was also released in 1967 and featured eleven additional Webb songs, including \"[[Worst That Could Happen]]\".<ref name=\"unofficial\"/>\n\nIn November 1967, Glen Campbell released his version of \"By the Time I Get to Phoenix\", which reached number 26. At the 1968 [[Grammy Awards]], \"Up, Up and Away\" was named Record of the Year (1967) and Song of the Year (1967). \"Up, Up and Away\" and \"By the Time I Get to Phoenix\" received eight Grammy Awards between them. \n\nIn 1968, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' acknowledged Webb's range, proficiency, and \"gift for strong, varied rhythms, inventive structures, and rich, sometimes surprising harmonies\".<ref name=\"songwriters-bio\"/> That year, the string of successful Webb songs continued with the 5th Dimension's \"Paper Cup\" and \"Carpet Man\" reaching the Top 40, Glen Campbell's \"[[Wichita Lineman]]\" selling over a million copies, and [[Johnny Maestro & the Brooklyn Bridge]] scoring a gold record with \"Worst That Could Happen\", a song originally recorded by the 5th Dimension. \n\nWebb formed his own production and publishing company that year, Canopy, and scored a hit with its first project, an unlikely album with Irish actor [[Richard Harris]] singing an album of all Webb songs. One of the songs, \"[[MacArthur Park (song)|MacArthur Park]]\", was a long, complex piece with multiple movements<ref name=\"auto2\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/nov/11/how-we-made-macarthur-park|title=How we made MacArthur Park|date=November 11, 2013|website=the Guardian}}</ref> that was originally rejected by the group [[the Association]]. Despite the song's seven minutes and twenty-one seconds length, Harris's version reached No. 2 on the Hot 100 on June 22, 1968, and No. 4 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] on July 24.<ref>{{cite web |title=Official Singles Chart Top 50: 24 July 1968 |url=https://www.officialcharts.com/charts/singles-chart/19680724/7501/ |website=Official Charts Company |access-date=July 21, 2022}}</ref> The album, ''[[A Tramp Shining]]'', stayed on the charts for almost a year. Webb and Harris produced a follow-up album, ''[[The Yard Went On Forever]]'', which was also successful.  \n\nFurther raising Webb's stature as a songwriter, \"By the Time I Get to Phoenix\" was performed by [[Frank Sinatra]] on the latter's 1968 album ''[[Cycles (Frank Sinatra album)|Cycles]]''. Sinatra would go on to praise \"By the Time I Get to Phoenix\" as \"the greatest [[torch song]] ever written\".<ref>{{cite news |title=The Man Behind The Hits|newspaper=[[Philadelphia Daily News]]|date=January 17, 1992|url=http://articles.philly.com/1992-01-17/news/26036803_1_jimmy-webb-wichita-lineman-song|last=Takiff|first=Jonathan}}</ref> \n\nAt the 1969 [[Grammy Awards]], Webb accepted awards for \"By the Time I Get to Phoenix\", \"Wichita Lineman\", and \"MacArthur Park\". In 2019 \"Wichita Lineman\" was added to the [[National Recording Registry]].<ref name=\"recording-registry\">{{cite web |title=National Recording Registry |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-recording-preservation-board/recording-registry/registry-by-induction-years/2019/ |website=National Recording Registry for 2019 |publisher=Library of Congress |access-date=April 8, 2020 |ref=recording-registry}}</ref>\n\nIn 1969, Glen Campbell continued the streak of Webb hits with the gold record \"Galveston\" and \"[[Where's the Playground Susie]]\". Webb and Campbell had first met during the production of a [[General Motors]] commercial. Webb arrived at the recording session with his [[The Beatles|Beatle]]-length hair and approached the conservative singer, who looked up from his guitar and said, \"Get a haircut.\"<ref name=\"shane\"/> That same year, two Webb songs became hits for the second time with [[Isaac Hayes]]' soulful version of \"By the Time I Get to Phoenix\" and [[Waylon Jennings]]' Grammy-winning country version of \"MacArthur Park\". On Frank Sinatra's 1969 album ''[[My Way (Frank Sinatra album)|My Way]]'', the singer dove deeper into Webb's songbook with a version of \"Didn't We?\", a number that was originally done by Richard Harris in 1968 and released as the B-side of \"MacArthur Park\". Webb finished the year by writing, arranging, and producing [[Thelma Houston]]'s first album, ''[[Sunshower (Thelma Houston album)|Sunshower]]''.<ref name=\"unofficial\"/> \n\nAs the decade came to a close, so too did Webb's string of hit singles. He began to withdraw from the formulaic process in which he worked and began to experiment with his music. He started work on a semi-autobiographical [[Broadway musical]] called ''His Own Dark City'', which reflected the emotional displacement he felt at the time. He also wrote music for the films ''[[How Sweet It Is!]]'' and ''[[Tell Them Willie Boy Is Here]]''.{{cn|date=December 2022}}\n\n===Singer-songwriter years, 1970–1982===\nWebb's career as a singer-songwriter got off to a rough start with the \"counterfeit\" album ''[[Jim Webb Sings Jim Webb]]'', released by Epic Records in 1968. According to Webb, the album was produced \"by a bunch of ruffians from some old demos of mine and tarted up to sound like 'MacArthur Park'\".<ref name=\"uncut-interview\"/> Beginning in 1970, Webb released six original albums of his own songs: ''[[Words and Music (Jimmy Webb album)|Words and Music]]'' (1970), ''[[And So: On]]'' (1971), ''[[Letters (Jimmy Webb album)|Letters]]'' (1972), ''[[Land's End (album)|Land's End]]'' (1974), ''[[El Mirage (album)|El Mirage]]'' (1977), and ''[[Angel Heart (Jimmy Webb album)|Angel Heart]]'' (1982). Despite the critical reception that followed each of these projects, Webb has never been as successful as a performer as he has been as a songwriter and arranger. Each album was noted for its inventive music and memorable lyrics.<ref name=\"shane\"/>\n\nWebb's debut album as a performer, ''[[Words and Music (Jimmy Webb album)|Words and Music]]'', was released on Reprise Records in late 1970 to critical acclaim. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' writer Jon Landau called one of the album's cuts, \"[[P.F. Sloan (song)|P.F. Sloan]]\", a \"masterpiece [that] could not be improved upon\". The album also features the ambitious song trilogy \"Music for an Unmade Movie\". Webb's 1971 follow-up album, ''[[And So: On]]'', proved equally appealing to critics. ''Rolling Stone'' declared the album \"another impressive step in the conspiracy to recover his identity from the housewives of America and rightfully install him at the forefront of contemporary composers/performers.\" The album features the songs \"Met Her on a Plane\", \"All My Love's Laughter\", and \"Marionette\".<ref name=\"allmusic-and-so\"/> Also in 1971, [[the Three Degrees]] are featured in the movie ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'' giving a rendition of Webb's song \"Everybody Gets To Go To The Moon\", originally recorded in 1969 by [[Thelma Houston]].\n\nWebb's 1972 album ''[[Letters (Jimmy Webb album)|Letters]]'', which features his own rendition of \"Galveston\", met with similar praise. Music critic Bruce Eder called ''Letters'' the \"most surprising, diverse, and possibly the most satisfying of all of Jimmy Webb's early solo LPs\" and \"arguably the best of Webb's solo albums\".<ref name=\"allmusic-letters\"/> In his review of the album, Peter Reilly of ''[[Stereo Review]]'' wrote, \"Jimmy Webb is the most important pop music figure to emerge since Bob Dylan.\"<ref name=\"shane\"/> The album also features the songs \"Campo de Encino\", an homage to his park-like residence in Encino, California, during the 1970s, \"When Can Brown Begin\", and \"Piano\".<ref name=\"allmusic-letters\"/> \nHe also produced in 1972 album, \"The Supremes Produced And Arranged By Jimmy Webb.\" for [[The Supremes]], featuring Jean Terrell, Mary Wilson and Linda Lawrence. The album sold poorly and did not chart successfully.\n\nIn 1974, Webb released ''[[Land's End (album)|Land's End]]'' on Asylum Records. Unlike his previous albums, which tended to be underproduced, Webb was able to achieve a more heavily produced pop/rock sound on ''Land's End'', which was recorded in England with the help of an all-star session band that included Joni Mitchell, Ringo Starr, and Nigel Olsson.<ref name=\"allmusic-lands\"/> The album contains \"a thematic consistency in that most of its songs were tales of romantic discord\".<ref name=\"allmusic-lands\"/> While Webb continued to improve as a singer, he \"still hadn't found an identity as a solo artist\".<ref name=\"allmusic-lands\"/> The album features the songs \"Ocean in His Eyes\", \"Just This One Time\", and \"Crying in My Sleep\".\n\nIn 1977, Webb released ''[[El Mirage (album)|El Mirage]]'' on Atlantic Records. Produced, arranged, and conducted by [[The Beatles]]' former producer, [[George Martin]], the album was Webb's \"most polished effort yet as a performer\".<ref name=\"allmusic-el\"/> William Ruhlmann observed, \"These were lush tracks full of tasty playing and warm string charts on which Webb's thin tenor was buoyed by numerous background vocalists, the whole an excellent example of the style known as 'West Coast pop'.\"<ref name=\"allmusic-el\"/> The album contains several strong compositions, including \"[[Highwayman (song)|The Highwayman]]\", which would later become a number one country hit for [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Willie Nelson]], [[Johnny Cash]], and [[Kris Kristofferson]], who named their super group [[The Highwaymen (country supergroup)|The Highwaymen]] after the song. Their version of \"The Highwayman\" won a Grammy Award for Best Country Song.<ref name=\"allmusic-el\"/> ''El Mirage'' also features the songs \"If You See Me Getting Smaller I'm Leaving\", a newly arranged version of \"P.F. Sloan\", and \"[[The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress (song)|The Moon is a Harsh Mistress]]\", which had already been recorded by [[Joe Cocker]], [[Glen Campbell]], and [[Judy Collins]].<ref name=\"allmusic-el\"/> Despite the positive critical response to the album, ''El Mirage'' did not succeed in redefining Webb as a performer as he had hoped.<ref name=\"allmusic-el\"/>\n\nWebb's final solo album from this period, ''[[Angel Heart (Jimmy Webb album)|Angel Heart]]'', was released in 1982 on Lorimar Records. Like its predecessor, the album drew upon the talents of top Los Angeles session musicians to produce a classic West Coast pop sound, enhanced by guest vocal harmonies by Gerry Beckley, Michael McDonald, Graham Nash, Kenny Loggins, Daryl Hall, and Stephen Bishop.<ref name=\"allmusic-angel\"/> Unlike his previous solo albums, however, ''Angel Heart'' lacked the quality material usually associated with the composer. Apart from \"Scissors Cut\" and \"In Cars\", which were previously recorded by [[Art Garfunkel]], the album offered few high points, despite its polished production.<ref name=\"allmusic-angel\"/> A decade would pass before Webb released his next solo album.\n\nThroughout the 1970s and into the 1980s, Webb's songs continued to be recorded by some of the industry's most successful artists. In 1972, Jimmy Webb produced [[The Supremes]]' last album featuring Jean Terrell as lead singer, ''[[The Supremes Produced and Arranged by Jimmy Webb]]''. Webb is quoted as saying he had a crush on [[Mary Wilson (singer)|Mary Wilson]] when he wrote and produced \"I Keep It Hid\" featuring her on lead vocals. In 1977, the initial release of [[Art Garfunkel]]'s ''[[Watermark (Art Garfunkel album)|Watermark]]'' album consisted exclusively of songs by Webb. In 1978, [[Donna Summer]]'s disco version of \"MacArthur Park\" became a multi-million selling vinyl single that was number one on the American pop music charts for three weeks. In 1980, Thelma Houston recorded \"Before There Could Be Me\", \"Breakwater Cat\", \"Gone\", \"Long Lasting Love\", and \"What Was that Song\" on her album ''[[Breakwater Cat]]''. Leah Kunkel recorded \"Never Gonna Lose My Dream of Love Again\" and \"Let's Begin\" for her album ''I Run with Trouble''. The latter was performed live in 1980 by the born-again Bob Dylan. [[Tanya Tucker]] recorded \"Tennessee Woman\" on her album ''[[Dreamlovers (album)|Dreamlovers]]''. And Frank Sinatra did his own cover of \"MacArthur Park\" on the 1980 album ''[[Trilogy: Past Present Future]]''.\n\nIn 1981, Art Garfunkel recorded \"Scissors Cut\", \"In Cars\", and \"That's All I've Got to Say\" for his album ''[[Scissors Cut]]'', and [[Arlo Guthrie]] recorded \"Oklahoma Nights\" on his album ''Power of Love''. In 1982, [[Linda Ronstadt]] recorded \"The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress\" and \"Easy for You to Say\" on her album ''[[Get Closer (Linda Ronstadt album)|Get Closer]]''. That same year, [[Joe Cocker]] recorded \"Just Like Always\" on his album ''[[Sheffield Steel]]'', and [[the Everly Brothers]] recorded \"She Never Smiles Anymore\" on their album ''Living Legends''.\n\nIn 1981 Webb moved to New York state, and said, \"One day I wondered what happened to the Seventies and all those grandiose schemes.\"<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/interview-jimmy-webb-230726/|title=Interview: Jimmy Webb|first1=Stephen|last1=Holden|website=Rollingstone.com|date=April 29, 1982|access-date=August 7, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Large-scale projects, 1982–1992===\nFrom 1982 to 1992, Webb turned his focus from solo performing to large-scale projects, such as [[film scores]], Broadway musicals, and [[classical music]]. In 1982, he produced the soundtrack for the film ''[[The Last Unicorn (film)|The Last Unicorn]]'', an animated children's tale, with the musical group [[America (band)|America]] performing five new Jimmy Webb songs: \"The Last Unicorn\", \"Man's Road\", \"In the Sea\", \"Now That I'm a Woman\", and \"That's All I've Got to Say\". The rest of the album contains instrumental music composed, arranged, and conducted by Webb. That same year, he composed the soundtrack to all episodes of the TV series ''[[Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (TV series)|Seven Brides for Seven Brothers]]''.\n\nThe theme music for the 1984-85 TV sitcom ''[[E/R]]'' was written by Webb. Then in 1985, Glen Campbell recorded Webb's \"Cowboy Hall of Fame\" and \"Shattered\" for the album ''It's Just a Matter of Time''. And heavyweights [[Johnny Cash]], [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Willie Nelson]], and [[Kris Kristofferson]] recorded \"[[Highwayman (song)|Highwayman]]\" on the album ''Highwayman''. In 1988, [[Toto (band)|Toto]] recorded \"Home of the Brave\" on the album ''[[The Seventh One]]''. [[Kenny Rankin]] recorded \"She Moves, Eyes Follow\" for the album ''Hiding in Myself''. And in 1989, Linda Ronstadt recorded the album ''[[Cry Like a Rainstorm, Howl Like the Wind]]'', which featured four Jimmy Webb songs: \"Still Within the Sound of My Voice\" (with Webb playing piano), \"Adios\" (with orchestral arrangement by Webb), \"I Keep It Hid\" (with Webb playing piano), and \"Shattered\". In 1990, [[John Denver]] recorded \"Postcard from Paris\" on the album ''[[The Flower That Shattered the Stone (album)|The Flower That Shattered the Stone]]''. In 1991, [[Kenny Rogers]] recorded \"They Just Don't Make Em Like You Anymore\" on the album ''[[Back Home Again (Kenny Rogers album)|Back Home Again]]''.\n\nIn 1986, Webb produced a [[cantata]], ''The Animals' Christmas'', with Art Garfunkel, [[Amy Grant]], and the [[London Symphony Orchestra]]. The cantata tells the [[Nativity of Jesus|Christmas story]] from the perspective of animals.\n\nIn 1987, Webb produced the soundtrack for the film ''[[The Hanoi Hilton (film)|The Hanoi Hilton]]''. That same year, he reunited with Campbell for the album ''Still Within the Sound of My Voice'', for which he wrote the title song. They followed this up in 1988 with an album composed almost entirely of Jimmy Webb songs, ''Light Years''. The album included the title song, as well as  \"Lightning in a Bottle\", \"If These Walls Could Speak\" (which was also recorded by Amy Grant that year) and \"Our Movie\". Two songs from 1982's ''Seven Brides for Seven Brothers'' also appear on the album. The record also included the songs \"Other People's Lives\", \"Wasn't There A Moment\", \"I Don't Know How To Love You Anymore\", and \"Is There Love After You\". Several of these songs later ended up on Webb solo albums.\n\nIn 1992, Webb completed a musical called ''Instant Intimacy'', which he developed with the [[Nashville Repertory Theatre|Tennessee Repertory Theatre]]. The musical contained new songs that he and others would later record, including \"What Does a Woman See in a Man\", \"I Don't Know How to Love You Anymore\", and \"Is There Love After You\". That same year, Webb performed live at the club Cinegrill, performing \"What Does a Woman See in a Man\" and introducing several additional new songs, including \"Sandy Cove\" and an old folk hymn, \"I Will Arise\".\n\n===Solo artist, 1993–present===\nSince 1993, Webb has produced five critically acclaimed solo albums: ''[[Suspending Disbelief]]'' (1993), ''[[Ten Easy Pieces]]'' (1996), ''[[Twilight of the Renegades]]'' (2005), ''[[Just Across the River]]'' (2010), and ''[[Still Within the Sound of My Voice (Jimmy Webb album)|Still Within the Sound of My Voice]]'' (2013). He has continued to expand his creative landscape to include [[musical theatre|musicals]], [[advertising|commercial]] [[jingle]]s, and [[film score]]s.\n\nIn 1994, Webb teamed with [[Nanci Griffith]] to contribute the song \"If These Old Walls Could Speak\" to the [[AIDS]] benefit album ''[[Red Hot + Country]]'' produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]].\n\nIn 1997, Webb co-produced [[Carly Simon]]'s ''[[Film Noir (album)|Film Noir]]'' album and contributed his vocals, orchestration, and piano skills to the project, which was filmed for an AMC documentary (which premiered in September 1997). He also co-wrote the song \"Film Noir\" with Simon and reprised his role as arranger and co-producer on Simon's 2008 album, ''[[This Kind of Love]]''.\n\nIn 1998, Webb completed his first book, ''Tunesmith: Inside the Art of Songwriting'', which was published by [[Hachette Books|Hyperion Books]]. It was well-received by songwriters and performers and became a best-seller.<ref>{{cite book|last=Webb|first=Jimmy|title=Tunesmith: Inside the Art of Songwriting|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eH4WOv8aTYQC|access-date=October 29, 2011|isbn=9780786884889|date=September 22, 1999|publisher=Hyperion }}</ref> One book reviewer described it as \"a companion every serious songwriter should read, and read again, and keep handy for referral\".<ref name=\"connection\"/>\n \nIn 2007, he released a live album of his show ''[[Live and at Large]]'', which was recorded in the United Kingdom. The album included personal stories and anecdotes about [[Richard Harris]], [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Harry Nilsson]], [[Glen Campbell]], [[Art Garfunkel]], [[Frank Sinatra]], and [[Rosemary Clooney]].\n\nWebb appears in the 2008 documentary ''[[The Wrecking Crew (2008 film)|The Wrecking Crew]]'' providing thoughtful and descriptive insights into the world of California session musicians in the 1960s.\n\nIn June 2010, Webb released ''[[Just Across the River]]'', an album of newly arranged Webb songs that featured guest appearances by [[Vince Gill]], [[Billy Joel]], [[Willie Nelson]], [[Lucinda Williams]], [[Jackson Browne]], [[Glen Campbell]], [[Michael McDonald (singer)|Michael McDonald]], [[Mark Knopfler]], [[JD Souther]], and [[Linda Ronstadt]].\n\nIn 2011, Webb was unanimously elected chairman of the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]], replacing [[Hal David]] who retired after ten years in the position.<ref name=\"songhall\"/>\n\nIn May 2012, Webb traveled to London to receive the [[Ivor Novello Awards|Ivor Novello Special International Award]], which recognizes non-British writers and composers who have made an extraordinary contribution to the global musical landscape.<ref name=\"ivors\"/> In September 2012, Fantasy Records released ''[[Glen Campbell and Jimmy Webb: In Session]]'', a collaborative album by Campbell and Webb. The album and its accompanying DVD were filmed and recorded in December 1988 at the Hamilton, Ontario, studios of [[CHCH-TV]] as part of the Canadian concert series ''In Session''.<ref name=\"allmusic-in-session\"/>\n\nDecades after he sold his first song, Webb's influence on his fellow musicians is ongoing. Rock singer-songwriter [[Bruce Springsteen]] has acknowledged that his 2019 album ''[[Western Stars]]'' was profoundly impacted by Webb's music,<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2016/09/bruce-springsteen-cover-story|title=Cover Story: The Book of Bruce Springsteen|first=David|last=Kamp|date=September 6, 2016|magazine=Vanity Fair}}</ref> and country music singer [[Keith Urban]] cites Webb as his earliest songwriting inspiration.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/country/7604502/dan-rather-keith-urban-the-big-interview|title=Dan Rather to Sit Down With Keith Urban on 'The Big Interview'|first=Chuck|last=Dauphin|date=December 8, 2016|website=Billboard Magazine}}</ref>\n\nWebb continues to perform throughout the United States and abroad.<ref name=\"jw-performances\"/> In 2017 he published an autobiography, ''The Cake and the Rain: A Memoir''.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Cake and the Rain: A Memoir|first=Jimmy|last=Webb|date=April 18, 2017|publisher=St. Martin's Press|id={{ASIN|1250058414|country=uk}}}}</ref>\n\nIn 2024, Webb's song \"[[MacArthur Park (song)|MacArthur Park]]\" by both [[Donna Summer]] and [[Richard Harris]] was included in the [[Beetlejuice Beetlejuice (soundtrack)|''Beetlejuice Beetlejuice'' soundtrack]].\n\n==Emotional content of songs==\nWhile some of Webb's songs are happy, such as \"Up, Up and Away\", he has said that \"The territory I tend to inhabit is that sort of 'crushed lonely hearts' thing.
