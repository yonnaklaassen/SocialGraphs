Between 1991 and 1993, Mowrey recorded two studio albums, both on major labels: 1991's ''Honky Tonk'' on [[Capitol Records]] Nashville, and 1993's ''Dude Mowrey'' on [[Arista Nashville]]. These albums produced four singles for Mowrey on the [[Hot Country Songs]] charts. The first of these, \"Cowboys Don't Cry\", was later a Top 40 hit when [[Daron Norwood]] recorded it for his debut album three years after Mowrey's version. Another cut, \"Fallin' Never Felt So Good\", was later recorded by both [[Shawn Camp (musician)|Shawn Camp]] and [[Mark Chesnutt]].\n\nCountry singer [[Mel Tillis]] discovered Mowrey in the mid-1980s while Mowrey was still in his mid-teens;<ref name=\"oldies\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.artsforthearts.org/dudemowrey.htm |title=May 12 featured guests |accessdate=May 24, 2008 |work=Arts for the Arts |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20070616125033/http://www.artsforthearts.org/dudemowrey.htm |archivedate=June 16, 2007 }}</ref> Tillis also served as Mowrey's manager, and helped the singer sign to Capitol in 1991.<ref>{{cite news |title=Dude Mowrey slated for appearance on TNN |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=NewsLibrary&p_multi=OSBB&d_place=OSBB&p_theme=newslibrary2&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=1033C71DEE9C8519&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM |work=Ocala Star-Banner |date=March 24, 1993 |accessdate=May 24, 2008}}</ref> Mowrey's debut album, ''Honky Tonk'', was released in 1991. Included on it was the single \"Cowboys Don't Cry\", as well as \"Honky Tonk Song\", a song which Tillis initially wrote for [[Webb Pierce]]. By 1993, Mowrey had transferred to Arista Nashville, releasing a self-titled album that year, as well as three more singles. Arista label mate Lee Roy Parnell made a guest appearance in Mowrey's music video for the song \"Hold on Elroy\" which was filmed at an old cabin just outside Nashville, TN.\n\n==Discography==\n\n===''Honky Tonk'' (1991)===\n{{Infobox album\n| italic_title = no\n| name         = Honky Tonk\n| type         = studio\n| artist       = Dude Mowrey\n| cover        = Dude_Mowrey_-_Honky_Tonk.jpg\n| alt          =\n| released     = {{Start date|1991|04|15}}\n| recorded     =\n| venue        =\n| studio       = Sound Stage Studios, [[Nashville TN]]\n| genre        = Country\n| length       = 29:30\n| label        = Capitol Nashville No.&nbsp;95085\n| producer     = [[Jimmy Bowen]], Dude Mowrey\n| prev_title   =\n| prev_year    =\n| next_title   =\n| next_year    =\n}}\n\n====Track listing====\n#\"Honky Tonk Song\" ([[Mel Tillis]], Buck Peddy) – 1:57\n#\"It Could've Been Me\" (Curt Ryle, Johnny Park) – 3:38\n#\"[[Cowboys Don't Cry]]\" (Jim Allison, Bob Simon, Doug Gilmore, Jeff Raymond) – 2:34\n#\"Heartbreak Train\" ([[Roger Murrah]], J.D.
