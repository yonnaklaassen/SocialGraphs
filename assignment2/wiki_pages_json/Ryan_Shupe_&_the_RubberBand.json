The second single from the album, however, failed to chart, and the band was dropped from Capitol.  In 2008, the band signed to [[Montage Music Group]] and released the album [[Last Man Standing (Ryan Shupe & The RubberBand album)|Last Man Standing]].  After this, the band continued to tour nationally and promote their unique brand of music.  In 2010, the band released the album \"Brand New Shoes\" on their own independent label.  This album has many crowd favorites and highlights the cross-genre, acousti-jam sound they have become known for.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ryanshupe.com/brand-new-shoes |title=Official Ryan Shupe & The Rubberband Lyrics, Tickets and More!
