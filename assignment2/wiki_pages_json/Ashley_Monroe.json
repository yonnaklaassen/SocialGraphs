Her parents played songs by the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]] and [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]]. After her father died from cancer when she was 13, Monroe started to write songs to help her deal with the loss, several of which appear on her fourth album, ''[[Sparrow (Ashley Monroe album)|Sparrow]]''. A few years later, she began to perform in small clubs in Nashville.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/ashley-monroe/biography/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130105085250/http://www.cmt.com/artists/ashley-monroe/biography/|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 5, 2013|title=Ashley Monroe Bio - Ashley Monroe Career|work=CMT Artists}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===''Satisfied''===\nAfter a year in Nashville, she gained a publishing deal as a songwriter, which then led to her signing to a record contract with [[Sony Records]] under John Grady, where she began to record her debut album, ''[[Satisfied (Ashley Monroe album)|Satisfied]]''. In 2006, the title track to the album was released as the first single to country radio. It failed to make the top 40 on the [[Hot Country Songs]] chart, however, a second single was released shortly after. \"I Don't Want To\" was released as the second single, which featured [[Ronnie Dunn]] of [[Brooks & Dunn]]. It initially did well on the charts, charting at No.&nbsp;37.\n\nStill after two singles, the album hadn't been released. The label then decided not to release the album until Monroe charted a top 20 single. But, no follow-up singles were ever released. iTunes briefly had the album available in July 2006 but it was removed from the online store by mid-August.\n\nIn late 2007, Monroe and Columbia Records parted ways, and ''Satisfied'' went without being released. In addition to her own material, she co-wrote [[Katrina Elam]]'s 2007 single \"Flat on the Floor\" (which was also recorded by [[Carrie Underwood]] on her 2007 album ''[[Carnival Ride]]''), as well as [[Jason Aldean]]'s 2009 single, \"[[The Truth (Trent Willmon song)|The Truth]]\", and [[Miranda Lambert]]'s 2011 single, \"[[Heart Like Mine]].\"\n\nIn April 2009, it was announced on Monroe's MySpace page that ''Satisfied'' would be released to digital retailers ([[iTunes]], [[Rhapsody (online music service)|Rhapsody]], etc.) on May 19, 2009. The single \"I Don't Want To\" was not included.\n\nIn early 2012 Amazon.com and Spotify began streaming and selling an MP3 track called \"Promised Land\" that was originally recorded for, but left off of, the \"Satisfied\" album and now is listed as a Bonus Track.\n\n===''Ashley Monroe EP''===\nIn late 2009 Monroe posted on her MySpace page that she was independently releasing a new self-titled EP. It would only be sold at the live shows. While she was touring with the Ten out of Tenn artists she realized she had nothing to sell to the fans who loved her sets and she wanted to give them something. This EP contains the tracks \"Has Anybody Ever Told You\", \"Angeline\", \"Drink for Two\", \"And You\" along with Trent Dabbs collaboration \"Everything I Wanted\".\n\n===''Like a Rose''===\nAshley Monroe received a record deal with [[Warner Bros. Records|Warner Bros. Nashville]] and released her second studio album, ''[[Like a Rose (album)|Like a Rose]]'' on March 5, 2013. The album, produced by [[Vince Gill]], was met with widespread critical acclaim. It features nine tracks co-written by the singer, one of which is a collaboration with [[Blake Shelton]].<ref name=\"Boot\">{{cite web|url=http://www.theboot.com/2013/03/05/ashley-monroe-like-a-rose-album-interview/ |title=Ashley Monroe, 'Like a Rose' Album Is Thorns-and-All Approach to Country Music (Exclusive Interview)|author=Stephen L.
