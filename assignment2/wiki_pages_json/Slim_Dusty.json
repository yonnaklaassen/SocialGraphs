In 1954, the two launched a full-time business career, including the Slim Dusty Travelling Show. McKean was Dusty's wife and manager for over 50 years. \n\nMcKean's sister Heather, half of the McKean Sisters music duo that preceded Joy's association with Dusty, was married to Australian country singer [[Reg Lindsay]], before separating and later divorcing in the 1980s, whereupon the McKean sisters re-started their music duo.\n\nTogether Dusty and Joy McKean had two children, [[Anne Kirkpatrick]] and David Kirkpatrick, who are also accomplished singer-songwriters.<ref name=\"slimdusty.com.au\">{{cite web |url=http://www.slimdusty.com.au/news.html#joytributeconcert |title=News |publisher=Slim Dusty |access-date=10 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120430142753/http://www.slimdusty.com.au/news.html#joytributeconcert |archive-date=30 April 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Dusty hits written by Joy McKean===\nMcKean wrote several of Dusty's most popular songs, including \"[[Lights On The Hill]]\", \"Walk a Country Mile\", \"Indian Pacific\", \"Kelly's Offsider\", \"The Angel of Goulburn Hill\" and \"[[The Biggest Disappointment]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://store.countrymusic.com.au/store/item.inetstore?id=343 |title=The Country Music Store – Slim Dusty Sings Joy McKean |publisher=Store.countrymusic.com.au |access-date=10 April 2012 |archive-date=30 August 2002 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020830034755/http://store.countrymusic.com.au/store/item.inetstore?id=343 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Other songwriters' contributions===\nAlthough himself an accomplished writer of songs, Dusty had a number of other songwriters, including Mack Cormack, [[Gordon Parsons (singer-songwriter)|Gordon Parsons]], [[Stan Coster]], and Kelly Dixon, who were typically short on formal education but big on personal experience of the [[Australian bush]]. Drawing on his travels and such writers over a span of decades, Dusty chronicled the story of a rapidly changing postwar Australian nation.\n\n===First megahit===\nDusty's 1957 hit \"[[A Pub with No Beer]]\" was the biggest-selling record by an Australian to that time, the first Australian single to go gold and the first and only 78 rpm record to be awarded a gold disc.<ref name=\"Guardian-obit\">Dave Laing, [https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/sep/20/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries \"Slim Dusty: Country singer famous for A Pub With No Beer\"], ''The Guardian (UK)'', 20 September 2003</ref> (The \"Pub with No Beer\" is a real place, in [[Taylors Arm, New South Wales|Taylors Arm]], not far from Kempsey, where Slim was born.)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mynrma.com.au/cps/rde/xchg/mynrma/hs.xsl/north_coast_pub.htm|title=North Coast: The Pub With No Beer|publisher=[[NRMA]]|access-date=13 June 2008}}</ref> In 1959 and 1960, Dutch and German cover versions of the song became number one hits (even evergreens) in Belgium, Austria and Germany, brought by the Flemish country singer-guitarist and amusement park founder [[Bobbejaan Schoepen]].\nIn 1964 the annual Slim Dusty Australia-round tour, a {{Convert|48280|km|mi|0}} journey that went on for ten months, was started.

An example is \"[[The Man from Snowy River (poem)|The Man from Snowy River]]\" by Paterson. The 1980 album and songs ''The Man Who Steadies the Lead'' and ''The Pearl of Them All'' were the works of Paterson's rival for the title of Australia's bush balladeer, Scottish-Australian poet [[William Henry Ogilvie|Will H.

Around Australia, thousands of fans gathered to stand outside the cathedral; Dusty was later cremated.\n\nDusty had been working on his 106th album for EMI at the time of his death. On 8 March 2004 the album, ''[[Columbia Lane – the Last Sessions]]'', debuted at number five in the Australian album charts and number one on the country charts. Gold status was achieved after being on sale for less than two weeks.\n\n''Columbia Lane'' is a tribute to the laneway juxtaposed to [[Parramatta Road]] in [[Strathfield]] (near the railway bridge link), where the EMI studios once stood (now a [[Kennards Self Storage]] store), and where he began his music career.\n\nIn 2004, Tamworth hosted the \"Concert for Slim\" as a memorial tribute featuring more than 30 Australian musical artists including [[Joy McKean]], [[Paul Kelly (Australian musician)|Paul Kelly]], [[Keith Urban]], [[Lee Kernaghan]] and [[Kasey Chambers]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://chaos.com/product/concert-for-slim-slim-dusty/571478-192588.html |title=Concert for Slim (Slim Dusty): DVDs |publisher=Chaos.com |access-date=10 April 2012 |archive-date=4 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304023057/http://chaos.com/product/concert-for-slim-slim-dusty/571478-192588.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, in tribute to the iconic song \"[[Cunnamulla Fella]]\" performed by Dusty with lyrics by [[Stan Coster]], an eponymous statue was unveiled in the Queensland town of [[Cunnamulla]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.queenslandholidays.com.au/things-to-see-and-do/cunnamulla-fella/index.cfm |title=Cunnamulla Fella – Things To See and Do |publisher=Queensland Holidays |date=18 November 2005 |access-date=10 April 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[EMI Records]]' Australian sales of Dusty's records surpassed seven million in 2007.<ref name=\"sdc\">{{cite web |url=http://www.slimdusty.com.au/milestones.html |title=Milestones |publisher=Slim Dusty |access-date=10 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110920214044/http://www.slimdusty.com.au/milestones.html |archive-date=20 September 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Milestones==\nSlim Dusty was Australia's most successful and prolific musical artist, with more [[Gold album|Gold]] and [[Platinum albums]] than any other Australian artist.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/music/country/ |title=Australian country music – australia.gov.au |publisher=Cultureandrecreation.gov.au |date=31 October 2007 |access-date=10 April 2012 |archive-date=17 February 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110217020802/http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/music/country/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> He was also:<ref name=\"nla.gov.au\"/>\n\n* The first Australian to receive a [[Gold Record]]. \n* Made a [[Member of the Order of the British Empire]] and an [[Officer of the Order of Australia]] for services to entertainment.\n* On 14 April 1981, on [[Space Shuttle Columbia|Space Shuttle ''Columbia'']]'s [[STS-1|first mission]], Dusty's rendition of \"[[Waltzing Matilda]]\" was broadcast to Earth.<ref>[https://www.honeysucklecreek.net/other_stations/orroral/Orroral_STS-1_audio.html STS-1 audio (Orbit 16)]. 14 April 1981.
