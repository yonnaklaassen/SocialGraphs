Music was an important part of the Moorer family. Her father was a local bandleader and her mother a harmony-singing teacher; as children, she and her younger sister [[Allison Moorer|Allison]] — later a country recording artist in her own right — sometimes joined their parents on-stage to sing along. However, Lynne's father was a violent alcoholic who abused his wife. In 1985, her mother fled with the two girls to Mobile. Her father soon discovered their whereabouts. In 1986, when Lynne was 17 and her sister was 14, he fatally shot her mother in the family's driveway. He then turned the gun on himself while his daughters were in the house.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.npr.org/2010/12/15/132082946/shelby-lynne-and-allison-moorer-musical-sisters | title=Shelby Lynne and Allison Moorer: Musical Sisters | publisher=NPR | date=December 15, 2010 | access-date=April 4, 2018 | archive-date=September 20, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170920182902/http://www.npr.org/2010/12/15/132082946/shelby-lynne-and-allison-moorer-musical-sisters | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===Early years===\nLynne appeared on [[The Nashville Network|TNN]]'s country music show ''[[Nashville Now]]'' in 1987. She soon landed a recording contract with [[Epic Records]]. Her first recording for Epic was a duet with [[George Jones]], \"If I Could Bottle This Up\", which became a top-50 hit in 1988.  Epic teamed Lynne with producer [[Billy Sherrill]] for her 1989 debut album ''[[Sunrise (Shelby Lynne album)|Sunrise]]''. The follow-up, 1990's ''[[Tough All Over (Shelby Lynne album)|Tough All Over]]'', took more of a mainstream country direction, and 1991's ''[[Soft Talk]]'' found Lynne moving into slick [[country pop]].\n\nLynne placed several songs on the country charts during this period, but none managed to break into the top 20. Critics generally regarded her as a promising talent, and she won the [[Academy of Country Music Award for New Female Artist of the Year|Academy of Country Music Award for Top New Female Vocalist]] in 1991, beating the other two nominees [[Carlene Carter]] and [[Matraca Berg]].\n\nHowever, she was tiring of the lack of control she was afforded over her image and musical direction. She split from Epic and signed with the smaller [[Morgan Creek Productions|Morgan Creek]] label, debuting with 1993's ''[[Temptation (Shelby Lynne album)|Temptation]]'', an exercise in [[Bob Wills]]-style [[Western swing]] and [[big band]] jazz. The label folded not long after, and she moved on to [[Magnatone]] for 1995's ''[[Restless (Shelby Lynne album)|Restless]]'', which marked a return to contemporary-style country. Afterward, Lynne disappeared from recording for several years.  One notable project that she assisted on was Vince Gill's 1996 ''High Lonesome Sound'' album, where she provided background, harmony vocals on the song \"[[You and You Alone (song)|You And You Alone]]\".\nVince Gill and Shelby Lynne performed the song at the 1997 CMA awards show.\n\n===Breakthrough===\nIn 1998, Lynne moved to [[Palm Springs, California]].<ref>{{cite magazine | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,996707,00.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101122105431/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,996707,00.html | url-status=dead | archive-date=November 22, 2010 | title=Music: Blows Against The Empire | author=Thigpen, David E. | magazine=TIME | date=April 24, 2000}}</ref> For her next record, she worked with producer and songwriter [[Bill Bottrell]].

The album received mixed reviews.\n\nLynne took a more low-key approach on her next effort. ''[[Identity Crisis (Shelby Lynne album)|Identity Crisis]]'' was self-produced, recorded largely in her home studio and with few additional musicians. Many of the 12 tracks focused on dark themes, but there were also lighter songs such as \"One With the Sun\" (inspired by a conversation she had with [[Willie Nelson]]).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://archives.nodepression.com/2003/09/this-years-model/ | title=This year's model | author=McCall, Michael | publisher=No Depression | date=September–October 2003 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120929170603/http://archives.nodepression.com/2003/09/this-years-model/ | archive-date=2012-09-29 }}</ref> The album found a home on Capitol Records and was released in September 2003.

The producer was [[Phil Ramone]], who had worked with Springfield on \"[[The Look of Love (1967 song)|The Look of Love]]\". ''Just A Little Lovin''' became the highest charting album of Lynne's career, reaching number 41 on the ''Billboard'' 200. In a review for ''Entertainment Weekly'', Marc Weingarten wrote that the album \"is a stark reminder of Lynne's empathetic skill as an interpreter\".<ref>{{cite magazine | url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20166944_20166960_20175495,00.html | archive-url=https://archive.today/20130123010011/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20166944_20166960_20175495,00.html | url-status=dead | archive-date=January 23, 2013 | title=Just a Little Lovin' | author=Weingarten, Marc| magazine=Entertainment Weekly | date=February 1, 2008}}</ref> The sparse production and extremely well recorded nature of the album, combined with its song selection have made this album a favorite audiophile \"demo\" recording, and as a result the album was reissued on audiophile-grade 200g vinyl as well as [[Super Audio CD|SACD]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://musicangle.com/feat.php?id=198 | title=\" Just a Little Lovin' \" Finally Gets Some | author=Marc, Andrei | publisher=\"Michael Fremer's Music Angle\" | date=March 1, 2012 | access-date=May 8, 2012 | archive-date=May 9, 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509155225/http://musicangle.com/feat.php?id=198 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nFollowing a dispute with Lost Highway, Lynne started her own label, called Everso Records. \"I plan on taking advantage of my freedom and working hard and putting out a lot of records,\" she said in an interview.<ref>{{cite magazine | url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/958499/shelby-lynne-plots-own-course-with-tears | title=Shelby Lynne Plots Own Course With 'Tears' | author=Graff, Gary | magazine=Billboard.com | date=April 23, 2010}}</ref> The first release was her album ''[[Tears, Lies and Alibis]]'' (2010).

She contributed to ''Forever Cool'', a 2007 album from Capitol/EMI featuring contemporary artists in duets with the late [[Dean Martin]]. Alongside [[Big Bad Voodoo Daddy]], Lynne performed a duet of one of Martin's best-known tunes, \"You're Nobody 'Til Somebody Loves You\".\n\nShe also joined the 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th and, in 2015, the 14th annual Independent Music Awards judging panel, to assist independent musicians' careers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independentmusicawards.com/ima_new/imajudges2010.asp|title=Independent Music Awards - 9th Annual Judges|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001005627/http://www.independentmusicawards.com/ima_new/imajudges2010.asp|archive-date=2011-10-01}}</ref>\n\nLynne has taken on a few acting roles. \"She expressed interest about working in film back in the January 1992 issue of ''Modern Screen's Country Music'' when we spoke for a story I teased on the cover ('Shelby Lynne: Is Hollywood Beckoning?') after her appearance in Willie Nelson's ''Another Pair of Aces'' TV-movie with Kris Kristofferson.
