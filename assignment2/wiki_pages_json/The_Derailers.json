They were founded by [[Portland, Oregon]], natives Tony Villanueva and Brian Hofeldt in 1994.<ref>[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=the derailers|bio=true}} Billboard.com - Biography - Derailers<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe Derailers' first LP, ''Live Tracks'', was issued in 1995. It was the first release of the Austin-based independent label Freedom Records. Shortly after the release, The Derailers became one of the most talked about acts at Austin's 1995 [[South by Southwest]] music festival, and the record became profitable within two months.<ref>[http://weeklywire.com/ww/09-08-98/austin_music_feature7.html Music: Freedom Records (''Austin Chronicle''. 09-08-1998)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> This occurred at a time when “[[Americana (music)|Americana]]” radio stations were starting to multiply and various forms of non-mainstream country music were coming together under such rubrics as Americana and alternative-country. The Derailers became a major part of that movement, representing the \"[[Honky tonk|traditional honky-tonk]]\" end of the subgenre.\n\nWith its fan base growing, the band signed with the more established Austin independent label Watermelon Records for their second release, ''Jackpot'' (1996), and then moved to Sire Records for their third release, ''Reverb Deluxe'' (1997).  Aggressive touring across the U.S. and airplay on Americana radio stations<ref>[http://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/article.asp?xid=391 The Derailers hope to widen the track – September 1999<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> grew a steadily increasing fan base and The Derailers came to be seen as an act poised for breakout success in mainstream country, and were even hailed as “the future of country music” in the Austin press.<ref>[http://www.weeklywire.com/ww/11-17-97/austin_music_feature2_side.html Music: Reverb Deluxe (Austin Chronicle . 11-17-97)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> They signed with [[Curb Records]] for their first major-label release, ''Full Western Dress'', in 1999, which would reach No.&nbsp;69 on the ''Billboard'' Country chart. A single from this album, \"The Right Place\", appeared on the ''Billboard'' single charts at No.&nbsp;71 <ref>[http://www.lpdiscography.com/d/Derailers/derailers.htm LP Discography<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and the video became one of the 50 most requested of the year 2000 on [[Country Music Television]].<ref>[http://blogs.mysanantonio.com/weblogs/goodspeed/archives/2007/09/ MySA.com: Goodspeed's Country<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nSeeking greater mainstream success, The Derailers switched to [[Sony]]’s Lucky Dog Records for their next release, ''Here Come the Derailers'', and were paired with Nashville A-list producer [[Kyle Lehning]].<ref>[http://music.barnesandnoble.com/Here-Come-the-Derailers/Derailers/e/696998579323 Barnes & Noble.com - Music: Here Come the Derailers, Derailers, CD<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> This album had the unfortunate release date of September 11, 2001, and was largely overlooked by mainstream radio stations that began emphasizing patriotic songs.<ref>[http://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/article.asp?xid=389 This time, The Derailers are genuine – March 2003<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> A profile of the band on [[National Public Radio]]’s ''[[Morning Edition]]'' in 2002 did help push the album just into the top 50 on the ''Billboard'' country charts.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.indyweek.com/gyrobase/PrintFriendly?oid=oid%3A17835 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-04-19 |archive-date=2008-09-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080928214926/http://www.indyweek.com/gyrobase/PrintFriendly?oid=oid%3A17835 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The follow-up release for Lucky Dog, ''Genuine'' (2003), did slightly better, cresting at No.&nbsp;44. But soon after that, founding member and primary vocalist Tony Villanueva announced he was leaving the band to spend more time with his family and become a church pastor.<ref>[http://www.pandora.com/music/artist/derailers The Derailers – Pandora Internet Radio<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nSince Villanueva’s departure, The Derailers have shuffled their lineup, with Brian Hofeldt taking on the role of primary front man. With these changes they have moved back to the independent world, releasing two albums on the Palo Duro label, ''Soldiers of Love'' (2007) and ''Under the Influence of Buck'' (2007), a tribute album to one of their heroes, [[Buck Owens]]. While their new music is being once again embraced by Americana stations, it appears that The Derailers may have passed their high water mark in terms of success in the mainstream of country music.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\nBuck Owens and [[the Buckaroos]] has been one of the primary influences on the Derailers' music from the beginning. Owens himself performed with the band on one track of ''Full Western Dress'', \"Play Me the Waltz of the Angels\", and also selected the band to play at his 70th birthday party in 1999.<ref>[http://www.palodurorecords.com/wordpress/index.php/category/music/derailers/ Palo Duro Records » Derailers<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nIn addition to Buck Owens and the Buckaroos, The Derailers' music also reflects influences from 1960s pop-rock acts such as [[The Beatles]], [[Roy Orbison]] and [[The Beach Boys]]. On their 2007 CD, ''Under The Influence Of Buck'', they dedicated the CD to Buck Owens and Buckaroo front men [[Don Rich]] and [[Doyle Holly]].\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
