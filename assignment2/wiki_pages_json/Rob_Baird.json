He released his debut album, ''Blue Eyed Angels'' (Carnival Recording Company),<ref>http://www.carnivalrecordingcompany.com/ {{Dead link|date=March 2022}}</ref> in 2010 and his sophomore effort, ''I Swear It's the Truth'', in May 2012.

During his time at Texas Christian, at the age of 21, he recorded his debut project. The album ''Blue Eyed Angels'' was produced by Scott Davis and featured musicians from [[Hayes Carll]]'s band. That initial effort featured the singles, \"Fade Away\" (a top 5 single on the Texas Music Chart), \"Could Have Been My Baby,\" and the title track.\n\nIn 2012 Baird followed up ''Blue Eyed Angels'' with ''I Swear It's The Truth'', named one of the top twenty albums of the year by [[Spin Magazine]].<ref name=\"121217-19-rob-baird\">{{cite web| url = https://www.spin.com/2012/12/best-country-albums-2012/121217-19-rob-baird/| url-status = dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160326072337/http://www.spin.com/2012/12/best-country-albums-2012/121217-19-rob-baird/| archive-date = 2016-03-26| title = Rob Baird – I Swear It's the Truth (Carnival) SPIN}}</ref>  ''I Swear It's The Truth'' featured the hit single, “Dreams and Gasoline” which was added to [[XM]]’s \"[[The Highway (Sirius XM)|The Highway]]\" and was featured in the ABC drama ''[[Nashville (2012 TV series)|Nashville]]''.

Three of his songs have also been used in season three of [[The CW|CW]]'s ''[[Hart of Dixie]]'' (\"Same Damn Thing\" in episode 10, \"More Than Willing\" in episode 17, and \"40 Days and 40 Nights\" in episode 20).\n\nOver the years, Baird has kept an active touring schedule balancing support slots with [[Jason Isbell]], [[Billy Joe Shaver]], [[The Steeldrivers]], [[Don Williams]], and many others with developing an impressive string of headlining dates in several major markets.\n\nBaird relocated to Austin, Texas in 2015 and recorded his third record, ''Wrong Side of the River,'' released on May, 13th, 2016 on Baird's label Hard Luck Recording Company. Produced by Brian Douglas Phillips, the album presents a stark contrast to some of Baird's previous work. ''Wrong Side of the River'' is laden with the blues of Memphis and the outlaw [[alt-country]].\n\nIn 2016 \"Mississippi Moon\" and \"Cowboy Cliché\" from ''Wrong Side of the River'' were featured on the Netflix original series ''The Ranch''.\n\nBaird's highly anticipated fourth record ''After All'' was released January 11, 2019.\n\n==Critical reception==\n\nRoughstock Country gave ''I Swear It's the Truth'' 4.5/5 stars, saying \"Everything about ''I Swear It's The Truth'' suggests a young artist ready to break into the big leagues.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.roughstock.com/reviews/album-review-rob-baird-i-swear-it-s-the-truth |title=Album Review: Rob Baird - I Swear It's the Truth &#124; Country Music Reviews, Taylor Swift to Lady Antebellum &#124; Roughstock.com |access-date=June 19, 2014 |archive-date=April 15, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130415064019/http://www.roughstock.com/reviews/album-review-rob-baird-i-swear-it-s-the-truth |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n[[Spin Magazine]] included ''I Swear It's the Truth'' on their \"Top Albums of 2012\" list, calling him a \"young, affable folk-pop charmer.\"<ref name=\"121217-19-rob-baird\"/>\n\nBaird was featured in ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s \"Spotlight\" section in May 2012 covering the release of ''I Swear It's the Truth''.<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-615/485451/spotlight-rob-baird-spreads-truth-with-new-album|title=Spotlight: Rob Baird Spreads 'Truth' with New Album|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=May 30, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015 the Dallas Observer slated Baird's \"Dreams and Gasoline\" to be one of the 50 best Texas Red Dirt Songs<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dallasobserver.com/music/the-50-best-red-dirt-texas-country-songs-7055741|title=The 50 Best Red Dirt Texas Country Songs}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, Baird premiered a three-part video series featuring songs from ''Wrong Side of The River'' on NPR, stating that the videos and the music were \"a thematic journey from defiance to reflection to the hope for redemption\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/event/music/476464506/rob-baird-wrong-side-of-the-river-trilogy|title = First Watch: Rob Baird, 'Wrong Side of the River' Trilogy|newspaper = NPR|date = May 3, 2016|last1 = Sinnenberg|first1 = Jackson}}</ref> No Depression stated that ''Wrong Side of The River'' as \"Wrenching punches to the gut, with powerhouse blues rock and soul, as well as poignant pulls on our hearts with heart-rending ballads\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nodepression.com/article/rob-baird-has-run-good-luck |title=Rob Baird Has a Run of Good Luck {{!}} No Depression |website=nodepression.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160619155022/http://nodepression.com/article/rob-baird-has-run-good-luck |archive-date=2016-06-19}}</ref> Spin Magazine described ''Wrong Side of The River'' as \"Baird takes his traditional country to a deeper place, with sparse acoustic chords allowing his reflective lyricism to breathe\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.spin.com/2016/04/rob-baird-horses-premiere-stream/|title = Rob Baird Finds New, Folk-Laden Path with 'Horses'|date = April 21, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Albums===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:14em;\"| Title\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:20em;\"| Album details\n! colspan=\"2\"| Peak chart<br />positions\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n! width=\"45\"| [[Top Country Albums|US Country]]<br /><ref>{{cite magazine|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=rob baird|chart=all}}|title=Rob Baird Album & Song Chart History – Country Albums|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|accessdate=May 31, 2012}}</ref>\n! width=\"45\"| [[Top Heatseekers|US<br />Heat]]<br /><ref>{{cite magazine|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=rob baird|chart=Heatseekers Albums}}|title=Rob Baird Album & Song Chart History – Heatseekers Albums|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|accessdate=May 31, 2012}}</ref>\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Blue Eyed Angels''\n| \n* Release date: August 31, 2010\n* Label: Carnival Recording Company\n| —\n| —\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''I Swear It's the Truth''\n| \n* Release date: May 22, 2012\n* Label: Carnival Recording Company\n| 57\n| 35\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Wrong Side of the River''\n| \n* Release date: May 13, 2016\n* Label: Hard Luck Recording Company\n| 48\n| 2\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''After All''<br />\n|\n*Release date: January 11, 2019\n* Label: Hard Luck Recording Company\n| 32\n| 2\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Anthems''<br />\n|\n*Release date: May 19, 2022\n* Label: Carnival Recording Company\n| —\n| —\n|-\n| colspan=\"10\" style=\"font-size:8pt\"| \"—\" denotes releases that did not chart\n|-\n|}\n\n===Music videos===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!
