He is considered one of the pioneers of the [[Outlaw country|outlaw movement]] in [[country music]].\n\nJennings started playing guitar at age eight and performed at fourteen on [[KVOW]] radio, after which he formed his first band, the Texas Longhorns. Jennings left high school at age sixteen, determined to become a musician, and worked as a performer and DJ on KVOW, [[KDAV]], [[KYTI]], [[KBZO (AM)|KLLL]], in [[Coolidge, Arizona]], and [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]. In 1958, [[Buddy Holly]] arranged Jennings's first recording session, a cover of [[Jole Blon]], and hired him to play bass. Jennings gave up his seat on the [[The Day the Music Died|ill-fated flight]] in 1959 that crashed and killed Holly, [[The Big Bopper|J. P. \"the Big Bopper\" Richardson]] and [[Ritchie Valens]].\n\nJennings then returned to Texas, taking several years off from music before eventually moving to Arizona and forming a [[rockabilly]] club band, [[the Waylors]], which became the house band at \"JD's\", a club in Tempe, Arizona.<ref>{{Cite web |date=April 18, 2019 |title=Report to the Board of Adjustment Prepared by the Maricopa County Planning and Development Department |url=https://www.maricopa.gov/AgendaCenter/ViewFile/Item/7079?fileID=46736 |website=www.maricopa.gov}}</ref> He recorded for independent label Trend Records and [[A&M Records]], but did not achieve success until moving to [[RCA Victor]] in 1965. In 1972 he acquired Neil Reshen as his manager, who negotiated significantly better touring and recording contracts. After he gained creative control from [[RCA Records]], he released the critically acclaimed albums ''[[Lonesome, On'ry and Mean]]'' and ''[[Honky Tonk Heroes]]'', followed by the hit albums ''[[Dreaming My Dreams (Waylon Jennings album)|Dreaming My Dreams]]'' and ''[[Are You Ready for the Country]]''.\n\nDuring the 1970s, Jennings drove [[outlaw country]]. With [[Willie Nelson]], [[Tompall Glaser]], and [[Jessi Colter]] he recorded country music's first platinum album, ''[[Wanted! The Outlaws]]''. It was followed by another platinum album, a first for any solo artist in country music, ''[[Ol' Waylon]]'', and the hit song \"[[Luckenbach, Texas (Back to the Basics of Love)|Luckenbach, Texas]]\". He was featured on the 1978 album ''[[White Mansions]]'', performed by various artists documenting the lives of Confederates during the Civil War. He appeared in films and television series, including [[Sesame Street]] and a stint as the balladeer on ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard]]'', composing and singing [[Theme from The Dukes of Hazzard (Good Ol' Boys)|its theme song]] and narrating the show.\n\nJennings struggled with [[cocaine]] addiction, which he overcame in 1984. Later, he joined the country [[supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[The Highwaymen (country supergroup)|the Highwaymen]] with [[Willie Nelson]], [[Kris Kristofferson]], and [[Johnny Cash]], which released three albums between 1985 and 1995. During that period, Jennings released the successful album ''[[Will the Wolf Survive]]''. He has been named as one of the innovators of [[progressive country]].<ref name=Rockwell>{{cite web |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1976/04/08/archives/the-pop-life-progressive-country-music.html|title=The Pop Life |last=Rockwell|first=John |date=April 8, 1976 |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=July 22, 2023 |quote=The term \"progressive\" country normally applies to a Texas‐based coterie around Willie Nelson and such Nashville‐centered innovators as Waylon Jennings and Tompall Glaser.}}</ref>\n\nJennings toured less after 1997 to spend more time with his family. Between 1999 and 2001, health problems limited his appearances. In 2001, he was inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]]. In 2007, he was posthumously awarded the Cliffie Stone Pioneer Award by the [[Academy of Country Music]].\n\n== Early life ==\nJennings was born on June 15, 1937, on the J.W. Bittner farm near [[Littlefield, Texas]]. He was the son of Lorene Beatrice (née Shipley, 1920–2006) and William Albert Jennings (1915–1968).{{sfn|Jennings|Kaye|1996|p=4}} The Jennings family line descended from Irish and [[Black-Dutch]].{{sfn|Jennings|Kaye|1996|p=10}} He was the oldest of four children, followed by [[Tommy Jennings]] (1938–2019), James Jennings, and Bo Jennings (1953–2018).<ref name=\"Classic Country Music\">{{cite web|url=https://classiccountrymusic.com/waylon-jennings-brother-has-passed-away/|title=Waylon Jennings' Brother Has Passed Away|date=May 2019 |publisher=Classic Country Music|access-date=October 25, 2023}}</ref> The Shipley line descended from his great-grandfather, a farmer and lawman from [[Tennessee]], with Jennings adding that \"along the way, a lot of Indian blood mixed in,\" including [[Cherokee]] and [[Comanche]] families.{{sfn|Jennings|Kaye|1996|pp=9–11}}\n\nThe name on Jennings' birth certificate was Wayland. It was changed after a Baptist preacher visited his parents and congratulated his mother for naming him after the Wayland Baptist College, now [[Wayland Baptist University]], in [[Plainview, Texas]]. Lorene Jennings, who was [[Churches of Christ|Church of Christ]] and had been unaware of the college, changed the spelling to Waylon. Jennings later expressed in his autobiography, \"I didn't like Waylon. It sounded so corny and hillbilly, but it's been good to me, and I'm pretty well at peace with it now.\"{{sfn|Jennings|Kaye|1996|p=6}} After working as a laborer on the Bittner farm, Jennings's father moved the family to Littlefield and established a [[Creamery|retail creamery]].{{sfn|Jasinski|p=432|2012}}\n\n== Career ==\n=== Beginnings in music ===\nWhen Jennings was 8, his mother taught him to play guitar with the tune \"Thirty Pieces of Silver\".

He won a talent show at [[KLBK-TV|Channel 13]], in Lubbock, singing \"[[Hey Joe (Carl Smith song)|Hey Joe]]\". He later made frequent performances at the Palace Theater in Littlefield, during local talent night.{{sfn|Jennings|Kaye|1996|p=36}}\n\nAt age 14, Jennings auditioned for a spot on KVOW in Littlefield, Texas. Owner J.B. McShan, along with Emil Macha, recorded Jennings' performance. McShan liked his style and hired him for a weekly 30-minute program. Following his performance on the show, Jennings formed his own band. He asked Macha to play bass for him and gathered other friends and acquaintances to form the Texas Longhorns. The style of the band—a mixture of [[country and western]] and [[bluegrass music]]—was often not well received.{{sfn|Carr|Munde|1997|p=154}}\n\n[[File:Waylon Jennings KLLL.jpg|thumb|200px|Jennings during a broadcast of his show on KLLL in 1958]]\nAfter several disciplinary infractions, 16-year-old Jennings was convinced to drop out of Littlefield High School by the superintendent.{{sfn|Burton, Alan|2002|p=79}} Upon leaving school, he worked for his father in the family store and also took temporary jobs.

A private courier warned the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] about the package sent to Jennings by a New York colleague that contained 27 grams of cocaine.
