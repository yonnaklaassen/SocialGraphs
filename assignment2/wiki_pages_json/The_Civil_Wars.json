Williams had recorded several moderately successful albums and was signed as a songwriter to Warner/Chappell; White had independently released ''The Long Goodbye''—which was originally set to be released through a deal with Capitol Records—and was writing for EMI Music.  At the workshop, approximately 25 songwriters were assembled by music publishers to write [[hit singles|radio singles]] for an unnamed band later identified as the country group [[Gloriana (band)|Gloriana]].  Williams and White were randomly paired to write together, and quickly discovered an affinity.  In a 2012 interview, Williams said that \"when he started singing it was like I knew where he was going to go before he went there.\"  In the same interview, White said that when he and Williams \"started singing together, there was this weird click; it was like there was a dance going where I knew I could lead her but she could lead me, too.\" Following the workshop, White and Williams made immediate plans to meet again.  They wrote the song \"Falling\" during their first session, which took place at Williams' house.<ref name=\"How We Met\">{{cite news|last1=Richman|first1=Simmy|title=How We Met: Joy Williams & John Paul White|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/how-we-met-joy-williams--john-paul-white-7574200.html|access-date=August 27, 2014|work=The Independent|date=March 18, 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"Nashville Scene - Long Bio\">{{cite news|last1=Gold|first1=Adam|title=How The Civil Wars fought for artistic independence and broadsided Music Row|url=http://www.nashvillescene.com/nashville/how-the-civil-wars-fought-for-artistic-independence-and-broadsided-music-row/Content?oid=2673301|access-date=August 30, 2014|publisher=Nashville Scene|date=November 10, 2011|archive-date=August 8, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808042903/http://www.nashvillescene.com/nashville/how-the-civil-wars-fought-for-artistic-independence-and-broadsided-music-row/Content?oid=2673301|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nLooking for a name for the project, Williams came up with the Civil Wars, which has no historical meaning, but rather is based on the quote \"be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle\" attributed to [[Ian Maclaren]].<ref>{{cite web|url= https://quoteinvestigator.com/2010/06/29/be-kind/|accessdate=29 September 2021|title= Be Kind; Everyone You Meet is Fighting a Hard Battle|website=[[Quote Investigator]]|date=June 29, 2010 }}</ref> According to Williams, \"as I was thinking about the music we make, that sense of battle seemed applicable.\"<ref name=\"New York Times\">{{cite news|last1=McKinley|first1=James C.|title=Their Year of Living Almost Famously|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/26/arts/music/talking-to-joy-williams-and-john-paul-white-of-the-civil-wars.html|access-date=August 30, 2014|work=The New York Times|date=October 25, 2011}}</ref>  The duo performed for the first time as The Civil Wars at the French Quarter Cafe in Nashville on April 7, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Reverte|first1=Michelle|title=Interview: Joy Williams and John Paul White of The Civil Wars|url=http://laist.com/2011/06/13/the_civil_wars.php|website=laist.com|publisher=The LAIST|access-date=August 29, 2014|date=June 13, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140609031600/http://laist.com/2011/06/13/the_civil_wars.php|archive-date=June 9, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref>  Williams' former producer [[Charlie Peacock]] was in attendance, and impressed by their dynamics and on-stage chemistry, began working with them the following day.<ref name=\"Charlie Peacock Interview\">{{cite web|last1=Inglis|first1=Sam|title=The Civil Wars chose to avoid the usual studio trickery for their debut album, and have reaped great success as a result.|url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/apr12/articles/the-civil-wars.htm|website=soundonsound.com|publisher=Sound on Sound|access-date=August 29, 2014|date=April 2012}}</ref>  On April 8, 2009, Shalom Aberle recorded The Civil Wars' second live show, opening for [[Will Hoge]] at [[Eddie's Attic]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Civil Wars - Live at Eddie's Attic (Credits)|url=http://www.discogs.com/Civil-Wars-Live-At-Eddies-Attic/release/2745375|website=discogs.com|date=June 30, 2009 |publisher=Discogs|access-date=September 1, 2014}}</ref> Eight of the songs that were recorded that night were on ''[[Live at Eddie's Attic]]'', which was released through Sensibility Music on June 30, 2009 as a free download on The Civil Wars' website.
