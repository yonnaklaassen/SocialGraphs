He was born Bryon Keith Palmer on June 23, 1957, in [[Hayti, Missouri]], United States, and was raised in [[Corning, Arkansas]]. His name was actually supposed to be \"Byron\", but there was a mistake on the birth certificate.\n\nHe began his music career in 1975 as pianist for [[the Dixie Echoes]], where he remained for three years. In 1991, Palmer released an album for [[Epic Records]] which produced two singles: \"Don't Throw Me in the Briarpatch\" and \"Forgotten but Not Gone\", both of which entered the U.S. Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart (now [[Hot Country Songs]]). He also co-wrote [[Reba McEntire]]'s 1991 single \"[[For My Broken Heart (song)|For My Broken Heart]]\". Palmer died of cancer on June 13, 1996, in [[White House, Tennessee]], at age 38.\n\n==''Keith Palmer'' (1991)==\n{{Infobox album\n| italic_title = no\n| name         = Keith Palmer\n| type         = studio\n| artist       = Keith Palmer\n| cover        = keithpalmer.jpg\n| alt          =\n| released     = {{start date|1991|11|05}}\n| recorded     =\n| venue        =\n| studio       = The Bennett House, [[Franklin, TN]]\n| genre        = Country\n| length       = 31:43\n| label        = Epic No.&nbsp;48611\n| producer     = [[Bob Montgomery (songwriter)|Bob Montgomery]]\n| prev_title   =\n| prev_year    =\n| next_title   =\n| next_year    =\n}}\n\n===Track listing===\n#\"Memory Lane\" ([[Lonnie Wilson]], [[Joe Diffie]]) – 3:15\n#\"Forgotten but Not Gone\" (Johnny MacRae, [[Buzz Cason]]) – 3:27\n#\"If You Want to Find Love\" ([[Skip Ewing]], [[Max D.
