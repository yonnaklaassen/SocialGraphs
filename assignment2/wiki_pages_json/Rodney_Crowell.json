Crowell has had five number one singles on [[Hot Country Songs]], all from his 1988 album ''[[Diamonds & Dirt]]''. He has also written songs and produced for other artists.\n\nHe was influenced by songwriters [[Guy Clark]] and [[Townes Van Zandt]]. Crowell played guitar and sang for three years in [[Emmylou Harris]]' Hot Band.\n\nHe has won two [[Grammy Awards]] in his career, one in 1990 for [[Grammy Award for Best Country Song|Best Country Song]] for the song \"[[After All This Time (Rodney Crowell song)|After All This Time]]\" and one in 2014 [[Grammy Award for Best Americana Album|Best Americana Album]] for his album ''[[Old Yellow Moon]]''.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Bookbits - 2011-03-01 Rodney Crowell-Chinaberry Sidewalks.vorb.oga|thumb|right|Crowell on Bookbits radio.]]\nCrowell was born on August 7, 1950, in Houston, Texas, to James Walter Crowell and Addie Cauzette Willoughby.<ref>Chinaberry Sidewalks, New York: [[Alfred A.

His grandmother played guitar and his father sang semi-professionally at bars and [[honky tonk]]s.<ref name=\"Anon\"/> At age 11, he started playing drums in his father's band.

After he sat in with Emmylou at her gig at the [[Armadillo World Headquarters]] in early January 1975, she asked him to play rhythm guitar in her backing band, The Hot Band.

Records]] and in August 1978, released his debut album, ''[[Ain't Living Long Like This]]''.\n\nHis debut album, as well as his following two albums, ''[[But What Will the Neighbors Think]]'' and ''[[Rodney Crowell (album)|Rodney Crowell]]'', were not commercially successful despite garnering a huge cult following. Crowell himself criticized his debut album for not translating onto vinyl the same clarity and energy he felt in the studio. His single \"Ashes by Now\" from \"But What Will the Neighbors Think\" reached No.&nbsp;37 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1980.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://top40weekly.com/1980-all-charts/|title=All US Top 40 Singles for 1980|website=Top40Weekly.com|date=February 6, 2013 |language=en-US|access-date=March 30, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThough he had already several country hits by artists covering his songs (including \"[[I Ain't Living Long Like This]]\" by [[Waylon Jennings]], \"[[Leaving Louisiana in the Broad Daylight|Leaving Louisiana...]]\" by the [[Oak Ridge Boys]], and several covers by [[Johnny Cash]], [[Rosanne Cash]], Emmylou Harris, [[Jerry Reed]] and others), Crowell got his first big taste of pop songwriting success with \"[[Shame on the Moon]]\". \"Shame on the Moon\" was recorded on the 1982 album ''[[The Distance (Bob Seger album)|The Distance]]'' by [[Bob Seger & the Silver Bullet Band]]. [[Glenn Frey]] joined Seger on background harmony on the song. Appealing to a broad cross-section of listeners, the song spent four weeks at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 pop singles chart, topped the adult contemporary chart, and placed in the Top 15 of the country chart in early 1983. The song's dark, poetic and hypnotic style helped boost Crowell's cult status.\n\nThe album ''[[Rodney Crowell (album)|Rodney Crowell]]'' was released in 1981 (see [[1981 in country music]]) by Warner Bros. Records and was his last album on that label before switching to Columbia. The first album Crowell produced by himself, it reached No.&nbsp;47 on the Top Country Albums chart and No.&nbsp;105 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] albums chart. The songs \"Stars on the Water\" and \"Victim or a Fool\" were released as singles. \"Stars on the Water\" reached No.&nbsp;30 on the Hot Country Songs chart, Crowell's highest charting song up to that point. It peaked at No.&nbsp;21 on the Canadian country charts. \"Victim or a Fool\" reached No.&nbsp;34 in the U.S.\n\nIn 1981, Crowell put his career on hold to produce several of his wife Rosanne Cash's albums.<ref name=\"Mary\"/>\n\nIn 1983, [[Crystal Gayle]] had a number one country single with his song \"[['Til I Gain Control Again]]\" from her first Elektra album, ''[[True Love (Crystal Gayle album)|True Love]]''. The song was first recorded in 1975 by Emmylou Harris and appeared on ''[[Elite Hotel]]'' that year.\n\nIn 1984, Crowell returned to working on his own music career and recorded what was to be a new album for Warner Bros., ''Street Language''.<ref name=\"DeYoung\">{{cite web|url=http://www.billdeyoung.com/music-archives/the-ballad-of-rodney-crowell/|title=The Ballad of Rodney Crowell – Bill DeYoung dot com|date=May 27, 2014|website=Billdeyoung.com|access-date=November 6, 2018}}</ref> That album, a pop-sounding effort co–produced by David Malloy, was rejected by Warner Bros and never released.  Warner Bros. requested a more Nashville-friendly record, but Crowell negotiated a release from his contract and moved to [[Columbia Records]].<ref name=\"DeYoung\"/>\n\n===1986–1995: Columbia Records and mainstream success===\nAfter producing Rosanne Cash's ''[[Rhythm & Romance (Rosanne Cash album)|Rhythm & Romance]]'', Crowell signed to [[Columbia Records]] in 1986.  His first album for that label was reworked ''[[Street Language (album)|Street Language]]'',<ref name=\"DeYoung\"/> co-produced with [[Booker T.

His critically acclaimed album 1988's ''[[Diamonds & Dirt]]'' produced five consecutive No.&nbsp;1 singles during a 17-month span in 1988 and 1989: \"[[It's Such a Small World]]\" (a duet with Cash), \"[[I Couldn't Leave You If I Tried]],\" \"[[She's Crazy For Leavin']],\" \"[[After All This Time (Rodney Crowell song)|After All This Time]]\" and \"[[Above and Beyond (song)|Above and Beyond]]\" (a cover of [[Buck Owens]]' 1962 hit).  Crowell's \"After All This Time\" won the 1990 [[Grammy Award]] for [[Best Country Song]].  His follow-up album, 1989's ''[[Keys to the Highway]]'', produced two top 5 hits in 1990, which were \"[[Many a Long and Lonesome Highway]]\" and \"[[If Looks Could Kill (Rodney Crowell song)|If Looks Could Kill]].\"\n\nAfter 1992's ''[[Life Is Messy]]'', he left Columbia Records and signed to [[MCA Records]] where he released two more albums — ''[[Let the Picture Paint Itself]]'' and ''[[Jewel of the South]]''.\n\n===2001–2010: Songwriting success, critical acclaim===\n\nCrowell continued to enjoy success as a songwriter in the 1990s and 2000s.  Crowell's songs that reached to Top Ten in the country charts in the decade included \"[[Song for the Life]]\" by [[Alan Jackson]], \"[[Making Memories of Us]]\" by [[Keith Urban]], \"[[Ashes by Now]]\" by [[Lee Ann Womack]], and \"[[Please Remember Me]]\" by [[Tim McGraw]].\n\nIn 2001, after a brief hiatus from recording, Crowell released ''[[The Houston Kid]]'' on [[Sugar Hill Records (bluegrass)|Sugar Hill Records]], his first studio album since 1995's ''[[Jewel of the South]]''. Many songs on the album were semi-autobiographical, and the album included a duet Crowell had recorded and released as a single in 1998 with his ex father-in-law [[Johnny Cash]], \"[[I Walk the Line Revisited]]\". Crowell followed up this effort with ''[[Fate's Right Hand (album)|Fate's Right Hand]]'' in 2003 and ''[[The Outsider (Rodney Crowell album)|The Outsider]]'' in 2005, both of which appeared on [[Columbia Nashville]], a division of [[Sony Music]]. Leading critics and Crowell consider these three albums his finest work as a solo artist.\n\nRodney Crowell was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2003 with fellow inductees Hal Blair, [[Paul Overstreet]] and [[John Prine]].\n\n2004 saw the release of ''[[The Notorious Cherry Bombs]]'', a reunion of Crowell's 1970s road band, including [[Vince Gill]] and [[Tony Brown (record producer)|Tony Brown]]. The future [[Keith Urban]] hit \"[[Making Memories of Us]]\" was included on this disc. In 2005, Crowell served as producer for established Irish singer-songwriter [[Kieran Goss]] on the album \"Blue Sky Sunrise\".\n\nIn 2007, Rodney Crowell was inducted into the [[Music City Walk of Fame]].\n\nCrowell released his next album, ''[[Sex & Gasoline]]'', on [[Yep Roc Records]] in 2008, ending his relationship with Sony Music.
