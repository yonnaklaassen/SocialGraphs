While a freshman, Porter portrayed Anita in ''[[West Side Story]]'', and as a senior played the lead in ''Cinderella''. After Porter won ''The Voice'' in 2016, her former high school drama teacher said she was not surprised by the result. \"She blew everybody away\" with her performance in ''West Side Story'', and \"really seemed to get the best out of everybody else.
