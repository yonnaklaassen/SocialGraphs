She is perhaps best known for her work in the late 1970s with [[Neil Young]] and her 1978 hit single of Young's \"[[Lotta Love]]\", which hit No.&nbsp;1 on the [[Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks]] chart<ref name=adult/> and No.&nbsp;8 on the pop singles chart.<ref name=us/> It was followed by four more [[adult contemporary]] hits, two of which were also minor pop hits.\n\nBy 1985, she shifted her focus to [[country music]], charting six times on the US country singles chart.<ref name=country/> Her only top-40 country hit was \"That's How You Know When Love's Right\", a duet with [[Steve Wariner]]. She died in 1997 of [[cerebral edema]] and [[liver failure]].\n\n== Early life and career ==\nNicolette Larson was born in [[Helena, Montana]].<ref name=larson2>{{cite news |title=Obituary: Nicolette Larson |last=Perrone|first=Pierre|newspaper=Independent|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/obituary-nicolette-larson-1290653.html|date=December 27, 1997|access-date=September 5, 2011}}</ref><ref name=larsonallm>{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p18807|pure_url=yes}} |title=Biography: Nicolette Larson |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |publisher=Allmusic |access-date=September 6, 2011}}</ref> Her father's employment with the [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury Department]] necessitated frequent relocation for the family. She graduated from high school in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], where she attended the [[University of Missouri-Kansas City|University of Missouri]] for three semesters and worked at waitressing and office jobs before beginning to pursue the musical career she had dreamed of since singing along to the radio as a child.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Larson eventually settled in [[San Francisco, California]], where she worked in a record store (Discount Records, on [[Telegraph Avenue]] in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], which also sold tickets for shows at the [[Fillmore West]] and [[Winterland]]) and for the Golden Gate Country Bluegrass Festival. Turning to singing, her performance career began with  a booking as the opening act for [[Eric Andersen]] at The Egress, a club in [[Vancouver|Vancouver, British Columbia]]. In 1975, Larson auditioned for [[Hoyt Axton]], who was producing [[Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen|Commander Cody]]. This led to Larson singing with Hoyt Axton and The Banana Band, who were opening for [[Joan Baez]] on the \"Diamonds and Rust\" tour in 1975. She earned her first recording credit on Commander Cody's 1975 album ''Tales From the Ozone'', toured with his band and also provided background vocals on subsequent Commander Cody albums in 1977 and 1978. Other early career singing credits were for Axton and [[Guy Clark]], both in 1976; the following year her resume included further credits with [[Mary Kay Place]], [[Rodney Crowell]], [[Billy Joe Shaver]], [[Jesse Colin Young]], [[Jesse Winchester]], and [[Gary Stewart (singer)|Gary Stewart]].\n\nLarson and Guthrie Thomas both had their first professional recording session on Axton's ''Southbound'' album for A&M Records. As newcomers to the recording industry, they were listed on the back cover of the album as \"Street Singers\", entirely separate from the highly paid, more established artists also appearing on the album.<ref>{{Cite web |title = Nicolette Larson (vocal credits) |url = http://www.discogs.com/artist/249839-Nicolette-Larson?filter_anv=0&type=Credits |website = Discogs |access-date = 2016-01-14}}</ref>\n\nLarson's work with [[Emmylou Harris]] – whose 1977 album ''[[Luxury Liner (album)|Luxury Liner]]'' prominently showcased Larson on the song \"Hello Stranger\" – led to her meeting and then befriending Harris's associate and friend [[Linda Ronstadt]]. In 1977, Larson was at Ronstadt's [[Malibu, California|Malibu]] home when neighbor [[Neil Young]] phoned to ask Ronstadt if she could recommend a female vocal accompanist. Ronstadt suggested Larson; she was the third person that day to mention Larson to Young. He came over to meet Larson, who recalled, \"Neil ran down all the songs he had just written, about twenty of them. We sang harmonies with him and he was jazzed.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.theuncool.com/journalism/rs280-nicolette-larson |title=Nicolette Larson's Time Has Come |first=Cameron |last=Crowe |author-link=Cameron Crowe |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |number=280 |date=November 14, 1978 |issn=0035-791X}}</ref>\n\nThe following week Ronstadt and Larson cut their vocals for Young's ''[[American Stars 'n Bars]]'' album at Young's [[La Honda, California|La Honda]] ranch – the two women were billed on the album as the Bullets – and, in November 1977, Young invited Larson to [[Nashville]] to sing on his ''[[Comes a Time]]'' album. This led to Larson's being signed to [[Warner Bros. Records]].\n\nLarson continued her background singing career into 1978, accruing credit on recordings by [[Marcia Ball]], [[Rodney Crowell]], Emmylou Harris (''[[Quarter Moon in a Ten Cent Town]]''), and [[Norton Buffalo]]. She also sang on [[the Doobie Brothers]]' ''[[Minute by Minute]]''. That album's producer, [[Ted Templeman]], then produced Larson's debut album, ''[[Nicolette (album)|Nicolette]]''.<ref name=larson>{{cite magazine |title=Music World Says Goodbye To Nicolette Larson |last=Cramer |first=Christina |magazine=Rolling Stone |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/music-world-says-goodbye-to-nicolette-larson-19971218 |date=December 18, 1997 |access-date=August 9, 2011}}</ref>\n\n== 1978–1983 ==\nLarson's work with Commander Cody had led to her being signed to the [[country music|C&W]] division of [[Warner Bros. Records]]. However her debut album ''[[Nicolette (album)|Nicolette]]'', released September 29, 1978, was an eclectic mix of rock, C&W and R&B.\n\nDespite the release of her album so late in the year, Larson was acclaimed Female Vocalist of 1978 by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', which wrote no one else could sound as if she were having so much fun on an album. ''Nicolette'' reached No.&nbsp;15 on Billboard's album chart aided by the hit single \"[[Lotta Love]]\", a [[Neil Young]] composition. Larson's \"Lotta Love\" hit #1 on the Easy Listening/Adult Contemporary chart and went Top 10 Pop in February 1979. Linda Ronstadt, Valerie Carter, Bill Payne, James Burton, and [[Patrick Simmons]] performed on the ''[[Nicolette (album)|Nicolette]]'' album.<ref>[https://www.wincityvoices.org/art/music/jeffs-playlist-nicolette/ Nicolette] wincityvoices.org Retrieved 22 August 2024</ref> <!--the same week the single off(an Ian & Sylvia record with Larson uncredited on the single), debuted on the Hot 100 on its way to a No.&nbsp;61 peak. (\"Sail Away\", a track featuring Larson, from the ''Comes a Time'' sessions or was included on the otherwise live Neil Young album released in 1979-->\n\nWarner Brothers also issued the limited edition (5,000 copies) promo-only ''Live at the [[Roxy Theatre (West Hollywood)|Roxy]]'' album comprising a December 20, 1978, concert given by Larson at the [[Sunset Boulevard]] nightclub. Larson was also featured on the ''[[No Nukes (album)|No Nukes]]'' album recorded in September 1979 at [[Madison Square Garden]], backed by [[the Doobie Brothers]] in her performance of \"Lotta Love\".\n\nLarson would be unable to consolidate the commercial success augured by her debut: the second single off ''Nicolette'', \"Rhumba Girl\"<ref>\"Rhumba Girl\" was written by Jesse Winchester, who introduced it as \"Rhumba Man\" on his ''Nothing But a Breeze'' album. Although Larson had been a session singer on ''Nothing But a Breeze'' she had not sung on \"Rhumba Man\", first hearing the song at a live performance by Winchester.</ref> just missed becoming a major hit for Larson at No.&nbsp;48. Her second album, ''In the Nick of Time,'' released November 1979, failed to showcase Larson's voice attractively. Don Shewey in ''Rolling Stone'' wrote:<blockquote>Larson's rough-edged, down-home tone is definitely appealing – especially when she backs up the likes of Neil Young and [[Steve Goodman]] [whose ''High and Outside'' album featured a duet with Larson: \"The One That Got Away\"] – but as a soloist, her limited vocal resources are \"severely taxed\" – \"It's symptomatic of Nicolette Larson's problems as a performer that the finest singing on ''In the Nick of Time'' is by [[Michael McDonald (singer)|Michael McDonald]]. 'Let Me Go, Love'&nbsp;... McDonald's entrancing vocal presence&nbsp;... so overshadows Larson's that she seems to be playing second fiddle rather than sharing the lead. Elsewhere, Larson is dwarfed by [[Ted Templeman]]'s typically luxurious production\".<ref name=\"larson\"/></blockquote>\n\nReleased as the album's lead single, \"Let Me Go Love\" reached only No.&nbsp;35 in February 1980. That year Larson was heard on the airwaves via guest appearances on \"Say You'll Be Mine\" by [[Christopher Cross]] and the [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band|Dirt Band]]'s \"Make a Little Magic\". Larson had enough residual popularity from her debut for ''In the Nick of Time'' to become a moderate success. Because she had no major hit, Larson's 1981 and 1982 album releases, ''[[Radioland (album)|Radioland]]'' (her last album produced by Templeman) and ''[[All Dressed Up and No Place to Go]]'', were unsuccessful, even though both releases showed Larson back in strong vocal form. In 1982 Larson received some [[adult contemporary music|adult-contemporary]] radio airplay with her remake of \"[[I Only Want to Be With You]]\" (No. 53).<ref>[https://www.sessiondays.com/2022/04/1982-nicolette-larson-i-only-want-to-be-with-you-us53/ I Only Want to Be With You] sessiondays.com  Retrieved 22 August 2024</ref>\n\nLarson had continued her background singing career accruing credits on releases by [[Tom Johnston (musician)|Tom Johnston]], [[Linda Ronstadt]] (''[[Mad Love (Linda Ronstadt album)|Mad Love]]''), [[Graham Nash]], [[John Stewart (folk musician)|John Stewart]], [[Albert Hammond]], and [[Rita Coolidge]]. Larson again backed [[the Doobie Brothers]] on their ''[[One Step Closer (The Doobie Brothers album)|One Step Closer]]'' album; she can be heard on the hit \"Real Love.\" A song Larson co-wrote with [[John McFee]] and [[Patrick Simmons]] titled \"Can't Let It Get Away\" was a 1981 single release for the Doobie Brothers in [[Japan]]. <!--Larson contributed a harmony vocal on the track \"Could This Be Magic\" on the [[Van Halen]] album ''[[Women and Children First (album)|Women and Children First]]'' (1980), to thank [[Eddie Van Halen]] for playing guitar on the ''Nicolette'' album track \"Can't Get Away From You,\" against [[David Lee Roth]]'s wishes.-->\n\nLarson's recording of the [[Burt Bacharach]]/[[Carole Bayer Sager]] song \"Fool Me Again\" was featured on the bestselling soundtrack album for the 1981 film ''[[Arthur (1981 film)|Arthur]],'' despite not being heard in the film. Larson was also featured on the soundtrack album for ''[[National Lampoon's Vacation]]'' (1983) with the track \"Summer Hearts\".<ref>{{Citation|title=National Lampoon's Vacation - Original Soundtrack {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/national-lampoons-vacation-mw0000892869|language=en|access-date=2022-01-02}}</ref>\n\nLarson's appearance in a touring production of the [[country music|C&W]] musical ''[[Pump Boys and Dinettes]]'' garnered enough positive reaction for [[MCA Records|MCA Nashville]] to sign her in 1983.\n\n== 1984–1997 ==\nThe Nashville music community was so enthused about Larson's C&W cross-over that in 1984 the Academy of Country Music named her the Best New Female Vocalist before she had any MCA Nashville releases. Larson's MCA debut ''[[...Say When]]'' was not released until 1985 (by which point country pop was no longer in style and [[neotraditional country|neotraditionalists]] had taken over the country scene). The C&W career it ushered in for Larson proved anticlimactic with only one of her six MCA single releases becoming a significant hit: her duet with [[Steve Wariner]] titled \"That's How You Know When Love's Right,\" taken from the April 1986 album release ''[[Rose of My Heart]].'' The record reached No.&nbsp;9 C&W. Larson's MCA albums, produced by [[Emory Gordy Jr.]] and [[Tony Brown (record producer)|Tony Brown]], attracted little critical attention. Her final mainstream album release was ''[[Shadows of Love]]'', a 1988 recording made for the Italian [[Compagnia Generale del Disco|CGD]] label and produced by Carlo Stretti and Ernesto Taberelli. It was her only album for a non-US label. \n\nIn 1992 Larson reunited professionally with [[Neil Young]] to sing on his ''[[Harvest Moon (album)|Harvest Moon]]'' album. In 1993 she was featured on Young's ''[[Unplugged (Neil Young album)|Unplugged]]''. <!--She also provided vocal accompaniment on \"The Little Drummer Boy\" and \"Greensleeves\", two of the tracks Young contributed to ''Seven Gates: A Christmas Album by [[Ben Keith]] and Friends'' (1994).-->Larson's final album was the self-produced ''Sleep, Baby, Sleep'', consisting of music for children, released by [[Sony Wonder]] in 1994.<ref>[https://www.allmusic.com/album/sleep-baby-sleep-mw0000247700 Sleep, Baby, Sleep] allmusic access-date=22 August 2024</ref>\n\nLarson also contributed to the seasonal albums ''Tennessee Christmas '' (1987) with \"One Bright Star\", ''Acoustic Christmas'' (1988) with \"Christmas Is a Time for Giving,\" and ''Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas'' (1989) with \"Nothing But a Child\" and \"One Bright Star\".

Larson and DeVito later married and divorced. She also dated Neil Young during the ''Comes a Time'' sessions. In the early 1980s, Larson was engaged to [[Andrew Gold]], but their relationship ended shortly after the completion of Larson's 1982 album ''All Dressed Up and No Place to Go,'' which Gold had produced. In the late 1980s, she briefly dated [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://weirdal.com/archives/miscellaneous/ask-al/#0299|title=Ask Al {{!}} \"Weird Al\" Yankovic |last=Yankovic |first=Weird Al |website=\"Weird Al\" Yankovic |access-date=September 7, 2016}}</ref> Yankovic would later compose \"You Don't Love Me Anymore\", a style parody of Larson's work, for his 1992 album ''[[Off the Deep End]]''.
