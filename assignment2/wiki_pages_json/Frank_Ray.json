Signed to [[BBR Music Group]], he has released the single \"Country'd Look Good on You\".\n\n==Biography==\nFrancisco Gomez is a native of [[Deming, New Mexico]]. His parents divorced when he was four years old, and he lived with his mother in [[Laredo, Texas|Laredo]] and [[San Antonio, Texas]]. He then moved to [[Columbus, New Mexico]] with his father. It was through his moving that he began listening to not only [[country music]], but also ''[[ranchera]]'' music. As he is of Hispanic descent, he thought that he would \"stand out\" as a country musician, citing other Hispanic artists such as [[Freddy Fender]] as inspiration on this front.<ref name=\"lcs\"/>\n\nFrom 2007 to 2017, Gomez worked as a [[police officer]] in [[Las Cruces, New Mexico]]. After having success with performances on weekends and gaining regional commercial success with songs on the Texas country charts, he retired from the police force and began singing full-time. He released an EP titled ''Different Kind of Country'' in 2018 under his performing name of Frank Ray. In addition, he became an opening act for [[Ashley McBryde]].<ref name=\"lcs\">{{cite web | url=https://www.lcsun-news.com/story/news/2019/01/06/movers-shakers-2019-frank-ray-borderland-musician-cop-country-music/2407500002/ | title=Movers and Shakers 2019: Frank Ray sings for the borderland | work=Las Cruces Sun News | date=January 6, 2019 | access-date=January 26, 2022}}</ref>\n\nIn 2021, Ray signed with [[BBR Music Group]] and released the song \"Streetlights\". The song features Ray singing in both English and Spanish. Ray was contacted by BBR staff after one of them discovered a previous song of his, \"Tequila Mockingbird\", on a [[Spotify]] playlist.<ref name=\"cmt\"/> Later in the year he issued his debut single, \"Country'd Look Good on You\". This was followed in January 2022 by his first performance on the [[Grand Ole Opry]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://people.com/country/frank-ray-reflects-on-grand-ole-opry-debut-incredible/ | title=Frank Ray Crosses Another Dream Off His Country Checklist as He Debuts at the Grand Ole Opry: 'Incredible' | work=People | date=January 14, 2022 | access-date=January 26, 2022}}</ref> The same month, \"Country'd Look Good on You\" entered the top 40 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Country Airplay]] charts,<ref name=\"bcu\">{{cite web | url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/bulletins.billboard.com/country/country_update_2022_0124.pdf | title=Billboard Country Update | publisher=Billboard | date=January 24, 2022 | access-date=January 26, 2022}}</ref> and went on to peak in the top 20 of the chart in September.\n\n==Discography==\n===Singles===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ List of singles, with selected chart positions\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Year\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:14em;\"| Title\n! colspan=\"2\"| Peak positions\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Album\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n! style=\"width:45px;\"| [[Hot Country Songs|US<br />Country<br />Songs]]<br /><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/frank-ray/chart-history/csi/|title=Frank Ray Chart History: Hot Country Songs|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=June 22, 2022}}</ref>\n! style=\"width:45px;\"| [[Country Airplay|US Country Airplay]]<br /><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/frank-ray/chart-history/csa/|title=Frank Ray Chart History: Country Airplay|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=September 9, 2023}}</ref>\n|-\n| 2021\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Country'd Look Good on You\"\n| 46 || 17\n| rowspan=\"3\" {{tba}}\n|-\n| 2023\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Somebody Else's Whiskey\"\n| — || 48\n|-\n|2024\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Uh-Huh (Ajá)\"\n|—\n|—\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ray, Frank}}\n[[Category:American male singers]]\n[[Category:American country singers]]\n[[Category:BBR Music Group artists]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:People from Luna County, New Mexico]]\n[[Category:1987 births]]"
