Between 1995 and 1997, he and Kelly Shiver comprised the duo [[Thrasher Shiver]], which recorded a studio album for [[Asylum Records]] in 1996 and charted two singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country charts in early 1997. \n\nAlthough Thrasher Shiver has not been active since 1997, Thrasher has written several singles for other country music artists, such as [[Jason Aldean]], [[Rascal Flatts]], [[Kenny Chesney]], [[Diamond Rio]], and [[Montgomery Gentry]]. Thrasher has also received an [[ASCAP]] Songwriter of the Year award in 2004.\n\n== Biography ==\nNeil Thrasher was born in 1965 in [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], Alabama. His father was a member of a gospel music band known as the Thrasher Brothers.<ref name=\"gac\" /> The Thrasher Brothers were inducted into the Alabama music Hall of fame in 2005.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.alamhof.org/thrasherbrothers|title = Biography}}</ref>\n\nAlthough he had originally planned to play college football, he later switched his focus to singing and songwriting.<ref name=\"gac\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gactv.com/gac/nw_cma_close_up/article/0,,GAC_26068_5147071,00.html |title=News: CMA Close UP : Neil Thrasher's Continuing Education |access-date=December 7, 2007 |last=Doerschuk |first=Robert L. |date=November 1, 2006|work=[[Great American Country|GAC.com]]}}</ref> In 1992 he met his future wife, Lana, who was running Major Bob Music publishing company that also managed [[Garth Brooks]]. Thrasher sang backing vocals on Brooks' 1990 album ''[[No Fences]]'' and wrote a single for [[Ricky Lynn Gregg]] in 1994. Eventually, the company's owner, Bob Doyle, introduced Thrasher to another singer-songwriter named Kelly Shiver. The two soon formed the duo [[Thrasher Shiver]], which released one album in 1996 on [[Asylum Records]]. In addition, Thrasher co-wrote [[Diamond Rio]]'s 1996 single \"That's What I Get for Lovin' You\" and [[Rhett Akins]]' 1997 single \"Better Than It Used to Be\".\n\nAlthough Thrasher Shiver split up in 1997, both members continued to write songs, with Thrasher being the more prolific of the two. In 1999, [[Reba McEntire]] released \"What Do You Say\", one of Thrasher's compositions. The song reached Top 5 on the ''Billboard'' country music charts. Thrasher had minor success as a songwriter throughout the early 2000s, including low-charting singles for [[3 of Hearts (band)|3 of Hearts]] and [[Meredith Edwards (singer)|Meredith Edwards]], as well as [[Kenny Chesney]]'s \"[[I Lost It]]\" and [[Jeff Carson]]'s \"[[Real Life (I Never Was the Same Again)]].\"<ref name=\"bob\" />\n\nThrasher became more prolific in the mid-2000s, with [[Rascal Flatts]] releasing four of his songs as singles, including the Number One hits \"[[Fast Cars and Freedom]]\" and \"[[Take Me There (Rascal Flatts song)|Take Me There]]\". The latter was co-written by Chesney, who also topped the country charts in late 2003-early 2004 with \"[[There Goes My Life]]\", another Thrasher co-write.<ref name=\"gac\" /><ref name=\"bob\">{{cite web |url=http://www.majorbob.com/writers/current/thrasher.htm |title=Major Bob Music > Catalog Writers : Neil Thrasher |access-date=December 7, 2007 |work=MajorBob.com |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071126080740/http://www.majorbob.com/writers/current/thrasher.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = November 26, 2007}}</ref>\n\n== List of singles composed by Neil Thrasher ==\n{{inc-musong|date=October 2021}}\n*[[3 of Hearts (band)|3 of Hearts]] – \"Love Is Enough\"\n*[[Rhett Akins]] – \"Better Than It Used to Be\"\n*[[Jason Aldean]] – \"[[Tattoos on This Town]]\", \"[[Fly Over States]]\", \"[[Night Train (Jason Aldean song)|Night Train]]\", \"[[Rearview Town (song)|Rearview Town]]\", \"[[Try That in a Small Town]]\"\n*[[Bryan Austin]] – \"Is It Just Me\"\n*[[Lee Brice]] – \"She Ain't Right\"\n*[[Chris Cagle]] – \"Never Ever Gone\"\n*[[Jeff Carson]] – \"[[Real Life (I Never Was the Same Again)]]\"\n*[[Kenny Chesney]] – \"[[I Lost It]],\" \"[[There Goes My Life]]\"\n*[[Kristy Lee Cook]] – \"Wherever Love Goes\"\n*[[Billy Ray Cyrus]] – \"[[Somebody Said a Prayer]]\"\n*[[Diamond Rio]] – \"[[That's What I Get for Lovin' You]],\" \"[[Sweet Summer]],\" \"[[Wrinkles (song)|Wrinkles]]\"\n*[[Ronnie Dunn]] – \"Ain't No Trucks in Texas\"\n*[[Meredith Edwards (singer)|Meredith Edwards]] – \"The Bird Song\"\n*[[Rascal Flatts]] – \"[[I Melt]],\" \"[[Fast Cars and Freedom]],\" \"[[Take Me There (Rascal Flatts song)|Take Me There]],\" \"[[Bob That Head]],\" \"[[Why Wait (song)|Why Wait]]\", \"[[Banjo (song)|Banjo]]\", \"[[Changed (Rascal Flatts song)|Changed]]\"\n*[[Ricky Lynn Gregg]] – \"Get a Little Closer\"\n*[[Andy Griggs]] – \"How Cool Is That,\" \"This I Gotta See\"\n*[[Randy Houser]] – \"[[How Country Feels (song)|How Country Feels]]\", \"Wherever Love Goes\"\n*[[Jackie Lee (country singer)|Jackie Lee]] – \"She Does\"\n*[[Brice Long]] – \"It's Only Monday\"\n*[[Reba McEntire]] – \"[[What Do You Say (Reba McEntire song)|What Do You Say]]\",\" \"[[Strange (Reba McEntire song)|Strange]]\"\n*[[Montgomery Gentry]] – \"[[Some People Change (song)|Some People Change]]\"\n*[[Marty Raybon]] – \"Cracker Jack Diamond\"\n*[[Collin Raye]] – \"Quitters\"\n*[[Thrasher Shiver]] – \"Going Going Gone\"\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Thrasher, Neil}}\n[[Category:1963 births]]\n[[Category:Middle Tennessee State University alumni]]\n[[Category:American country singer-songwriters]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Country musicians from Alabama]]\n[[Category:Singer-songwriters from Alabama]]"
