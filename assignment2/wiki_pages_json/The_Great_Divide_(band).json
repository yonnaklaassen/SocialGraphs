The Great Divide formed its own [[record label]], publishing company and operating company, and began recording. The group's first two albums, ''Goin' For Broke'' and ''Break In The Storm'', were independent releases. [[Atlantic Records]] signed the group and re-released ''Break In The Storm'' as well as the band's third album, ''Revolutions''. ''Remain'', the group's fifth album, was released independently at the end of 2002.\n\nThe Great Divide originally consisted of bassist Kelley Green, singer-songwriter [[Mike McClure]] and brothers Scott and J.J. Lester (rhythm guitar and drums, respectively). McClure left the band in early 2003 to pursue a career highlighting his originals and helping other bands record albums. The band continued with new singer Micah Aills but broke up after the release of \"Under Your Own Sun\" in 2005.<ref>{{cite news|first= Chip |last= Chandler |title= Great Divide makes amends, joins for reunion shows |date= February 8, 2012 |access-date= June 14, 2022 |url= \nhttps://www.amarillo.com/story/entertainment/local/2012/02/08/divide-makes-amends-joins-reunion-shows/13135190007/}}</ref>\n\nOn August 26, 2011, the original members reunited for an appearance and are still together today touring.<ref>{{cite news|first= Laurie |last= James |title= Bridging the Great Divide Seminal Red Dirt band reunites for Stillwater show |date= September 1, 2011 |access-date= June 14, 2022 |url= \nhttps://lonestarmusicmagazine.com/bridging-the-great-divide/}}</ref> The album \"25 Years of the Great Divide\", comprising 31 tracks, was released to celebrate their 25th anniversary in 2018.
