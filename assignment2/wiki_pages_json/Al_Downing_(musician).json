He compiled a list of his own songs, which he presented to his producer at Warner Brothers. In 1978, \"Mr. Jones\" reached the Top 20, followed by \"Touch Me (I'll Be Your Fool Once More)\" in 1979. That same year, Downing produced \"Midnight Lace,\" which reached the 50s on the charts, and \"I Ain't No Fool,\" which peaked at the upper 70s. In 1980, the \"Story Behind The Story\" reached the Top 40 and \"Bring It On Home\" reached the Top 20.\n\nTwo years passed before Downing created another hit, this time with the Team label. In 1982, \"I'll Be Loving You\" reached the Top 50, followed by \"Darlene,\" which reached the lower 60s. The next year, \"It Takes Love\" reached the Top 40, followed by \"Let's Sing About Love,\" which peaked in the mid-60s. In 1984, \"The Best Of Families\" became a Top 50 hit; That same year, Downing released his final hit with the Team label, \"There’ll Never Be A Better Night For Being Wrong\".\n\n===Vine Street years===\nIn 1987, Downing was signed by the [[Vine Street]] label, which released the \"Oh How Beautiful You Are\" (To Me) and \"Just One Night Won't Do,\" both of which hit the Top 70. Two years later, he was signed by Door Knob Records, with whom he produced the 1989 Top 100 hit, \"I Guess By Now.\"\n\nThe popular entertainer [[Fats Domino]] recorded two songs written by Downing: \"Mary, Oh Mary\" and \"Heartbreak Hill\". [[Bobby Bland|Bobby \"Blue\" Bland]] and [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]] have also recorded Downing's songs.\n\n===Later career===\nDowning built a five-decade career around his powerful singing voice and his hard-driving rockabilly-style piano. Downing's compilations of earlier work have been released throughout the world. In Europe, Crazy Music obtained exclusive rights for the original Team label recordings and released these in the form of a 2-CD compilation, ''Classic Collection''. This also contained some of Downing's earlier hits, including \"Mr. Jones.\"\n\nIn July 2002, he played the Oneida Casino's Rock'n'Roll Festival in [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]] with dozens of other rockabilly musicians.\n\nIn 2003, Downing released his first new album in more than a decade, ''One of A Kind''.

He was hospitalized and diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic [[leukemia]]. Soon after, he commenced [[chemotherapy]] treatment. Downing died on July 4, 2005.\n\n==Style==\nDowning's musical style found its roots in a variety of musical styles including [[rock and roll]], [[blues]], roots, [[gospel music|gospel]] and [[country music|country]]. He performed [[rhythm and blues]] and [[disco]] throughout the 1960s and 1970s, when he lived in [[Washington, D.C.]]  He eventually reclaimed his musical roots by turning to country music.\n\n== Producer ==\nIn additional to his work as a recording artist and performer, Downing also worked as a music producer.

In 2003, he produced the album, ''Straight Beat'', with the Italian bluesman Edo 'Ndoss, which included songs written by Downing that he had not recorded himself.
