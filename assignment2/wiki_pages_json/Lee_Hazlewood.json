When recording \"These Boots are Made for Walkin'\", Hazlewood suggested to Nancy Sinatra, \"you can't sing like Nancy Nice Lady any more. You have to sing for the truckers\". She later described him as \"part [[Pygmalion (play)|Henry Higgins]] and part [[Sigmund Freud]]\".<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\nHazlewood also wrote \"How Does That Grab Ya, Darlin'\", \"Friday's Child\", \"So Long, Babe\", \"[[Sugar Town]]\" and many others for Sinatra.<ref name=\"age\">{{cite news |title=Requiem for a pop hit master |url=https://www.theage.com.au/entertainment/music/requiem-for-a-pop-hit-master-20070129-ge43e1.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1 |access-date=17 March 2020 |work=The Age |date=2007-01-29}}</ref><ref name=\"bbcdies\" /> Among his most well-known vocal performances is \"[[Some Velvet Morning]]\", a 1967 duet with Sinatra. He performed that song along with \"[[Jackson (song)|Jackson]]\" on her 1967 television special ''[[Movin' With Nancy]]''. Early in 1967, Lee produced the number 1 hit song for Frank and Nancy Sinatra \"[[Somethin' Stupid]]\". The pair became the only father-daughter duo to top the Hot 100.{{citation needed|date=May 2022}} The record earned a [[Grammy Award]] nomination for [[Record of the Year]] and remains the only father-daughter duet to hit No. 1 in the U.S.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6531810/rewinding-the-charts-in-1967-frank-nancy-sinatra-shared-a-no-1|title=Rewinding the Charts: In 1967, Frank & Nancy Sinatra Shared a No. 1|website=Billboard.com|access-date=August 7, 2021}}</ref>\n\nHazlewood wrote the theme song \"The Last of the Secret Agents\", the theme song of the [[The Last of the Secret Agents?|1966 spy-spoof film of the same title]]. Nancy Sinatra, who had a role in the film, recorded the song for the soundtrack. For [[Frank Sinatra]]'s 1967 detective film, ''[[Tony Rome]]'', Hazlewood wrote the theme song which was performed by Nancy.\n\nHe wrote \"[[Houston (song)|Houston]]\", a 1965 US hit recorded by [[Dean Martin]]. He produced several singles for Martin's daughter, [[Deana Martin]], including her country hit, \"Girl of the Month Club\", while Deana was a teenager. Other tunes on that project were \"When He Remembers Me\", \"Baby I See You\" and \"The Bottom of My Mind\", all recorded during the 1960s.\n\nHazlewood wrote \"[[This Town (Frank Sinatra song)|This Town]]\", a song that was recorded by Frank Sinatra that appeared on his 1968 album ''[[Frank Sinatra's Greatest Hits|Greatest Hits]]'' and is the basis for [[Paul Shaffer]]'s \"Small Town News\" segment theme on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]''.\n\nIn 1967, Hazlewood started his own record label, [[LHI Records]] (Lee Hazlewood Industries). Though it did not receive much attention at the time, the [[International Submarine Band]], led by a then-unknown [[Gram Parsons]], signed with LHI in 1967 and released their one and only album, ''[[Safe at Home]]''. Shortly after the album was recorded, Parsons left the band to join [[The Byrds]], contributing several songs to their 1968 album ''[[Sweetheart of the Rodeo]]''. The contract Parsons had signed with Hazlewood's LHI caused a great deal of trouble for himself and The Byrds, and in the court settlement most of Parsons' material on ''Sweetheart of the Rodeo'' had the vocals removed and re-recorded by [[Roger McGuinn]]. This situation led to Parsons' departure from the Byrds not long after the album's release.{{cn|date=October 2023}}\n\nAs LHI producer and Hazlewood's ex-girlfriend Suzi Jane Hokom later noted, Hazlewood was a performer and not a businessman, and his lack of business acumen figured greatly in the label's 1971 demise. He had a supporting role in the movie ''[[The Moonshine War]]'', released in 1970 from a story by [[Elmore Leonard]], starring [[Patrick McGoohan]], [[Richard Widmark]], [[Alan Alda]] and [[Will Geer]].\n\nIn the 1970s, Hazlewood moved to [[Stockholm]], where he wrote and produced the one-hour television show ''Cowboy in Sweden'' together with friend and director [[Torbjörn Axelman]], which also later emerged as an album.<ref>{{cite web | first = Spencer | last = Leigh | title = Lee Hazlewood Obituary | work = [[The Independent]] | date = August 6, 2007 | url = http://news.independent.co.uk/people/obituaries/article2838621.ece | access-date = 2007-08-11 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070825061337/http://news.independent.co.uk/people/obituaries/article2838621.ece | archive-date = August 25, 2007 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nDuring ten years in [[Sweden]], he made records and films with Axelman. According to a retrospective of his career, the move to Europe was motivated by his \"tax problems\", concern that his son might be drafted for the [[Vietnam War]] and the fact that his record label \"LHI was dying anyway\", so Sweden looked like the perfect escape route. Decades later, his friend Suzi Jane Hokom made this comment about the years in Europe. \"I think he knew he'd burned his bridges in LA and here was a brand new world where he had a built-in fanclub ... He really needed a new start\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/nov/28/lee-hazlewood-guru-cowboy-psychedelia|title=Lee Hazlewood: the wayward guru of cowboy psychedelia|date=November 28, 2013|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=August 7, 2021}}</ref>\n\nThroughout the late 1970s and 1980s, Hazlewood was [[semi-retired]] from the music business.
