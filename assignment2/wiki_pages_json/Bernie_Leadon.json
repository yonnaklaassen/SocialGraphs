Prior to the Eagles, he was a member of three country rock bands: [[Hearts & Flowers]], [[Dillard & Clark]], and [[the Flying Burrito Brothers]]. He is a multi-instrumentalist ([[guitar]], [[banjo]], [[mandolin]], [[steel guitar]], [[dobro]]) coming from a [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] background. He introduced elements of this music to a mainstream audience during his tenure with the Eagles.\n\nLeadon's music career since leaving the Eagles has been low-key, resulting in two solo albums (the first actually being a collaborative project with Michael Georgiades) with a gap of 27 years in between. Leadon has also appeared on many other artists' records as a session musician.\n\n==Early life and musical beginnings==\n<!--Leadon was born in Minneapolis, one of ten siblings, to Bernard Leadon Jr. and Ann Teresa (née Sweetser) Leadon, devout [[Roman Catholic]]s. His father was an aerospace engineer and nuclear physicist whose career moved the family around the U.S. The family enjoyed music and, at an early age, Bernie developed an interest in folk and bluegrass music. He eventually mastered the 5-string banjo, mandolin and acoustic guitar.\n-->\n<!--As a young teen he moved with his family to San Diego, California, where he-->In San Diego, California, Leadon met fellow musicians Ed Douglas and Larry Murray of the local bluegrass outfit [[the Scottsville Squirrel Barkers]]. The Barkers proved a breeding ground for future California country rock talent, including shy, 18-year-old mandolin player [[Chris Hillman]], with whom Leadon maintained a lifelong friendship. Augmented by banjo player (and future Flying Burrito Brother) Kenny Wertz, the Squirrel Barkers eventually asked Leadon to join the group, upon Wertz's joining the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] in 1963.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n<!--His stint in the Scottsville Squirrel Barkers did not last long. In late 1963, his family relocated to [[Gainesville, Florida]], when his father accepted a position as Professor of [[Aerospace Engineering]] at the [[University of Florida]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Leadon attended [[Gainesville High School (Florida)|Gainesville High School]], where-->He later met <!--classmate and--> future Eagles lead guitarist [[Don Felder]], whose band, the Continentals, had just lost guitarist [[Stephen Stills]]. <!--Upon Leadon's joining the group, rechristened Maundy Quintet, they gigged locally, even sharing the bill with future Gainesville legend [[Tom Petty]] and his early band the Epics (a band that also included Bernie's brother, musician [[Tom Leadon]]).{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}-->\n\nA call from ex-Squirrel Barker Larry Murray in 1967 to join his fledgling psychedelic country-folk group Hearts & Flowers brought Leadon to California, where he became involved with the burgeoning L.A. folk/country rock scene. Leadon recorded one album with the band, its second release, ''Of Horses, Kids, and Forgotten Women'', for [[Capitol Records]]. The record was a local hit but failed to make much of a dent on the national album charts. Discouraged, the group disbanded the following year.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n===Dillard & Clark===\nBy late 1968, Leadon had befriended bluegrass/banjo legend [[Doug Dillard]], late of [[the Dillards]]. While staying with Dillard, informal jam sessions with songwriter and ex-[[Byrds]] member [[Gene Clark]] began to take shape, and morphed into what eventually became the country-rock band Dillard & Clark. In 1968, the group recorded ''[[The Fantastic Expedition of Dillard & Clark]]'', featuring Leadon's backing vocals and multi-instrumental work. The album included several compositions co-written with Clark, most notably the future Eagles staple (and somewhat of a signature song for Leadon) from their debut album, \"Train Leaves Here This Morning\".\n\n===The Flying Burrito Brothers===\n[[File:FlyingBurritos1970.jpg|thumb|Flying Burrito Brothers (Amsterdam, 1970). From left to right: [[Sneaky Pete Kleinow]], [[Rick Roberts (musician)|Rick Roberts]], [[Chris Hillman]], [[Michael Clarke (musician)|Michael Clarke]], Bernie Leadon]]\nLeadon left Dillard & Clark in 1969, eventually reconnecting with ex-Squirrel Barker (and ex-Byrd) Chris Hillman, who asked him to join the Flying Burrito Brothers, a fledgling country-rock band that Hillman had formed a year earlier with fellow ex-Byrd [[Gram Parsons]]. Leadon recorded two albums with the group: ''[[Burrito Deluxe]]'' and the post-Parsons LP [[The Flying Burrito Bros (album)|''The Flying Burrito Bros'']].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} After the latter album's release in 1971, Leadon had tired of the band's lack of commercial success and decided to leave the band to pursue an opportunity to play with three musicians he had worked with while moonlighting in [[Linda Ronstadt]]'s backing band that summer, forming the Eagles.\n\n==Eagles==\n\nLeadon was the last original member to join the Eagles,{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} a band initially formed by guitarist/singer [[Glenn Frey]], drummer/singer [[Don Henley]], and former [[Poco (band)|Poco]] bassist/singer [[Randy Meisner]]. Leadon is often credited with helping shape the band's early country-rock sound, bringing his strong sense of harmony as well as his country, bluegrass and acoustic sensibilities to the group. Instruments he played during his tenure in the band were [[electric guitar]], [[B-Bender]], [[acoustic guitar]], [[banjo]], [[mandolin]], [[dobro]] and [[pedal steel guitar]].\n\nUpon the release of their debut album, [[Eagles (album)|''Eagles'']], the group met with near instant success, due largely to the strength of their hit singles \"[[Take It Easy]]\", \"[[Peaceful Easy Feeling]]\" and \"[[Witchy Woman]]\" (co-written by Leadon and Henley), all of which highlighted Leadon's multi-instrumental talent and harmony vocals. Their follow-up, [[Desperado (Eagles album)|''Desperado'']], was another strong country-rock venture highlighted by the classics \"[[Tequila Sunrise (Eagles song)|Tequila Sunrise]]\" and the [[Desperado (Eagles song)|title track]]. Leadon had a prominent role on the album but it was met by surprisingly lukewarm reviews and lackluster sales. As a result, the band attempted to distance itself from the \"[[country rock]]\" label for their third album ''[[On the Border]]''. In doing so, Leadon encouraged the group to recruit his old friend, guitarist [[Don Felder]], to the band. The result was the guitar-heavy top 40 hit \"[[Already Gone (Eagles song)|Already Gone]]\". The album also included \"My Man\", Leadon's touching tribute to his old bandmate and friend [[Gram Parsons]], who had died of a drug overdose the year prior at [[Joshua Tree National Park|Joshua Tree National Monument]] in southeastern California.\n\nWith the wild success of ''[[On the Border]]'' and its follow-up smash, ''[[One of These Nights]]'', tension within the band grew with some sources saying Leadon grew increasingly frustrated by the band's direction away from his beloved country and bluegrass toward album-oriented stadium rock. He famously quit the band in 1975 by pouring a beer over Glenn Frey's head.<ref>Eliot, Marc (2005). [https://books.google.com/books?id=o_EjE6-iyQoC ''To the Limit: The Untold Story of the Eagles'']{{Dead link|date=October 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, p. 131. Da Capo Press.</ref> He later cited a need to get healthy and break the vicious cycle of touring, recording and heavy drug use that was rampant within the band.\n\nUpon Leadon's departure, [[Asylum Records]] released ''[[Their Greatest Hits (1971–1975)]]'', which highlighted the band's Leadon years and went on to become the best-selling album in United States history, with sales in excess of 38 million units. He was replaced by former [[James Gang]] guitarist and singer [[Joe Walsh]].\n\nAlthough it has long been believed that he left because he was dissatisfied with the band moving into rock and roll, Leadon denies it and said in 2013, \"That's an oversimplification, it implies that I had no interest in rock or blues or anything but country rock. That's just not the case. I didn't just play [[Fender Telecaster]]. I played a [[Gibson Les Paul]] and I enjoyed [[rock & roll]]. That's evident from the early albums.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Greene |first=Andy |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/eagles-tour-will-feature-founding-guitarist-bernie-leadon-20130705 |title=Eagles Tour: Guitarist Bernie Leadon Will Reunite |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=July 5, 2013 |access-date=March 4, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Later career==\n[[File:Eagles in concert September 2014.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|History of the Eagles tour, 2014. Leadon (second from left) joined the tour.]]\nUpon leaving the Eagles, Leadon retreated from the limelight, only to resurface in 1977 with musician friend Michael Georgiades for the album, ''Natural Progressions'' (credited to \"The Bernie Leadon-Michael Georgiades Band\"), featuring Leadon and Georgiades on guitars and alternating lead vocals, along with Bryan Garofalo on bass, Dave Kemper on drums, and Steve Goldstein on keyboard.\n\nIn 1985, he recorded an album of bluegrass and gospel favorites under the name Ever Call Ready, featuring Chris Hillman and [[Al Perkins]]. He also had a short stint with the [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]] in the late 1980s.\n\nIn 1993, he became a member of [[Run C&W]], a novelty group singing Motown hits \"bluegrass style\", recording two albums for [[MCA Records]].\n\nIn 1998, Leadon reunited with the Eagles in New York City for the band's induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. All seven current and former Eagles members performed together on \"Take It Easy\" and \"[[Hotel California]]\".\n\nIn 2004, he released his second solo effort in 27 years (and his first under solely his name), ''Mirror''.\n\nLeadon toured with the Eagles from 2013 through 2015 during their [[History of the Eagles – Live in Concert|History of the Eagles Tour]]<ref name=\"Miami\">{{cite web|url=http://www.miami.com/review-eagles-bring-40-year-history-tour-and-taste-california-miami-s-americanairlines-arena-article|title=Review: Eagles bring 40-year 'History' Tour and taste of California to Miami's AmericanAirlines Arena|first=Howard|last=Cohen|work=[[Miami.com]]|date=November 23, 2013|access-date=January 21, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/music/ci_25025439/review-eagles-fly-through-history-lesson|title=Review: Eagles fly through history lesson|first=Jim|last=Harrington|work=[[San Jose Mercury News]]|date=January 30, 2014|access-date=January 21, 2016}}</ref> In 2015, Leadon appeared on producer [[Ethan Johns]]' third solo album, ''[[Silver Liner]]''.\n\nIn February 2016, Leadon appeared at the [[Grammy Awards]] ceremony with [[Jackson Browne]] and the surviving Eagles members - Don Henley, Joe Walsh, and [[Timothy B.
