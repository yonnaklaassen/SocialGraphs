Horton's eponymous debut album was released by [[Capitol Records|Capitol Nashville]] in 1989. Its first single, \"Roll Over\", was his only song to enter the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs|Hot Country Singles & Tracks]] chart, peaking at No.&nbsp;68 in 1989. A second single, \"Tennessee Plates,\" peaked at No.&nbsp;80 on the ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' Country Tracks chart in Canada.\n\n==Biography==\nSteven Wayne Horton was born in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. He took musical inspiration from [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] and [[Elvis Presley]], and began playing guitar in fourth grade. In his preteen years, he formed a band that performed cover versions of [[rockabilly]] songs.<ref name=\"cash\"/> At a showing of the 1989 Jerry Lee Lewis biopic ''[[Great Balls of Fire! (film)|Great Balls of Fire!]]'' in Memphis, Horton performed a special 45-minute set with Lewis. That same year, he signed with [[Capitol Records]] Nashville and released his self-titled debut album.<ref name=\"cash\">{{cite journal | url=https://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-All-Music/Cash-Box/80s/1989/CB-1989-09-02.pdf | title=STEVEN WAYNE HORTON:Bringin' Back the Memphis Sound | author=Kay Knight | journal=[[Cash Box (magazine)|Cash Box]] | pages=24 | date=September 2, 1989}}</ref> The album was produced by Jack Holder, a Memphis-based guitarist who has also worked with [[Tracy Chapman]].<ref>{{cite magazine | url=https://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-All-Music/Billboard/80s/1989/BB-1989-08-26.pdf | title=New on the charts | author=Jim Richliano | magazine=Billboard | date=August 26, 1989}}</ref> Wayne Blesdoe of the ''[[Knoxville News-Sentinel]]'' gave the album a mixed review. He called it \"well produced and fun\" for its rockabilly influences, but considered it \"old news\" for the same reason due to the rise of artists whom he considered stylistically similar such as [[Marty Stuart]] and [[Steve Earle]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/775157772/ | title=Ronstadt returns to pop glory on 'Cry Like a Rainstorm' | work=Knoxville News-Sentinel | date=November 26, 1989 | accessdate=May 8, 2022 | author=Wayne Bledsoe | pages=8, 9}}</ref>\n\nTwo singles were released from the album.
