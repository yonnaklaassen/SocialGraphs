Turnout for the audition was small; only three people showed up, but three was enough.  Gabe Guevara, Hayden McMullen and Chris Flores were immediately dubbed \"the Moonshine Band.\"  After their first show at a local honky-tonk, JB and the boys began touring, and with a jury-rigged PA system and a rented U-Haul van, the band travelled through East Texas, quickly gaining a local following.<ref name=\"jbandthemoonshineband.com\">{{cite web |url=http://jbandthemoonshineband.com/about |title=About |access-date=2012-08-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625163630/http://www.jbandthemoonshineband.com/about |archive-date=2012-06-25 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe group’s big break came while opening for [[Average Joe's Entertainment]] artist [[Colt Ford]] in March 2010.
