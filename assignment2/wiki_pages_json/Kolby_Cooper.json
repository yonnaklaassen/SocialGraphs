Active since 2019, he has released two [[extended play]]s and charted one single through Combustion Music.\n\n==Biography==\nKolby Cooper was born in [[Bradford, Texas]]. He grew up listening to both [[outlaw country]] and [[grunge]], both of which inspired him to learn to play guitar and write songs. Although he initially wanted to be a football player, a high school classmate persuaded him to focus on music instead.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.tennessean.com/story/entertainment/2022/08/19/kolby-cooper-boy-anderson-county-moon-talks-new-album/10284329002/ | title=Kolby Cooper rides a country music silver lining 'From Anderson County to the Moon' | publisher=The Tennessean | date=August 19, 2022 | accessdate=April 10, 2023}}</ref>\n\nBy the time he finished high school, Cooper was married and had begun writing songs full-time. After entering some of his songs in local talent competitions, he released his debut single \"Every Single Kiss\" in 2017 followed by an [[extended play]] a year later. He continued to release songs through Combustion Music throughout the 2010s.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/kolby-cooper-mn0003961524/biography | title=Kolby Cooper biography | publisher=AllMusic | accessdate=April 10, 2023}}</ref>\n\nBy 2022, Cooper was signed to [[BBR Music Group]]'s Wheelhouse imprint, which sent the single \"Excuses\" to radio late in the year.
