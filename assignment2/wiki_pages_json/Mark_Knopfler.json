The recording included Knopfler (guitar and vocals), Steve Phillips (second guitar), Dave Johnson (bass), and Paul Granger (percussion). Johnson, Granger, and vocalist Mick Dewhirst played with Knopfler in a band called Silverheels; Phillips was later to rejoin Knopfler in the short lived side exercise from Dire Straits, [[The Notting Hillbillies]].\n\nUpon graduation in 1973, Knopfler moved to London and joined a band based in [[High Wycombe]] called [[Brewers Droop]].  This group had issued studio-recorded material before Knopfler joined, and went into the studio while Knopfler was a member -- but Brewer's Droop material with Knopfler remained unissued until appearing on their 1989 archival album ''[[The Booze Brothers]]''.<ref>{{cite web |author=Steve Huey |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-booze-brothers-mw0000205981 |title=The Booze Brothers – Brewers Droop |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=18 September 2018 |archive-date=14 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180914022902/https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-booze-brothers-mw0000205981 |url-status=live }}</ref> \n\nOne night, while spending time with friends, the only guitar available was an old acoustic with a badly warped neck that had been strung with extra-light strings to make it usable. Even so, he found it impossible to play unless he finger-picked it, leading to the development of his signature playing style. He said in a later interview, \"That was where I found my 'voice' on guitar.\" After a brief stint with Brewers Droop, Knopfler took a job as a lecturer at [[Epping Forest College|Loughton College]] in Essex – a position he held for three years. Throughout this time, he continued performing with local [[pub]] bands, including the Café Racers.{{citation needed|date=August 2023}}\n\nBy the mid-1970s, Knopfler devoted much of his musical energies to his group, the Café Racers. His brother David moved to London, where he shared a flat with [[John Illsley]], a guitarist who changed over to playing bass guitar. In April 1977, Mark moved out of his flat in [[Buckhurst Hill]] and moved in with David and John. The three began playing music together, and soon Mark invited John to join the Café Racers.<ref>{{cite web |last=Kilburn |first=Terry |title=Mark Knopfler Biography |url=http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/mark-knopfler-biography/a890958919ee74784825688c00135994 |access-date=12 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929011638/http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/Mark-Knopfler-Biography/A890958919EE74784825688C00135994 |archive-date=29 September 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===1977–1995: Dire Straits===\n{{Main|Dire Straits}}\n[[File:Mark Knopfler - 1979.jpg|thumb|upright|Knopfler with [[Dire Straits]], 1979]]\nDire Straits' first demos were recorded in three sessions in 1977, with [[David Knopfler]] as rhythm guitarist, [[John Illsley]] as bass guitarist, and [[Pick Withers]] as drummer. On 27 July 1977, they recorded the demo tapes of five songs: \"Wild West End\", \"[[Sultans of Swing]]\", \"Down to the Waterline\", \"Sacred Loving\" (a David Knopfler song), and \"Water of Love\". They later recorded \"Southbound Again\", \"In the Gallery\", and \"Six Blade Knife\" for [[BBC Radio London]]—and, finally, on 9 November, made demo tapes of \"[[Setting Me Up]]\", \"Eastbound Train\", and \"Real Girl\". Many of these songs reflect Knopfler's experiences in Newcastle, Leeds, and London, and were featured on their first album, the eponymous ''[[Dire Straits (album)|Dire Straits]],'' which was released in the following year: \"Down to the Waterline\" recalled images of life in Newcastle; \"In The Gallery\" is a tribute to a Leeds sculptor and artist named Harry Phillips (father of [[Steve Phillips (musician)|Steve Phillips]]); and \"Lions\", \"Wild West End\", and \"Eastbound Train\" were all drawn from Knopfler's early days in the capital.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nOn its initial release in October 1978, the album ''Dire Straits'' received little fanfare in the UK, but when \"Sultans of Swing\" was released as a single, it became a chart hit in the Netherlands and album sales took off – first across Europe, and then in the United States and Canada, and finally the UK. The group's second album, ''[[Communiqué (Dire Straits album)|Communiqué]],'' produced by [[Jerry Wexler]] and [[Barry Beckett]], followed in June 1979.\n\nTheir third album, ''[[Making Movies]]'', released in October 1980, moved towards more complex arrangements and production, which continued for the remainder of the group's career. The album included many of Mark Knopfler's most personal compositions, most notably \"[[Romeo and Juliet (Dire Straits song)|Romeo and Juliet]]\" and \"[[Tunnel of Love (Dire Straits song)|Tunnel of Love]]\", with its intro \"The Carousel Waltz\" by [[Richard Rodgers]] and [[Oscar Hammerstein II]], which also featured in the 1982 [[Richard Gere]] film ''[[An Officer and a Gentleman]]''. There were frequent personnel changes within Dire Straits from 1980 onwards, with Mark Knopfler and John Illsley the only members to remain throughout the group's 18-year existence. In 1980 whilst the recording sessions for ''Making Movies'' were taking place, tensions between the Knopfler brothers reached a point where David Knopfler decided to leave the band for a solo career.<ref>{{cite web |last= Genzel |first= Christian |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/p18708 |title=David Knopfler |publisher= AllMusic |access-date= 17 April 2011}}</ref> The remaining trio continued the album, with [[Roy Bittan]] from [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s [[E Street Band]] guesting on keyboards and session guitarist [[Sid McGinnis]] on rhythm guitar, although he was uncredited on the album. After the recording sessions were completed, keyboardist [[Alan Clark (keyboardist)|Alan Clark]] and Californian guitarist [[Hal Lindes]] joined Dire Straits as full-time members for the ''On Location'' tour of Europe, North America, and Oceania.<ref name=\"sing365\"/>\n\nIn September 1982, the group's fourth studio album ''[[Love Over Gold]]'' was released. This featured the tracks \"[[Private Investigations (song)|Private Investigations]]\", \"[[Telegraph Road (song)|Telegraph Road]]\", \"[[Industrial Disease (song)|Industrial Disease]]\", \"It Never Rains\", and the title track of the album, \"[[Love Over Gold (Dire Straits song)|Love Over Gold]]\". Shortly after the album's release, Pick Withers left the band.\n\nIn early 1983, with ''Love Over Gold'' still in the albums charts, the band released a four-song [[Extended play|EP]] titled ''[[ExtendedancEPlay]]''. Featuring the hit single \"[[Twisting by the Pool]]\", this was the first output by the band that featured new drummer [[Terry Williams (drummer)|Terry Williams]], (formerly of [[Rockpile]] and [[Man (band)|Man]]). An eight month long [[Love over Gold Tour]] followed which finished with two sold-out concerts at London's [[Hammersmith Odeon]] on 22 and 23 July 1983. In March 1984 the double album ''[[Alchemy: Dire Straits Live|Alchemy Live]]'' was released, which documented the recordings of these final two live shows. It was also released in [[VHS]] video and reached number three in the [[UK Albums Chart]], and was reissued in DVD and Blu-ray format in 2010.\n\nDuring 1983 and 1984, Mark Knopfler was also involved with other projects outside of Dire Straits, some of which other band members contributed towards.

It leaned heavily towards American roots music – [[Folk music|folk]], [[Blues]] and [[country music]]. The band members included keyboardist [[Guy Fletcher]], with [[Brendan Croker]] and [[Steve Phillips (musician)|Steve Phillips]]. For both the album and the tour [[Paul Franklin (musician)|Paul Franklin]] was added to the line-up on pedal steel. The Notting Hillbillies sole studio album, ''[[Missing...Presumed Having a Good Time]]'' was released in March 1990, and Knopfler then toured with the Notting Hillbillies for the remainder of that year. He further emphasised his country music influences with his 1990s collaboration with [[Chet Atkins]], ''[[Neck and Neck]]'', which won three Grammy awards. The Hillbillies toured the UK in early 1990 with a limited number of shows. In this low-key tour the band packed out smaller venues such as Newcastle University.\n\n[[File:Dire Straits 1985 Mark Knopfler Alan Clark Jack Sonni.jpg|thumb|Knopfler with Dire Straits performing in [[Belgrade]], 10 May 1985]]\nIn 1990, Knopfler, John Illsley, and Alan Clark [[Concerts at Knebworth House#Major concerts|performed as Dire Straits at Knebworth]], joined by Eric Clapton, [[Ray Cooper]], and guitarist [[Phil Palmer]] (who was at that time part of Eric Clapton's touring band), and in January the following year, Knopfler, John Illsley and manager [[Ed Bicknell]] decided to reform Dire Straits. Knopfler, Illsley, Alan Clark, and Guy Fletcher set about recording what turned out to be their final studio album accompanied by [[sideman|sidemen]] Phil Palmer, pedal steel guitarist [[Paul Franklin (musician)|Paul Franklin]], percussionist Danny Cummings and [[Toto (band)|Toto]] drummer [[Jeff Porcaro]].\n\nThe follow-up to ''Brothers in Arms'' was finally released in September 1991. ''[[On Every Street]]'' was nowhere near as popular as its predecessor, and met with a mixed critical reaction, with some reviewers regarding the album as an underwhelming comeback after a six-year break. Nonetheless, the album sold well and reached No. 1 in the UK. Session drummer [[Chris Whitten]] joined Dire Straits as they embarked on a gruelling [[On Every Street Tour|world tour]] featuring 300 shows in front of some 7.1 million ticket-buying fans. This was to be Dire Straits' final world tour; it was not as well received as the previous ''Brothers in Arms'' tour, and by this time Mark Knopfler had had enough of such huge operations. Manager [[Ed Bicknell]] is quoted as saying \"The last tour was utter misery. Whatever the [[zeitgeist]] was that we had been part of, it had passed.\" John Illsley agreed, saying \"Personal relationships were in trouble and it put a terrible strain on everybody, emotionally and physically. We were changed by it.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Paul|last=Rees|title=The sultan of swing|magazine=[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]] #210|date=June 2015|page=124}}</ref> This drove the band into the ground, and ultimately led to the group's final dissolution in 1995.\n\nFollowing the tour, Knopfler took some time off from the music business. In 1993, he received an honorary music doctorate from the University of Newcastle upon Tyne. Two more Dire Straits albums were released, both live albums. ''[[On the Night]]'', released in May 1993, documented Dire Straits' final world tour. In 1995, following the release of ''[[Live at the BBC (Dire Straits album)|Live at the BBC]]'' (a contractual release to [[Vertigo Records]]), Mark Knopfler quietly dissolved Dire Straits and launched his career as a solo artist. Knopfler later recalled that, \"I put the thing to bed because I wanted to get back to some kind of reality. It's self-protection, a survival thing. That kind of scale is dehumanizing.\"<ref name=\"telegraph\">{{cite web|last=McCormick |first=Neil |title=Mark Knopfler: how did we avoid disaster? |work=The Telegraph |date=5 September 2012 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/9522983/Mark-Knopfler-how-did-we-avoid-disaster.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220111/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/9522983/Mark-Knopfler-how-did-we-avoid-disaster.html |archive-date=11 January 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |access-date=25 November 2012}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Knopfler would spend two years recovering from the experience, which had taken a toll on his creative and personal life.\n\nSince the break-up of Dire Straits, Knopfler has shown no interest in reforming the group.

He reflected that the band members had \"reached the end of the road\" after the end of their final world tour in 1992, and that he was \"pretty happy\" when the band's run came to an end, recalling feeling \"mentally, physically and emotionally exhausted\" by the time Dire Straits disbanded.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/dire-straits-turn-down-huge-amounts-of-money-to-reform-3531223|title=Dire Straits turn down \"huge amounts of money\" to reform|first=Max|last=Pilley|website=NME|date=5 November 2023|access-date=19 November 2023}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/dire-straits-reunion-mark-knopfler-ilsley-b2441539.html|title=Dire Straits are in demand as 'huge amounts offered' for reunion|date=4 November 2023|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|access-date=19 November 2023}}</ref> At the time, Illsley also said \"I can openly admit to you that I really enjoyed the success of the band, I'm speaking for Mark as well, we both really enjoyed [it].

It featured the UK single \"[[Darling Pretty]]\". The album's recording sessions helped create Knopfler's backing band, which is also known as ''The 96ers''. It features Knopfler's old bandmate Guy Fletcher on keyboards. This band's main line-up has lasted much longer than any Dire Straits line-up. Also in 1996, Knopfler recorded guitar for Ted Christopher's [[Dunblane massacre]] tribute cover, ''[[Knockin' on Heaven's Door]]''.\n\nKnopfler composed his first film score in 1983 for [[Local Hero (film)|Local Hero]]. In 1997, Knopfler recorded the soundtrack for the movie ''Wag the Dog''. During that same year ''Rolling Stone'' magazine listed ''Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll'', which included \"[[Sultans of Swing]]\", Dire Straits' first hit. 2000 saw the release of Knopfler's next solo album, ''[[Sailing to Philadelphia]].'' This has been his most successful to date, possibly helped by the number of notable contributors to the album, like [[Van Morrison]]. On 15 September 1997, Knopfler appeared at the ''[[Music for Montserrat]]'' concert at the [[Royal Albert Hall]], London, performing alongside artists such as [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[Phil Collins]], [[Elton John]], [[Eric Clapton]] and [[Paul McCartney]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BwoEAAAAMBAJ&q=Music+for+Montserrat+-+concert&pg=PA59|title=Billboard 6 September 1997|access-date=27 September 2014|date=6 September 1997|archive-date=12 February 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220212114039/https://books.google.com/books?id=BwoEAAAAMBAJ&q=Music+for+Montserrat+-+concert&pg=PA59|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2002, Knopfler gave four charity concerts under the name of \"Mark Knopfler and friends\" with former Dire Straits members John Illsley, [[Chris White (saxophonist)|Chris White]], Danny Cummings and Guy Fletcher, playing old material from the Dire Straits years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailyecho.co.uk/news/19835420.pictures-remember-dire-straits-rocked-palace-house/|title=PICTURES: Who remembers when Dire Straits rocked the New Forest?|date=10 January 2022|website=Daily Echo|access-date=19 November 2023}}</ref> The concerts also featured The Notting Hillbillies with Brendan Croker and Steve Phillips.

In India, his concerts at Mumbai and Bangalore were well received, with over 20,000 fans at each concert.\n\nIn November 2005 a compilation, ''[[Private Investigations (album)|Private Investigations: The Best of Dire Straits & Mark Knopfler]]'' was released, consisting of material from most of Dire Straits' studio albums and Knopfler's solo and soundtrack material. The album was released in two editions, as a single CD (with a grey cover) and as a double CD (with the cover in blue), and was well received. The only previously unreleased track on the album is ''All the Roadrunning'', a duet with country music singer [[Emmylou Harris]], which was followed in 2006 by an album of duets of the same name.\n\nReleased in April 2006, ''[[All the Roadrunning]]'' reached No. 1 in Denmark and Switzerland, No. 2 in Norway and Sweden, No. 3 in Germany, The Netherlands and Italy, No. 8 in Austria and UK, No. 9 in Spain, No. 17 in the United States (''Billboard'' Top 200 Chart), No. 25 in Ireland, and No. 41 in Australia. ''All the Roadrunning'' was nominated for \"Best Folk Rock/Americana Album\" at the [[49th Grammy Awards]] (11 February 2007) but lost out to Bob Dylan's nomination for ''[[Modern Times (Bob Dylan album)|Modern Times]]''.\n\nJoined by Emmylou Harris, Knopfler supported ''All the Roadrunning'' with a limited—15 concerts in Europe, 1 in Canada, and 8 in the United States—but highly successful tour of Europe and North America.
