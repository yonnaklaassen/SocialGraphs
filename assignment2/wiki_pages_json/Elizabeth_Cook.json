Her mother, Joyce, played [[mandolin]] and guitar and performed on radio and local television. Her father, Thomas, also played string instruments. He honed his skills playing upright bass in the [[Atlanta Federal Penitentiary]] prison band while serving time for running [[moonshine]]. In prison he learned welding; Cook would name her 2010 album ''[[Welder (album)|Welder]]''.<ref name=\"NPR01\">[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=126910286 \"Elizabeth Cook: Daughter Of A 'Welder'\"] interview/report by [[All Things Considered]] host [[Melissa Block]], May 18, 2010.

She cut her major-label debut, 2002's ''[[Hey Y'all]]'', for [[Atlantic Records]].  ''Hey Y'all'' wasn't a success. After taking a shot at co-writing,  Cook  asked to be released from her contract.
