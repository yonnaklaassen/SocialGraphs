The duo was founded in 1990 through the suggestion of songwriter and record producer [[Tim DuBois]]. Before their formation, both members were solo recording artists, having charted two solo singles apiece in the 1980s. Brooks also released an album for [[Capitol Records]] in 1989 and wrote hit singles for other artists.\n\nThe duo signed to [[Arista Nashville]] after their foundation. They have recorded eleven studio albums, one Christmas album, and five compilation albums for the label. They also have released 50 singles, of which 20 went to number one on the [[Hot Country Songs]] charts and 19 more reached top 10. Two of these number-one songs, \"[[My Maria]]\" (a cover of the [[B.W. Stevenson]] song) and \"[[Ain't Nothing 'bout You]]\", were the top country songs of 1996 and 2001, respectively, according to the [[Billboard Year-End|''Billboard'' Year-End]] charts. The latter is also the duo's longest-lasting number-one single on that chart at six weeks. Several of their songs have also reached the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], with the number-25 peaks of \"Ain't Nothing 'bout You\" and \"[[Red Dirt Road (song)|Red Dirt Road]]\" being their highest there. Brooks and Dunn also won the [[Country Music Association]] Vocal Duo of the Year award every year between 1992 and 2006, except for 2000. Two of their songs won the [[Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]]: \"[[Hard Workin' Man (song)|Hard Workin' Man]]\" in 1994 and \"My Maria\" in 1996. All but two of the duo's studio albums are [[Music recording sales certification|certified platinum]] or higher by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]; their highest-certified is their 1991 debut album, ''[[Brand New Man]]'', which is certified sextuple-platinum for shipments of six million copies.\n\nThe duo's material is known for containing influences of [[honky-tonk]], mainstream country, and [[rock music|rock]], as well as the contrast between their singing voices and on-stage personalities, although some of their music has also been criticized as formulaic. Their 1992 single \"[[Boot Scootin' Boogie]]\" helped repopularize [[line dancing]] in the United States, and 2001's \"[[Only in America (song)|Only in America]]\" was used by both [[George W. Bush]] and [[Barack Obama]] in their respective presidential campaigns. Brooks and Dunn have collaborated with several artists, including [[Reba McEntire]], [[Vince Gill]], [[Sheryl Crow]], [[Mac Powell]], [[Billy Gibbons]], [[Jerry Jeff Walker]], and [[Luke Combs]].\n\nAfter announcing their retirement in August 2009, they performed their final concert on September 2, 2010, at the [[Bridgestone Arena]] in Nashville, Tennessee. Both Brooks and Dunn have continued to record for Arista Nashville as solo artists. Dunn released a [[Ronnie Dunn (album)|self-titled album]] in 2011, which included the top-10 country hit \"[[Bleed Red]]\", while Brooks released ''[[New to This Town]]'' in September 2012. The duo reunited in 2015 for a series of concerts with Reba McEntire in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]].  In 2019, the duo was inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum|Country Music Hall of Fame]].\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Kix Brooks|Ronnie Dunn}}\n===Kix Brooks===\nLeon Eric \"Kix\" Brooks III was born on May 12, 1955, in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]], and before moving to Nashville, Tennessee, in 1976, he played at various venues in [[Maine]].
