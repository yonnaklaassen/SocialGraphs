He used these for the unique sounds they produce, especially with a slide. In the early 1990s, he toured and recorded with [[Hani Naser]] adding [[percussion|percussive instrument]]s to his solo performances, and his instrumental repertoire which he used in his session work. Lindley also toured extensively and recorded with [[reggae]] percussionist [[Wally Ingram]]. \n\nLindley's voice may be heard in the version of \"[[Stay (Maurice Williams song)|Stay]]\" performed by [[Jackson Browne]].
