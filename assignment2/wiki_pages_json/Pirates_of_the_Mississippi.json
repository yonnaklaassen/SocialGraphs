The original members were Bill McCorvey (lead vocals, guitar), Rich Alves (lead guitar, background vocals), Jimmy Lowe (drums), Pat Severs ([[steel guitar]], [[Dobro]]), and Dean Townson (bass guitar, background vocals). Severs quit in 1994 and was briefly replaced with Greg Trostle. The band recorded for [[Capitol Records]], [[Liberty Records]], and [[Giant Records (Warner)|Giant Records]] between 1990 and 1995. They also charted nine singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts, the most successful being \"[[Feed Jake]]\", which went to number 15 in 1991. After disbanding in 1996, both Alves and McCorvey went on to write songs for other artists. In 2006, the two reunited under the Pirates of the Mississippi name, releasing an additional album titled ''Heaven and a Dixie Night'' before disbanding again. Pirates of the Mississippi are known for a [[country rock]] sound, and they received significant media attention for sociopolitical messages in some of their songs.\n\n==History==\nBill McCorvey, founder of Pirates of the Mississippi, had moved from [[Montgomery, Alabama]], to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], in the 1980s with the intent of pursuing a career in [[country music]]. When he was initially unable to do so, he supported himself financially by working various jobs. These included building houses and filling envelopes in a warehouse. While doing so he befriended Rich Alves and the two began writing songs together. Their original intent was to provide \"up-tempo\" material for [[Conway Twitty]] to record, but most of this material was not selected by him. Because of this, McCorvey and Alves decided to recruit other musicians to form a band and play the songs themselves. McCorvey served as lead vocalist, with Alves on lead guitar and backing vocals. Completing the original lineup were [[steel guitar]] and [[Dobro]] player Pat Severs, bass guitarist and backing vocalist Dean Townson, and drummer Jimmy Lowe. The five members began performing together in 1987.<ref name=\"montgomery\">{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/122198352/ | title=Going places: Capital City singer sails with Pirates | work=[[The Montgomery Advertiser]] | date=July 26, 1991 | access-date=September 19, 2022 | first=Rick|last=Harmon | pages=1D, [https://www.newspapers.com/clip/122239266/pirates/ 4D]}}</ref> Severs had played in [[Eddie Rabbitt]]'s band before becoming a [[session musician]], Lowe was a computer programmer, and Townson worked at an aviation factory.<ref name=\"larsen\">{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/122198392/ | title=Pirates of the Mississippi sailing despite rough waters | work=The Messenger | date=November 21, 1992 | access-date=September 20, 2022 | first=Dave|last=Larsen | pages=TV & Entertainment Magazine10}}</ref><ref name=\"jolly\">{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/122239311/countrys-jolly-pirates/ | title=Country's jolly Pirates | work=[[The Tennessean]] | date=November 23, 1991 | access-date=September 20, 2022 | first=Robert K.|last=Oermann|author-link=Robert K.

Rick Harmon of ''[[The Montgomery Advertiser]]'' described their style as having influences ranging from [[Led Zeppelin]] to [[Happy Goodman Family]], also calling their style a \"smoldering [[boogie]]\".<ref name=\"montgomery\"/> Because of their country rock influences, the band was frequently compared to [[The Kentucky Headhunters]], a country rock band who made their chart debut in 1989. As Pirates of the Mississippi's album was recorded before the Kentucky Headhunters' debut but not released until later, McCorvey thought that the initial commercial success of The Kentucky Headhunters had made country radio more accepting of a band with rock influences in the early 1990s.<ref name=\"montgomery\"/> [[Robert K. Oermann]] wrote in ''[[The Tennessean]]'' that the band had a \"rootsy, raucous, casual country rock blend\".<ref name=\"jolly\"/> In the same article, Alves stated that he intended for the band not to have an individual image unlike other contemporary bands, as he thought well-written songs would serve as an image on their own.<ref name=\"jolly\"/> McCorvey said that he was inspired by [[Southern rock]] acts he listened to growing up. He also stated that he preferred to write most of the band's music with Alves, but was open to outside material if he thought it was suitable.<ref name=\"treasure\">{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/122199266/ | title='Pirates' find treasure of musical material while on the road | work=The Montgomery Advertiser | date=October 30, 1992 | access-date=September 20, 2022 | first=Amelia|last= de Loach | pages=7C, [https://www.newspapers.com/clip/122239582/pirates/ 8C]}}</ref> Bernard Pilon of ''[[The Leader-Post]]'' described McCorvey as having a \"gravelled edge reminiscent of [[blues]] man [[Jeff Healey]]\",<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/122199292/ | title=Pirates show diverse talents | work=The Leader-Post |first=Bernard|last=Pilon | date=July 10, 1992 | access-date=September 20, 2022 | pages=F1}}</ref> with Pete Swanson of the ''[[Great Falls Tribune]]'' noting the \"no-frill three-part harmonies\" provided by Townson and Alves.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/122199329/ | title=Pirates of the Mississippi steal the show at JD's | work=Great Falls Tribune | date=May 11, 1995 | access-date=September 20, 2022 | first=Pete|last= Swanson | pages=10E}}</ref>\n\nMany of the band's songs feature sociopolitical themes in the lyrics, although Severs said this was not a primary intention of theirs.<ref name=\"post\"/> \"Feed Jake\" received media attention for including a lyric supportive of the gay community.<ref name=\"encyclopedia\"/> According to McCorvey, some stations refused to play the song for this reason, thus impacting its position on the charts.<ref name=\"jolly\"/> The editors of ''The Encyclopedia of Country Music'' also considered the song unusual in the band's discography, as it was a ballad compared to the \"bar band attitude\" of their other releases.<ref name=\"encyclopedia\">{{cite book |title=The Encyclopedia of Country Music |last=Kingsbury |first=Paul |year=2004 |publisher=Sourcebooks, Inc. |isbn=0-19-517608-1 |page=417 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v4GQDYx_RnkC&q=%22feed+jake&pg=PA417 |display-authors=etal}}</ref> The song's video portrays a relationship between two men, one of whom dies at the end.
