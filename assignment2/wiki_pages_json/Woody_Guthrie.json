[[Gunther von Fritsch]] was directing a documentary about the [[Bonneville Power Administration]]'s construction of the [[Grand Coulee Dam]] on the [[Columbia River]], and needed a narrator. Alan Lomax had recommended Guthrie to narrate the film and sing songs onscreen. The original project was expected to take 12 months, but as filmmakers became worried about casting such a political figure, they minimized Guthrie's role. The [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]] hired him for one month to write songs about the [[Columbia River]] and the construction of the federal dams for the documentary's soundtrack. Guthrie toured the Columbia River and the Pacific Northwest. Guthrie said he \"couldn't believe it, it's a paradise\",<ref>{{cite book|page=209|first=Ed|last=Cray|date=2004|title= Ramblin Man: The Life and Times of Woody Guthrie|url=https://archive.org/details/ramblinman00edcr|url-access=registration|publisher= W.

Guthrie returned to New York with plans to tour the country as a member of the group.<ref>Klein, ''Woody Guthrie'', p.192-93,195–231</ref> The singers originally worked out of a loft in New York City hosting regular concerts called \"[[hootenanny|hootenannies]]\", a word Pete and Woody had picked up in their cross-country travels. The singers eventually outgrew the space and moved into the cooperative Almanac House in [[Greenwich Village]].\n\nInitially, Guthrie helped write and sing what the Almanac Singers termed \"peace\" songs while the Nazi–Soviet Pact was in effect. After Hitler's invasion of the Soviet Union, the group wrote anti-fascist songs. The members of the Almanac Singers and residents of the Almanac House were a loosely defined group of musicians, though the core members included Guthrie, [[Pete Seeger]], [[Millard Lampell]] and [[Lee Hays]]. In keeping with common utopian ideals, meals, chores and rent at the Almanac House were shared. The Sunday hootenannies were good opportunities to collect donation money for rent. Songs written in the Almanac House had shared songwriting credits among all the members, although in the case of \"[[Union Maid]]\", members would later state that Guthrie wrote the song, ensuring that his children would receive residuals.<ref>{{cite book|page=220|first=Ed|last=Cray|date=2004|title= Ramblin Man: The Life and Times of Woody Guthrie|url=https://archive.org/details/ramblinman00edcr|url-access=registration|publisher= W.

And for a New York Left that was primarily Jewish, first or second generation American, and was desperately trying to get Americanized, I think a figure like Woody was of great, great importance,\" a friend of the group, [[Irwin Silber]], would say.<ref>{{cite book|page=216|first=Ed|last=Cray|date=2004|title= Ramblin Man: The Life and Times of Woody Guthrie|url=https://archive.org/details/ramblinman00edcr|url-access=registration|publisher= W.

After a recording session with Alan Lomax, Lomax suggested Guthrie write an autobiography.

Mazia was an instructor at the [[Martha Graham Center of Contemporary Dance|Martha Graham Dance School]], where she was assisting [[Sophie Maslow]] with her piece ''Folksay''. Based on the folklore and poetry collected by [[Carl Sandburg]], ''Folksay'' included the adaptation of some of Guthrie's ''Dust Bowl Ballads'' for the dance.<ref name=Cray200/> Guthrie continued to write songs and began work on his autobiography.

The ''Library Journal'' complained about the \"too careful reproduction of illiterate speech\". However, Clifton Fadiman, reviewing the book in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', remarked that \"Someday people are going to wake up to the fact that Woody Guthrie and the ten thousand songs that leap and tumble off the strings of his music box are a national possession, like [[Yellowstone]] and [[Yosemite]], and part of the best stuff this country has to show the world.\"<ref>Isserman, Maurice [https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2004-01-18-0401170325-story.html \"Life of Woody Guthrie is thorough, if unoriginal\"], ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', Chicago, January 18, 2004.

Over the next few years, he recorded \"[[Worried Man Blues]]\", along with [[Woody Guthrie discography#1944 & 1945, The Asch Recordings|hundreds of other songs]].

He received various diagnoses (including alcoholism and [[schizophrenia]]). In 1952, it was finally determined that he was suffering from [[Huntington's disease]],<ref name=\"Celebrity Diagnosis\"/> a genetic disorder inherited from his mother. Believing him to be a danger to their children because of his behavior, Marjorie suggested he return to California without her. They eventually divorced<!--or, they divorced in[year]-->.<ref>Klein, ''Woody Guthrie'', p.&nbsp;388–94,&nbsp;399.</ref>\n\nUpon his return to California, Guthrie lived at the [[Theatricum Botanicum]], a summer-stock type theatre founded and owned by [[Will Geer]]. Together with singers and actors who had been blacklisted by [[HUAC]], he waited out the [[anti-communist]] political climate.\n\nAs his health worsened, he met and married his third wife, Anneke Van Kirk. They had a child, Lorina Lynn. The couple moved to [[Fruit Cove, Florida]], where they briefly lived. They lived in a bus on land called [[Beluthahatchee]], owned by his friend [[Stetson Kennedy]]. Guthrie's arm was hurt in an accident when gasoline used to start the campfire exploded. Although he regained movement in the arm, he was never able to play the guitar again. In 1954, the couple returned to New York,<ref>Klein, ''Woody Guthrie'', p.&nbsp;418–19.</ref> living in the Beach Haven apartment complex owned and operated by [[Fred Trump]] in [[Gravesend, Brooklyn]]; Guthrie composed there the song \"[[Old Man Trump]]\". Shortly after, Anneke filed for divorce, a result of the strain of caring for Guthrie. Anneke left New York after arranging for friends to adopt Lorina Lynn. Lorina had no further contact with her birth parents. She died in a car accident in California in 1973 at the age of 19.<ref name=\"Ed Cray 2006 16\" /> After the divorce, Guthrie's second wife, Marjorie, re-entered his life and cared for him until his death.\n\nIncreasingly unable to control his muscles, Guthrie was hospitalized at [[Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital]] in Morris County, New Jersey, from 1956 to 1961; at Brooklyn State Hospital (now Kingsboro Psychiatric Center) in [[East Flatbush, Brooklyn|East Flatbush]] until 1966;<ref>Klein, ''Woody Guthrie'', p.&nbsp;433–39</ref> and finally at [[Creedmoor Psychiatric Center]] in [[Queens Village, Queens|Queens Village]], New York, until his death in 1967.<ref>Klein, ''Woody Guthrie'', p.&nbsp;460.</ref> Marjorie and the children visited Guthrie at Greystone every Sunday. They answered fan mail and the children played on the hospital grounds. Eventually, a longtime fan of Guthrie invited the family to his nearby home for the Sunday visits. This lasted until Guthrie was moved to the Brooklyn State Hospital, which was closer to [[Howard Beach, Queens|Howard Beach]], New York, where Marjorie and the children then lived.\n\nDuring the final few years of his life, Guthrie had become isolated except for family.

In later years, he'd say, \"I'm not a Communist, but I've been in the red all my life.\" He took great delight in proclaiming his hopes for a communist victory in the Korean War and more than once expressed his admiration for Stalin.

Guthrie, the Oklahoma troubadour, and Greenblatt, the Jewish wordsmith, often discussed their artistic projects and critiqued each other's works, finding common ground in their shared love of culture and social justice. Their collaboration flourished in 1940s Brooklyn, where Jewish culture was interwoven with music, modern dance, poetry and anti-fascist, pro-labor, socialist activism. Guthrie was inspired to write songs that arose from this unlikely relationship; he identified the problems of Jews with those of his fellow Okies and other oppressed peoples.\n\nThese lyrics were rediscovered by [[Nora Guthrie]] and were set to music by the Jewish Klezmer group [[The Klezmatics]] with the release of ''Happy Joyous Hanukkah'' on JMG Records in 2007. The Klezmatics also released ''Wonder Wheel&nbsp;– Lyrics by Woody Guthrie'', an album of spiritual lyrics put to music composed by the band.<ref>WoodyGuthrie.org.

The fictional Woody also reflects the fictitious autobiographies that Dylan constructed during his early career as he established his own artistic identity. In the film there is even a scene where the fictional Woody visits the real Woody Guthrie as he lies ill and dying in a hospital in New York (a reference to the times when a nineteen-year-old Dylan would regularly visit his idol, after learning of his whereabouts, while he was hospitalized in New York in the 1960s).
