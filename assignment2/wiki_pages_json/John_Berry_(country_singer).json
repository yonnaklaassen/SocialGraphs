He had just lost his mother earlier that year. Doctors were afraid that he might not walk again. He spent several months in physical therapy, working to regain the use of his legs. Berry said of the incident, \"The coolest thing in the world that came out of it... all I could do is sit on my stool and play guitar. That's all I've done ever since.\"<ref name=\"nexxus\"/>\n\nTwo years later, Berry started performing solo acoustic shows in northeast Georgia (Athens), then expanded around the Southeast, building a strong name and following. He eventually made six self-produced albums, with the last one selling over 10,000 copies. He was finally signed to [[Liberty Records]] in 1992.<ref name=\"journal\"/>\nBerry received high praise from former President [[George H. W.
