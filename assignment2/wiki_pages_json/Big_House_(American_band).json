Grounded in the [[Bakersfield Sound]], originally, the band consisted of [[Monty Byrom]] ([[lead vocals]], [[guitar]]), David Neuhauser ([[guitar]], [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]]), Chuck Seaton ([[guitar]]), Tanner Byrom ([[drums]]), Sonny California ([[harmonica]]), and Ron Mitchell ([[bass guitar]]). Under this lineup, Big House recorded two albums for [[MCA Nashville]]: 1997's ''Big House'' and 1998's ''Travelin' Kind''. These two albums produced four chart singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country charts, including the No.&nbsp;30 hit \"Cold Outside.\"\n\nAfter the release of their second album, all of the band's members departed except for Monty Byrom and David Neuhauser. Benny Rappa was then signed as the band's new drummer, and Steve Vines assumed the role of bass guitarist. The revamped lineup recorded one album for [[Dead Reckoning Records]] before disbanding in 2000.  The six original members reunited for concerts in 2007 and 2008, and released a fourth album in 2008 ''Never Ending Train.''\n\n==Biography==\nAlthough its six members (all natives of [[Bakersfield, California]]) had all performed together in various lineups, Big House was not officially formed until 1995, when brothers Monty and Tanner Byrom first performed with four other musicians at a venue in [[Oildale, California]].<ref name=\"pollstar\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pollstar.com/news/viewhotstar.pl?Artist=BIGHOU |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020423023926/http://pollstar.com/news/viewhotstar.pl?Artist=BIGHOU |url-status=dead |archive-date=2002-04-23 |title=Big House |accessdate=2007-12-30 |date=1997-06-02 |work=Pollstar}} </ref><ref name=\"played\"/> After realizing that they all seemed to work well together, the six musicians decided to form a band.
