He formed his own [[rock and roll]] band, and became a local [[celebrity|star]] at the Bamboo Ranch in [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] in the late 1950s and early 1960s, where his singing style was influenced by African-American performers, including [[Sam Cooke]].<ref name=allmusic/>\nRoyal was a friend of performer and [[songwriter]]  [[Joe South]], and recorded what was intended as a [[demo (music)|demo]] of South's song \"[[Down in the Boondocks (song)|Down in the Boondocks]]\". The recording was heard at [[Columbia Records]], who offered Royal a singing contract in 1965 and released his version of the song, produced by South.<ref name=allmusic/> \"Down in the Boondocks\" remained his best-known song, reaching number 9 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://musicvf.com/song.php?id=4964|title=Down in the Boondocks (song by Billy Joe Royal) ••• Music VF, US & UK hits charts|website=Musicvf.com|access-date=August 10, 2021}}</ref> and number 38 in the [[UK Singles Chart|UK]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/artist/12029/billy-joe-royal/|title=BILLY JOE ROYAL &#124; full Official Chart History|website=Officialcharts.com|access-date=August 10, 2021}}</ref>\n\nHe followed up his initial success with the [[single (music)|singles]] \"[[I Knew You When (Billy Joe Royal song)|I Knew You When]]\" (Top 20, 1965) and \"[[Hush (Billy Joe Royal song)|Hush]]\" (1967), also written and produced by Joe South.  Another South composition, \"[[Yo-Yo (Billy Joe Royal song)|Yo-Yo]]\", just missed the top 40 in Canada and charted poorly in the U.S. when Royal released it in 1967, but a later remake by [[The Osmonds]] was a much greater success.  His 1969 single, \"[[Cherry Hill Park]]\", peaked at No.&nbsp;15 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref name=billyjoeroyal.com>{{cite web|title=Billy Joe Royal|url=http://billyjoeroyal.com/|publisher=Billyjoeroyal.com/|access-date=March 29, 2011}}</ref>  In the 1970s his recording of \"Heart's Desire\" gained popularity among [[Northern soul]] enthusiasts and was regularly played in Northern soul nightclubs.<ref name=\"TooDarnSoulful\">{{cite book | title=Too Darn Soulful – The Story of Northern Soul | publisher=Robson Books | author=Nowell, David | year=1999 | location=London | pages=118 | isbn=1-86105-270-7}}</ref>\n\nBy the late 1970s, Royal had become a regular performer in [[Las Vegas]], and also appeared as an actor in movies and on television.  His last hit on the US pop charts was in 1978, when his version of \"[[Under the Boardwalk]]\" became a minor hit.  However, he reinvented himself in the 1980s as a mainstream [[country music|country]] star, and had his first hit on the [[Hot Country Songs|country music chart]] in 1985 with \"[[Burned Like a Rocket]]\", released on the [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]] label.  His other country hits included \"[[I'll Pin a Note on Your Pillow]]\" (1987), \"[[Tell It Like It Is (song)|Tell It Like It Is]]\", and \"[[Till I Can't Take It Anymore]]\" (both 1989).  His successes on the country charts continued until the early 1990s.<ref name=allmusic/>\n\nRoyal experienced a second comeback during the 2000s due to regular airplay on Country and Classic radio stations.  His music was further exposed to younger generations through a movement known as [[The Beat Army]], an online music forum based on Facebook which is operated by author and music producer [[Paul Collins (musician)|Paul Collins]].  Royal continued to tour regularly, performing concerts at casinos, music festivals, and clubs in North America, Japan, and throughout Europe.  His set lists included a mixture of songs representing multiple genres from the 1960s onwards.
