Dove and his first wife, Catherine Pearl née Smith Dove Rusk, was born in [[Herndon, Virginia]], United States, his older sister is Marjorie L. Forrester.  During his stint in the Coast Guard, Dove began his singing career in the clubs of [[Baltimore]], where he was stationed. He formed a group, The Belltones, and they played Baltimore and the East Coast for four years. In 1959, they recorded their debut single \"Lover Boy\" on their own label.  In 1961, they released a cover of the [[Buddy Knox]] hit \"[[Party Doll]]\" on [[Decca Records]], but it failed to chart. They issued one more single on Jalo Records before the group broke up and Dove went solo.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.45cat.com/record/31288|title=Ronnie Dove And The Beltones - Party Doll|website=45cat.com|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nHe went solo and signed with [[Diamond Records]] in 1964. His first solo single, \"Sweeter Than Sugar\" appeared in April 1964 to no national fanfare, though it did appear in some local hit parades.  Later that year, Diamond released \"[[Say You (Ronnie Dove song)|Say You]]\" which peaked at position #40 by means of the Billboard hit parade, and became his first national hit parade success. The next single, a cover of [[Wanda Jackson]]'s \"[[Right or Wrong (Wanda Jackson song)|Right Or Wrong]],\" put him into the Top 20.  In 1965, he had 5 chart singles and after just three albums [[Diamond Records]] released a \"best of\" collection.  His name was featured many times in both ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' and ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]]'' awards in 1965.\n\nMore hits came in 1966 and 1967 including \"My Babe\", “[[Cry (Churchill Kohlman song)|Cry]]”, \"[[Happy Summer Days]]\" and several others.\nAfter releasing his cover of [[Johnnie Ray]]’s song “Cry”, Ronnie appeared on [[The Ed Sullivan Show]] to sing the song.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0724859/|title=\"The Ed Sullivan Show\" Connie Francis, Flip Wilson, Henny Youngman, Stiller & Meara (TV Episode 1967) |website=IMDb.com|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref> He continued to record for Diamond until it was sold in 1970 to [[Aubrey Mayhew]]'s Certron Records.  There, he recorded a live album and several singles that went unreleased. However, Certron did issue a “Greatest Hits” compilation of his Diamond songs, as well as one unreleased song.  The label had money issues from the start and went bankrupt in 1971.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bsnpubs.com/nyc/diamond/diamond.html|title=Diamond Album Discography|website=Bsnpubs.com|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref> Shortly thereafter, he went to the independent Wrayco Records and released a [[Bobby Hebb]] cover of the song \"[[Sunny (Bobby Hebb song)|Sunny]]”.  The single received no promotion from the label and subsequently failed to chart.\n\n===Country music===\nAfter his stints with Certron and Wrayco, he signed a new deal with [[Decca Records]] in 1971 and pointed his career in a more country oriented direction, scoring two minor country chart hits and an album. Later, he moved to the [[Motown]] country label Melodyland and had a top 40 country hit with a cover of [[Bobby Darin]]’s \"[[Things (Bobby Darin song)|Things]]\", which would become his highest charting country hit, reaching #25.  During this period, he recorded two albums of country music, but neither ended up being released.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bsnpubs.com/motown/mc/mc.html|title=M.C. Album Discography|website=Bsnpubs.com|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>  Although he moved to some smaller, independent labels throughout the rest of the 1970’s and 1980’s, he still continued to record.  Dove opened his own club in Baltimore, and his fans were able to see him perform through the 1980s.  He briefly revived the Diamond record label in 1987 to release a couple of singles and an album.  These two singles managed to reach the lower rungs of Billboard's Country charts.\n\n==Later career==\nDove quit show business in 1989 to care for his ailing mother.  She died in 1991, and Dove resumed performing.  Dove continued to perform, mostly on the East Coast, and nationwide.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ronniedove.com/index-24.html|title=Ronnie Dove/ Biography|website=Ronniedove.com|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref> There have been several compilations issued on CD, including ''The Complete Original Chart Hits: 1964-69'', available from Real Gone Music.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.realgonemusic.com/news/2014/5/14/ronnie-dove.html|title=Real Gone Music - News - Ronnie Dove|website=Realgonemusic.com|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>  Dove owns the rights to his music catalog.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ronniedovemusic.com/contact.html|title = Contact Ronnie Dove Music}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, Ronnie Dove Music reissued his 1967 album ''[[Cry (Ronnie Dove album)|Cry]]'' album digitally, sourced from newly available tapes.
