In addition, Austin has recorded five studio albums.\n\n==Biography==\nAustin released his first album, ''[[What My Heart Already Knows]]'', on May 6, 1997. The album was certified [[Music recording sales certification|gold]] by the [[Canadian Recording Industry Association]] for sales of 50,000 copies,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.julianaustin.com/Bio2.html |accessdate=June 1, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070402093631/http://www.julianaustin.com/Bio2.html |archivedate=April 2, 2007 |title=Julian Austin Official Site }}</ref> and the first single, \"[[Little Ol' Kisses]],\" went to No.&nbsp;1 the Canadian country singles chart. That same year, Austin won the Wrangler Rising Star Award from the [[Canadian Country Music Association]] (CCMA). All of the additional singles released from the album reached the top 20, including the No.&nbsp;3 song, \"Diamond.\" In 1998, Austin was nominated for Best Country Male Vocalist at the [[Juno Award]]s, but lost to [[Paul Brandt]].\n\nHe moved to [[Calgary]], Alberta in 1998 to work on his second album.
