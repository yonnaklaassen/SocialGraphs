Between 1990 and 1999, he had his greatest chart success recording for [[Universal Music Group Nashville]]'s [[MCA Records|MCA]] and [[Decca Records|Decca]] branches, with a total of eight albums between those two labels. During this timespan, Chesnutt also charted twenty top-ten hits on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts, of which eight reached number one: \"[[Brother Jukebox]]\", \"[[I'll Think of Something]]\", \"[[It Sure Is Monday]]\", \"[[Almost Goodbye (song)|Almost Goodbye]]\", \"[[I Just Wanted You to Know]]\", \"[[Gonna Get a Life]]\", \"[[It's a Little Too Late (Mark Chesnutt song)|It's a Little Too Late]]\", and a cover of [[Aerosmith]]'s \"[[I Don't Want to Miss a Thing]]\". His first three albums for MCA (''[[Too Cold at Home]]'', ''[[Longnecks & Short Stories]]'', and ''[[Almost Goodbye]]'') along with a 1996 ''[[Greatest Hits (Mark Chesnutt album)|Greatest Hits]]'' package issued on Decca are all [[music recording sales certification|certified platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA); 1994's ''[[What a Way to Live]]'', also issued on Decca, is certified gold. After a self-titled album in 2002 on [[Columbia Records]], Chesnutt has continued to record predominantly on independent labels.\n\nChesnutt is known for his [[neotraditionalist country]] and [[honky-tonk]] influences, with frequent stylistic comparisons to [[George Jones]]. He has recorded several cover songs as both singles and album cuts, including covers of [[Hank Williams Jr.]], [[John Anderson (singer)|John Anderson]], [[Don Gibson]], [[Conway Twitty]], and [[Charlie Rich]]. Artists with whom he has collaborated include Jones, [[Tracy Byrd]], [[Vince Gill]], and [[Alison Krauss]]. [[Mark Wright (record producer)|Mark Wright]] produced all but one of his albums released in the 1990s, while his work since 2005 has been produced by [[Jimmy Ritchey]]. Chesnutt has also won two awards from the [[Country Music Association]]: the Horizon Award (now known as Best New Artist) and Vocal Event of the Year, both in 1993.\n\n==Biography==\nMark Nelson Chesnutt was born on September 6, 1963, in [[Beaumont, Texas]].<ref name=\"allmusic\"/><ref name=\"whitburn\"/> He drew musical influence from his father,  Bob Chesnutt, who was a singer and record collector.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/112498649/ | title=Triple No. 1s fulfill Mark's dad's dream | work=[[The Tennessean]] | date=July 27, 1991 | access-date=February 28, 2019 | author=Robert K.

Some of his songs, such as \"It Sure Is Monday\" and \"Gonna Get a Life\", have featured influences of [[Cajun music]] through prominent use of fiddle and accordion.<ref name=\"encyclopedia\"/>\n\nChesnutt's musical persona placed a greater emphasis on song quality over physical attractiveness, compared to the move toward young and attractive males that prevailed in country music in the 1990s. Nash stated that he \"distanced himself from the pack with an identifiable baritone and a focus on music over image\",<ref name=\"nash wings\"/> and Barry Gilbert of the ''St. Louis Post-Dispatch'' similarly stated that he \"put the music and his warm, classic-country voice before the image.\"<ref name=\"dispatch\"/> Chesnutt stated in a 1996 interview that \"I would rather play honky-tonks the rest of my life for $500 a week than be something I'm not.\"<ref name=\"hurst\"/> He noted that during his latter years at Decca and MCA, he was constantly pressured by label heads to record more mainstream-friendly country pop instead of the traditional sounds of his earlier albums, due to the genre's shift away from neotraditional country having a negative impact on his album sales.<ref name=\"chron\">{{cite web | url=https://www.chron.com/entertainment/article/Mark-Chesnutt-breaks-out-with-Outlaw-1597251.php | title=Mark Chesnutt breaks out with Outlaw | work=Houston Chronicle | date=June 28, 2010 | access-date=March 28, 2019}}</ref> He also said that some of the tracks on ''Savin' the Honky Tonk'' were songs that the major labels had rejected, and that he would \"rather sell 100,000 albums [of traditional country] than 6 million of some crap that I wasn't happy with.\"<ref name=\"reno\"/>\n\n==Personal life==\nChesnutt has been married to the former Tracie Motley since 1992. The two met in a bar, and according to Chesnutt, \"She came out there with a guy she was with at the time, and I took her away from him\".<ref name=\"hurst\"/> The couple have three sons: Waylon, Casey, and Cameron.<ref name=\"sculley\">{{cite web | url=https://www.mcall.com/news/mc-xpm-1999-08-08-3264684-story.html | title=It's more than a tradition thing for country's mark Chesnutt | work=The Morning Call | date=August 8, 1999 | access-date=March 26, 2019 | author=Alan Sculley}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.zanesvilletimesrecorder.com/story/news/local/2016/03/24/mark-chesnutt-play-smiling-goat/82208708/ | title=Mark Chesnutt to play Smiling Goat | work=Zanesville Times Recorder | date=March 24, 2016 | access-date=March 26, 2019}}</ref> Waylon was named after Waylon Jennings, who jokingly suggested during the recording sessions for their cover of \"Rainy Day Woman\" that the then-pregnant Tracie name their child after him. Although Jennings later stated that the suggestion was a joke, Chesnutt decided to choose the name anyway.<ref name=\"bonna\"/> In late 1995, following Waylon Chesnutt's birth, Tracie typically stayed home at the couple's house in [[Jasper, Texas]], while also working as an artist.<ref name=\"bonna\"/> The birth of his sons also caused Chesnutt to tour less frequently by the end of the 1990s, as he wanted to be able to spend more time with his family.<ref name=\"sculley\"/>\n\n===Health===\nIn October 2021, Chesnutt announced that he would be taking a hiatus from touring until 2022 in order to recover from back surgery.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.countrystandardtime.com/news/newsitem.asp?xid=12007 | title=Chesnutt cancels all '21 shows, needs more time off after surgery | publisher=Country Standard Time | date=October 13, 2021 | access-date=October 13, 2021}}</ref> On November 1, 2023, Chesnutt was hospitalized for an issue that required critical care, and underwent multiple tests to determine the exact problem.
