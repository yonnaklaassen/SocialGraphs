She had ten siblings, all of them boys, However, two died early from an accidental fire.\n\nIn 1929, Blevins went to [[California]] to study violin at the [[UCLA|University of the West]] (UCLA). She won a local talent contest with her singing, [[yodel]]ling, and playing the guitar and first prize was an opportunity to play on the ''Hollywood Breakfast Club'' radio program.\n\nIn the summer of 1933, Blevins went with two of her brothers to the [[Century of Progress|Chicago World's Fair]]. The trip's mission was to enter a large, prize watermelon the Blevins had raised, and Rubye was invited to go, mainly to meet up with two pen pals, Millie and Dolly Good (The [[Girls of the Golden West (country music duo)|Girls of the Golden West]]). While in [[Chicago]], she auditioned for a crooner's role. However, she began laughing halfway through the song. The producer on hand fell in love with her \"giggle\" and auditioned her instead at [[WLS (AM)|WLS-AM]] for a group called the [[Prairie Ramblers]].<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> Blevins and the Ramblers became regulars on WLS's ''[[National Barn Dance]]'' program. The Prairie Ramblers also backed Blevins on most of her hits with ARC Records, [[Decca Records|Decca]], and [[RCA Victor]].\n{{external media | width = 210px | float= right | headerimage=[[File:Patsy Montana.jpg|210px]] |\naudio1 = [http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/media/gallery/Audio/patsy_montana_song.mp3 “I Want to Be a Cowboy’s Sweetheart” ], performed by Patsy Montana, [[Encyclopedia of Arkansas]]}}\n\nIn 1934, Blevins' repertoire included \"Montana Plains\", a reworking of a song originally called \"Texas Plains\".  Blevins further altered the composition, which became her signature song, \"[[I Want to Be a Cowboy's Sweetheart]]\".<ref name=\"AMG\"/>  Released in 1935, the song made Blevins the first female country recording artist to have a million seller. <ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\">{{cite book\n| first= Joseph\n| last= Murrells\n| year= 1978\n| title= The Book of Golden Discs\n| edition= 2nd\n| publisher= Barrie and Jenkins Ltd\n| location= London\n| page= [https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/20 20]\n| isbn= 0-214-20512-6\n| url-access= registration\n| url= https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/20\n}}</ref> Blevins performed on ''National Barn Dance'' until the 1950s, and worked with  [[Gene Autry]], [[Pat Buttram]], [[Red Foley]], the [[Girls of the Golden West (country music duo)|Girls of the Golden West]] and [[George Gobel]].\n\nBlevins took her stage name from [[silent film]] star and world-champion [[Cowboy|roper]] [[Monte Montana]], with whom she had an opportunity to work early in her career.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> She made one feature-length movie called ''[[Colorado Sunset]]'' with [[Smiley Burnette]] and Gene Autry.\n\n''Barn Dance'' also introduced her to her future husband, Paul E. Rose. Rose was a stage manager for Gene Autry at the time, and was always around when Autry was performing, which just so happened to be when Patsy was performing. According to Patsy (as she was by this time called by everyone who knew her), they were the \"only two single people involved with the show and kinda got thrown together.\" Though Rose was around five years her junior, they married on July 3, \"honeymooned,\" and July 4 went their separate ways on different tours. Two weeks later they were again united, but throughout their married life they often followed this pattern. The couple had two daughters, Beverly and Judy. Montana and her two daughters later appeared as the Patsy Montana Trio.\n\n[[File:Patsy Montana and daughters.jpg|thumb|left|Patsy Montana with daughters Beverly and Judy]]\nAfter semi-retiring in the late 1950s to spend more time with her family, Montana attempted a comeback in 1964.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> She released an album on the Sims label in [[Arizona]], notable for having [[Waylon Jennings]] as lead guitar player before he made his national debut.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> The album was later re-released by [[Starday Records]].
