After establishing himself in the [[Music of Detroit#Hip hop|Detroit hip hop]] scene, he broke through into mainstream success with a [[rap rock]] sound before shifting his performance style to [[country rock]]. A self-taught musician, he has said he can play every instrument in his backing band and has overseen production on all but two of his albums.\n\nKid Rock started his music career as a rapper and DJ, releasing his debut album ''[[Grits Sandwiches for Breakfast]]'' (1990), on [[Jive Records]]. His subsequent independent releases ''[[The Polyfuze Method]]'' (1993) and ''[[Early Mornin' Stoned Pimp]]'' (1996) saw him developing a more distinctive style, which was fully realized on his breakthrough album ''[[Devil Without a Cause]]'' (1998), which sold 14 million copies. This album and its follow-up, ''[[Cocky (album)|Cocky]]'' (2001), were noted for blending elements of hip-hop, country and rock.\n\nHis most successful single from that time period, \"[[Cowboy (Kid Rock song)|Cowboy]]\" (1999), is considered a pioneering song in the [[country rap]] genre. His best-selling singles overall are \"[[Picture (song)|Picture]]\" (2002) and \"[[All Summer Long (Kid Rock song)|All Summer Long]]\" (2008). Starting with his 2007 album ''[[Rock n Roll Jesus]]'', his musical output has tended to be in the country rock style. Politically, Ritchie is a vocal supporter of the U.S. [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and holds conservative views.\n\n==Early life==\nKid Rock was born Robert James Ritchie in [[Romeo, Michigan]], on January 17, 1971, the son of Susan and William \"Bill\" Ritchie (1941–2024),<ref>{{cite web |title=Bill Ritchie, former Sterling Heights auto dealer and father of Kid Rock, dies in Florida |url=https://www.freep.com/story/entertainment/music/brian-mccollum/2024/02/16/bill-ritchie-father-of-kid-rock-and-ex-sterling-heights-auto-dealer-dies/72633949007/ |website=www.freep.com}}</ref> who owned multiple car dealerships.<ref name=\"Biography\">{{cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/kid-rock-251986|title=Kid Rock|website=Biography.com|access-date=October 13, 2017|archive-date=October 13, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171013224846/https://www.biography.com/people/kid-rock-251986|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"Allmusic\"/><ref name=\"cowboysindians\"/> He was raised in his father's large home on extensive property,<ref name=\"Biography\"/><ref name=Freep2016>{{cite web|url=http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/macomb/2016/11/04/kid-rock-macomb-county-house/93299716/|title=Kid Rock's posh childhood home listed in Macomb County for $1.3M|website=Freep.com|access-date=November 3, 2017|archive-date=November 7, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107142821/http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/macomb/2016/11/04/kid-rock-macomb-county-house/93299716/|url-status=live}}</ref> which included an [[apple orchard]] and barnyard for their horses.<ref name=\"The Independent\">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/my-secret-life-kid-rock-musician-age-37-870596.html|title=My Secret Life: Kid Rock Musician (age 37)|last=Philby|first=Charlotte|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|access-date=November 30, 2010|location=London|date=July 19, 2008|archive-date=March 24, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324122407/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/my-secret-life-kid-rock-musician-age-37-870596.html|url-status=live}}</ref> He attended [[Romeo High School]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.dailytribune.com/2011/04/22/kid-rock-visits-romeo-high-school-donates-money/amp/ | title=Kid Rock visits Romeo High School, donates money | date=April 22, 2011 }}</ref> His younger sister, [[Jill Ritchie]], is an actress.<ref name=Heartbreak/> In the 1980s, Kid Rock became interested in [[hip hop]], began to [[breakdance]], and taught himself how to rap and DJ while performing in talent shows in and around [[Detroit]].<ref name=Biography/><ref name=\"Allmusic\">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist |id=kid-rock-p15074/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Kid Rock – Biography|last=Huey|first=Jeff |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=November 30, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===Early career, signing with Jive Records, and ''Grits Sandwiches for Breakfast'' (1988–1991)===\nKid Rock began his professional music career as a member of a [[hip hop music]] group called the Beast Crew in the late 1980s.<ref name=Biography/> During this time, he met rapper [[D-Nice]].

He explained in a 2000 ''Rolling Stone'' interview, \"I've got a lot of faith in people. Whether it's some kid with a trust fund that people tease because he's got a trust fund, you know.
