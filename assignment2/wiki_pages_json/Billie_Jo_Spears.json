She was known for a series of [[Single (music)|singles]] whose characters often represented women in assertive positions. Among these recordings was a song about sexual harassment (\"[[Mr. Walker, It's All Over]]\"), and a song about rekindling sexual desire (\"[[Blanket on the Ground]])\".\n\nSpears was raised in a working-class Texas family. She made her first recording at age 13 on the [[Abbott Records|Abbott]] label. Singer–songwriter [[Jack Rhodes]] discovered her early music and helped her secure a professional partnership with producer Kelso Herston. Under Herston's production, she had her first top-ten song with 1969's \"Mr. Walker, It's All Over\" (issued on [[Capitol Records]]). Several follow-up releases were not successful, and after recovering from a vocal setback she returned to United Artists. Her second release was 1975's \"Blanket on the Ground\", which topped the American country chart and became a commercial [[Pop music|pop]] success in several countries.\n\nSpears followed with several more American top ten and top 20 country songs like \"[[What I've Got in Mind]]\", \"[[Misty Blue]]\", \"[[If You Want Me (song)|If You Want Me]]\", \"[['57 Chevrolet (song)|'57 Chevrolet]]\" and a cover of \"[[I Will Survive]]\". Spears continued to have success overseas, particularly in the United Kingdom where she had several more top 40 songs. In 1981, Spears left United Artists (now [[Liberty Records|Liberty]]) and recorded several albums with British labels during the 1980's and 90's. She also continued to tour throughout, most notably in the United Kingdom. Meanwhile, Spears married and divorced five times between the 1960's and 90's.

Writers Mary A. Bufwack and Robert K. Oermann found that her sixties-era recordings had a \"diminutive honky-tonker\" style{{sfn|Bufwack|Oermann|2003|p=271}} while Richie Unterberger of AllMusic found the same selections to have \"harder edge\" compared to other female artists.<ref name=\"Mr Walker\"/> Many writers found that Spears's United Artists/Liberty recordings shifted towards [[country pop]] and [[Disco|country disco]].<ref name=\"Music Row\"/> Author Kurt Wolff disagreed in his book ''Country Music: The Rough Guide'': \"Though Billie Jo Spears had her biggest hits during the 1970s, she was far more earthy and grounded than most singers passing for 'country' during the decade.\"<ref name=\"Rough Guide\"/>\n\nBufwack and Oermann found that her late seventies music was \"some of the most distinctive pop-country fusion discs of the day.\"{{sfn|Bufwack|Oermann|2003|p=356-357}} Stephen L.

Bufwack and Oermann commented that she had a \"Texas accent as thick as salsa and twice as tangy.\"{{sfn|Bufwack|Oermann|2003|p=271}} Kurt Wolff commented, \"Her voice was strong and confident sort of a combination of [[Loretta Lynn]] twang and the swampy soul of [[Bobbie Gentry]].\"<ref name=\"Rough Guide\"/> Stephen L. Betts described her as a \"twangy Texan\".<ref name=\"Rolling Stone\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\nWriters and journalists have remembered Spears for songs that showed women in strong and assertive positions. Following her death, Bill Friskics-Warren of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, \"Ms. Spears rose to prominence in the late 1960s with a string of up-tempo, socially conscious songs portraying plucky survivors.\"<ref name=\"NY Times\"/> Mary A. Bufwack and Robert K. Oermann explained in their 2003 book that Spears's choice of material set her apart: \"Billie Jo was unusual for a country female of the period in that she recorded hardly any 'victim' material. Almost all of the star's hit ballads are of women leaving, surviving or otherwise asserting themselves.\"{{sfn|Bufwack|Oermann|2003|p=357}}\n\nSpears's music has been recorded by other artists and has been considered influential to other artists. [[Tammy Wynette]] was influenced by Spears's sixties-era United Artists recordings.
