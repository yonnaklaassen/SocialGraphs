She found her earliest success in their collaboration, \"Faking Love\", which was sung by [[Karen Brooks (singer)|Karen Brooks]] and [[T. G. Sheppard]], topping the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Hot Country Singles (now [[Hot Country Songs]]) charts on February 19, 1983.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/>\n\n==Career history==\nAfter her mother's death in 1985, Berg continued to have success writing songs for other performers.

It featured the single \"It's Easy to Tell,\" which charted in November 1991. The album was rejected by the label, which wanted a more mainstream-sounding recording instead.

She continued to write for others, and in 1994, released a pop album ''The Speed of Grace''.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=RCA Relays Matraca Berg's 'Stories' A Second Time|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jggEAAAAMBAJ|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=July 10, 1999}}</ref>\n\nBerg's 1995 song, \"[[You Can Feel Bad]]\", co-written with [[Tim Krekel]] and recorded by [[Patty Loveless]], was a Number 1 country single, spending twenty weeks on the charts.\n\nBerg co-wrote \"[[Strawberry Wine (Deana Carter song)|Strawberry Wine]]\" along with [[Gary Harrison (songwriter)|Gary Harrison]], which [[Deana Carter]] released as a single.
