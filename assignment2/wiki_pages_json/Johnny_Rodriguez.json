He is a [[Tejano music|Tejano]] and [[Texas country music]] singer, infusing his music with [[Latin music (genre)|Latin]] sounds, and even singing verses of songs in [[Spanish language|Spanish]].\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, he was one of country music's most successful male artists, recording a string of hit songs, such as \"[[You Always Come Back to Hurting Me]],\" \"[[Desperado (Eagles song)|Desperado]],\" \"Down on the Rio Grande\" and \"Foolin'.\" He has recorded six No. 1 country hits in his career.\n\n==Early life==\nRodriguez was born in [[Sabinal, Texas]],<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/><ref name=\"Biography Country Music Television\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/rodriguez_johnny_1_/bio.jhtml |title=CMT : Johnny Rodriguez : Biography |access-date=2007-06-20 |archive-date=2012-10-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022031735/http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/rodriguez_johnny_1_/bio.jhtml |url-status=dead }}</ref> situated 90 miles from Mexico.

He was also the captain of his [[junior high school]] [[American football|football]] team. When Rodriguez was 16 years old, his father died of cancer, and his older brother, Andres, died in an automobile accident the following year.

He sang frequently in his cell and was overheard by [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Ranger]] [[Joaquin Jackson]], who was impressed and told promoter \"Happy\" Shahan about him. (The common story told is that he was arrested after he and some friends were caught stealing and barbecuing a [[goat]], although Jackson would later state that Rodriguez was in jail simply for an unpaid fine.)<ref name=\"carthagetexas.com\"/><ref name=\"texas killing\">{{cite news |title=A Texas Killing and a Life of Triumph and Trouble |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1998-sep-23-ca-25448-story.html |first=Cary |last=Caldwell |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=September 23, 1998}}</ref>\n\nShahan then hired Johnny to perform at his local tourist attraction called the [[Alamo Village]].<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> During one of his sets in 1971, he came to the attention of country singers [[Tom T.

After performing the songs \"[[I Can't Stop Loving You]]\" and \"If I Left It Up to You,\" he was offered a contract with Mercury.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> He signed and began recording in their Nashville studio.\n\n==Career==\n{{BLP sources section|date=November 2022}}\n\n===Career in the 1970s===\nAfter signing with Mercury, his first single to be released was 1972's \"[[Pass Me By (If You're Only Passing Through)]].\"<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> This recording was a success, going to No.&nbsp;9 on the [[Hot Country Songs]] list that year. Rodriguez became the first well-known American of Mexican descent as a country singer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.classic-country-song-lyrics.com/johnnyrodriguezlyrics.html|website=Classic-country-song-lyrics.com|title=Johnny Rodriguez lyrics|access-date=2011-07-14}}</ref>\n\nIn 1972, Rodriguez was voted the 'Most Promising Vocalist' by the [[Academy of Country Music]]. The next year, he achieved his first No. 1 hit song, \"You Always Come Back to Hurting Me.\"<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> Another song that year, \"[[Ridin' My Thumb to Mexico]],\" written by Rodriguez, was also a  No. 1 hit. Both songs were listed in the [[Billboard Hot 100]].\n\nIn 1973, his debut album was released, which rose to No.&nbsp;1 on the Top Country Albums chart. He was nominated for Male Vocalist of the Year by the [[CMA Awards]]. In addition to his success in country music, he also had a role on the television show ''[[Adam-12]]'' and also made a guest appearance on ''[[The Dating Game]]'' in 1974.\n\nIn 1975, all three singles he released reached to No. 1 on the country chart: \"[[I Just Can't Get Her Out of My Mind]]\" \"[[Just Get Up and Close the Door]],\" and \"[[Love Put a Song in My Heart (song)|Love Put a Song in My Heart]].\"<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> Rodriguez's success on the country chart continued throughout much of the 1970s. He recorded songs not only written by himself around this time, but also covers of songs such as [[George Harrison]]'s \"[[Something (Beatles song)|Something]],\" [[Linda Hargrove (songwriter)|Linda Hargrove]]'s \"Just Get Up and Close the Door,\" [[Mickey Newbury]]'s \"Poison Red Berries,\" and [[Billy Joe Shaver]]'s \"Texas Up Here Tennessee.\" By 1975, Rodriguez was considered a member of the [[outlaw country]] market in country music, like fellow musicians [[Bobby Bare]] and [[Tom T. Hall]].\n\n===Career in the 1980s and 1990s and murder charge===\nDespite the outlaw movement fading from view in the late 1970s, Rodriguez was determined to stay on top of his game. In 1979, he switched to [[Epic Records]].<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> There he worked with the record producer [[Billy Sherrill]]. His first hit from Epic came that year with the No.&nbsp;6 country hit, \"Down on the Rio Grande.\" His debut album from the record company was entitled ''Rodriguez'', although all the songs from the album were cover versions.\n\nAlthough Rodriguez did not make the Top 10 continuously as in the past, he managed to stay in the Top 20, with hits like \"Fools For Each Other\" and \"What'll I Tell Virginia.\" At the same time, Rodriguez continued to be a popular concert attraction. However, Rodriguez was also having personal problems, due to his drug addiction.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> In 1982, he did a duet with [[Zella Lehr]] on the song \"Most Beautiful Girl (La Chica Mas Linda).\" The single was released by [[Columbia Records]]. In 1983, he went into the Top 5 with the hit song \"Foolin',\" followed by the Top 10 hit \"How Could I Love Her So Much.\" However, by the mid-1980s, he was becoming less successful and, in 1986, he left Epic Records.\n\nIn 1987, he signed with [[Capitol Records]] for a brief period of time. He had his last major hit in 1988 with \"I Didn't (Every Chance I Had),\"<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> which reached No.&nbsp;12 on the country chart.

In the mid-1990s, the indie label High-Tone released his album, ''You Can Say That Again''. He continued to tour around the country during this time. In 1996, he turned to another label, Paula Records, which issued \"One Bar At a Time\", but it was unsuccessful. By this time his musical presence was fading from the public view.\n\n===1998–present===\nSince 1998, Rodriguez has toured the United States and further afield including Switzerland, Poland, UK, South Korea, Canada, and Mexico. He has performed concerts at the [[Ryman Auditorium]] and [[Carnegie Hall]].\n\nRodriguez continues to tour and record new material, performing dates in the United States and Canada.

Bush]], and [[George W. Bush]]. He played at George H.W. Bush's inaugural ball.\n\nOn August 18, 2007, Rodriguez was inducted into the [[Texas Country Music Hall of Fame]], located in [[Carthage, Texas]].\n\nOn October 23, 2010, Rodriguez received the Institute of Hispanic Culture Pioneer Award,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nochedelasamericas.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=9&Itemid=12 |title=The Gala |access-date=2011-02-08 |archive-date=2011-07-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714190516/http://www.nochedelasamericas.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=9&Itemid=12 |url-status=dead }}</ref> in recognition of his accomplishment as the first major Hispanic singer in country music.\n\n==Personal life==\nRodriguez was first married to Linda Diann Patterson, a [[Southern Airways]] flight attendant from [[Conyers, Georgia]].
