Known for his baritone voice, he was known for incorporating the [[Nashville sound]] and for being one of the first artists to record a song written by Kris Kristofferson (\"Jody and the Kid\"). His highest-charting single was the No. 1 \"[[Yes, Mr. Peters]]\", a [[duet]] with [[Priscilla Mitchell]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life and career===\nDrusky was born in 1930 in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], United States.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Country Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1993|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-726-6|pages=124/5}}</ref> His mother, a church organist, had tried for years to get her son into music as a child, but he was focused more on sports, allegedly declining a contract with the [[Cleveland Indians]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfn6h2kQHxs |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211221/dfn6h2kQHxs |archive-date=2021-12-21 |url-status=live|title=roy drusky three hearts in a tangle live|access-date=August 6, 2021|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}{{cbignore}}</ref> then beginning his music career in the early 1950s performing on a [[Decatur, Georgia]] radio station. He began singing while in the US Navy during the 1940s, and later attended [[Emory University]] and studied veterinary medicine.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> During this time, he also played country music with a group he founded, the Southern Ranch Boys.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/>\n\nDrusky also worked as a disc jockey.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> In 1953, he signed with [[Starday Records]];<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> the first single he released was called \"Such a Fool\". That same year, he joined the [[Grand Ole Opry]].<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> A couple of years later, he recorded for [[Columbia Records]], but none of his work gained much success.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/>\n\n===Work as a songwriter===\n[[Faron Young]], a well-known country singer, helped Drusky's career by recording his songs.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> Two songs he wrote, \"Alone With You\" and \"[[Country Girl (Faron Young song)|Country Girl]]\", Young turned into No. 1 country hits.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> After that, Drusky moved on to [[Decca Records]]. He also wrote \"Anymore\",<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> which charted for [[Teresa Brewer]] in 1960.\n\n===Height of his career===\nDrusky charted in Cashbox with \"Wait and See\" and \"Our Church Your Wedding\" in 1959.\n\nIn 1960, Drusky finally struck it big. At Decca Records, where he worked with producer [[Owen Bradley]], he released a single called \"Another\", which he co-wrote. Bradley was a well-known producer who had led country singer [[Patsy Cline]] to big success in the early 1960s. Bradley helped smooth out Drusky's orchestral tones; the next year, Drusky reached the Country Top 10 with the single \"Second Hand Rose\".<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/>\n\nIn 1963, Drusky switched to [[Mercury Records]] and released his first hit from his new record company the same year he signed on to it. The song was called \"Peel Me a Nanner\", which was written by [[Bill Anderson (singer)|Bill Anderson]].<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> He cut a lot of duets with [[Priscilla Mitchell]]: one of his biggest hits with her was the No. 1 hit \"Yes, Mr. Peters\".<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> During his career, Drusky racked up a number of Top 40 Country hits.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/>\n\nSome of his Top 40 songs were written by famous singer-songwriters. [[Liz Anderson]] wrote \"Pick of the Week\" for him as well as \"[[(My Friends Are Gonna Be) Strangers]]\" which is best remembered by the concurrent hit by [[Merle Haggard]], although Drusky's was the more successful record at the time. [[Kris Kristofferson]] wrote \"Jody and the Kid\". Another song, \"Red, Red Wine\", was written by [[Neil Diamond]].\n\nDrusky appeared on most of the country music television programs of the era; and in 1965, he appeared in the movie ''White Lightnin' Express'' and two other films as well, ''The Golden Guitar'' and ''Four Acre Feud''.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/>\n\n===The 1970s===\nDrusky had his most successful record in several years with 1970's \"Long Long Texas Road\", a top 5 hit.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> He continued to score several top 40 country hits with the occasional low-charting single.\n\nDrusky's last top 40 country was a remake of \"[[A Satisfied Mind]]\" in 1973 which had earlier been a hit for both [[Porter Wagoner]] and [[Jean Shepard]]. He made his last appearance on the [[Billboard charts]] in 1974, but occasionally recorded on smaller record labels into the 1990s. He also recorded a number of gospel albums for [[Chapel Records]] during this period. He also returned to writing and producing music, the latter of which he had done since the 1960s.\n\nDrusky's membership with the Grand Ole Opry ensured him exposure for decades long after the radio hits stopped coming. He appeared regularly on the program until the year of his death, singing the hit songs he had racked up in the 1960s and 1970s, in addition to performing country standards from other artists, which became a tradition at the Opry.\n\n===Death===\nOn September 23, 2004, Drusky died at age 74 from complications stemming from lung cancer, which he fought for several years.<ref name=\"NYT\">{{cite news|title=Roy Drusky, Grand Ole Opry Singer, dies at 74|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/27/arts/music/roy-drusky-grand-ole-opry-singer-dies-at-74.html|date=September 27, 2004|access-date=May 12, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Personal life===\nDrusky joined the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] in 1980. He traveled and performed with Kenneth Cox Ministries for 15 years. He and his wife, Bobbye, had three sons, Roy Frank, III (\"Twig\"), Tracy Alan (\"Tad\") and Darel Bryon (\"Tip\").<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://legacy.com/us/obituaries/atlanta/name/roy-drusky-obituary?id=29806472|title=Roy Frank Drusky III|date=2004-09-29|website=[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]|access-date=2022-04-20}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
