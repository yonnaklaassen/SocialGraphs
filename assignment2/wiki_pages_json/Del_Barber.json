Originally written from the perspective of Barber's neighbor who'd lost her husband, the song's interpretation of grief has such a universal quality that even Barber ended up applying to his own life, but maybe that was its purpose all along. \"Looking back, I feel like this song was a gift from [my dad].\"<ref name=thecountrynote/></blockquote>\n\nThe release date for ''Almanac'' was announced for April 28<ref name=holler>{{Cite web|url=https://holler.country/feature/premiere-del-barber-i-told-you-so|title=Del Barber - 'I told You So' Premiere|last=Owen|first=Jof|publisher=Holler|access-date=March 14, 2023}}</ref>  Barber wrote ''Almanac'' on his farm in Inglis, Manitoba which is 400&nbsp;km northwest of Winnipeg.  He recorded the album at No Fun Club in Winnipeg.  It took one week to record the album with Grant Siemens and Scott Franchuk.<ref name=thecountrynote/>\n\n<blockquote>\"It was a really beautiful session.  There were no grand intentions, just an aim to get good players and friends together and record a pile of my songs. Going into this session I really wanted to enjoy the process, not think too hard, and just keep it simple and honest. I had a group of great songs and I really didn't want to stand in their way.\"<ref name=thecountrynote/></blockquote>\n\n==Contributions and collaborations==\nAside from his own solo work, he has writing credits on Blake Berglund and the Vultures 2014 album ''Jasper'' where he co-wrote the first six songs.
