Since the 1950s, she has recorded and released music in the genres of [[Rock music|rock]], [[Country music|country]] and [[Gospel music|gospel]]. She was among the first women to have a career in rock and roll, recording a series of 1950s singles that helped give her the [[Honorific nicknames in popular music|nickname]] \"The Queen of Rockabilly\". She is also counted among the first female stars in the genre of country music.\n\nJackson began performing as a child and later had her own radio show in Oklahoma City. She was then discovered by country singer [[Hank Thompson (musician)|Hank Thompson]], who helped her secure a recording contract with [[Decca Records]] in 1954. At Decca, Jackson had her first hit single with the country song \"[[You Can't Have My Love]]\". She then began touring the following year with [[Elvis Presley]]. The two briefly dated and Presley encouraged her to record in the [[Rockabilly]] style. In 1956, Jackson signed with [[Capitol Records]] where she was given full permission to record both country and Rockabilly. The label released a string of Jackson's rock  singles, including \"[[Fujiyama Mama]]\", \"Mean Mean Man\" and the top 40 hit \"[[Let's Have a Party]]\".\n\nIn the 1960s, Jackson moved back to the country genre and had several charting singles during the decade. This included \"[[Right or Wrong (Wanda Jackson song)|Right or Wrong]]\", \"[[In the Middle of a Heartache]]\", \"[[Tears Will Be the Chaser for Your Wine]]\" and \"[[A Woman Lives for Love]]\". In addition, she also recorded several selections for the German language market overseas. In 1965, the German single \"[[Santo Domingo (song)|Santo Domingo]]\" reached number one on the Austrian pop chart. After re-discovering [[Christianity]] in 1971, Jackson made [[gospel music]] a priority in her career. She left Capitol Records in 1973 and signed with [[Word Records]] to focus more on the gospel circuit. Over the next two decades, she released a series of gospel discs.\n\nIn 1984, Jackson was sought out by European promoters to tour overseas. The same year, she released her first rock album in two decades and launched a new career in the genre. In the 1990s, her rock records were noticed again by American audiences and she began touring alongside fellow Rockabilly artist [[Rosie Flores]]. During this period, she released several commercially acclaimed albums in the rock and roll style, including ''[[Heart Trouble (album)|Heart Trouble]]'' (2003) and ''[[I Remember Elvis]]'' (2006). Following her 2009 induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], Jackson collaborated with musician [[Jack White]] to record the commercially successful ''[[The Party Ain't Over]]''. For several years, she kept a busy touring schedule before announcing her retirement from performing in 2019. She released her 32nd and final studio project, ''[[Encore (2021 Wanda Jackson album)|Encore]]'', in 2021.\n\n==Early life==\nJackson was the only child born to parents Tom and Nellie Jackson in [[Maud, Oklahoma]].<ref name=\"Oklahoma\">{{cite web |last1=Carney |first1=George O. |title=Jackson, Wanda LaVonne: The Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture |url=https://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=JA002 |website=Oklahoma History.org |access-date=9 July 2021 |archive-date=July 9, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210709184947/https://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=JA002 |url-status=live }}</ref> Her father worked multiple jobs, including a gas station attendant and delivery truck driver.

Nellie Jackson often had Jackson sing while she was out of sight, to ensure her daughter was accounted for.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|pp=6-8}} In Los Angeles, Jackson was introduced to [[western swing]] music.{{sfn|Oermann|Bufwack|2003|p=201}} She enjoyed hearing music by popular western acts like [[Bob Wills]] and [[Rose Maddox]].{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|pp=8-10}} At age six, her father introduced Jackson to the guitar. She also took guitar lessons and was soon skillful enough to play it alongside her father.{{sfn|Oermann|Bufwack|2003|p=201}}\n\nIn the mid 1940s, the family relocated to [[Bakersfield, California]] where Tom Jackson took a job as a [[barber]]. She also took piano lessons and continued to play the guitar.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=13-15}} It was during this period that she began having trouble with academics. Jackson recalled the experience in her book: \"All I wanted to do was sing and play music, and it was impossible for me to sit still,\" she recounted in her autobiography.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=15}} When Jackson was nine, the family moved back to their home state, this time living in [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma|Oklahoma City]].<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> Her father found employment as a taxi cab driver and her mother worked on an air force base.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=13-15}}\n\nIn Oklahoma City, Jackson sang in the local Baptist church and engaged in more performance opportunities.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/>{{sfn|Oermann|Bufwack|2003|p=201}} She auditioned for the local radio station, KPLR, after being peer-pressured by friends.

I liked it,\" she explained in her biography.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=36-38}}\n\nAs a teenager, Jackson attended [[Capitol Hill High School]] in Oklahoma City<ref name=\"Oklahoman\">{{cite news |last1=Willert |first1=Tim |title=Singer Wanda Jackson among alumni to be honored by Oklahoma City school foundation |url=https://www.oklahoman.com/article/3890992/singer-wanda-jackson-among-alumni-to-be-honored-by-oklahoma-city-school-foundation |access-date=9 July 2021 |publisher=[[The Oklahoman]] |archive-date=July 9, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210709184754/https://www.oklahoman.com/article/3890992/singer-wanda-jackson-among-alumni-to-be-honored-by-oklahoma-city-school-foundation |url-status=live }}</ref> and continued her radio show.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=44}} She also dated fellow student, Leonard Sipes, who would later go by the name [[Tommy Collins (singer)|Tommy Collins]].{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=45-46}} In 1952, Jackson was heard on the air by country singer and local resident, [[Hank Thompson (musician)|Hank Thompson]].<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> The singer invited Jackson to perform with him at the Trianon Ballroom in Oklahoma City. On Thompson's show, Jackson sang \"Blue Yodel No. 6\" backed by his band the Brazos Valley Boys. The performance led to a regular gig singing alongside [[Merl Lindsay]]'s country band.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=40-44}} Jackson was always performing, and at times neglected her social life. \"[Wanda] never had time for dates, nothing like that. Just that guitar – that's all she thought about,\" a high school friend recalled.{{sfn|Oermann|Bufwack|2003|p=201}}\n\n==Career==\n===1953–1955: Country beginnings===\nJackson also continued working with Hank Thompson. In 1953, she appeared with him regularly on his local television program and on a similar program for 30 minutes hosted by KPLR. Thompson also recorded Jackson on several demonstration recordings in hopes they would be heard by major record labels. Thompson was also attempting to get his band member Billy Gray a recording contract, and had the pair sing several duets.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=59-60}} Jackson was supposed to be signed by Thompson's label, [[Capitol Records]], but was rejected by producer [[Ken Nelson (American record producer)|Ken Nelson]]. \"Girls don't sell records!\" he told Thompson.{{sfn|Wolff|2000|p=276}} In her book, Jackson recalled hearing Nelson's statement: \"I recognize that Ken wasn't being sexist, so much as he was thinking about business. But it still gave me a little nudge to prove him wrong!\"{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=59}}\n\n[[File:Wanda Jackson--1956.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Jackson was known for her spaghetti strap dresses, designed by her mother.]]\nInstead Thompson contacted [[Paul Cohen (record producer)|Paul Cohen]] of [[Decca Records]], who was interested in signing Jackson and Billy Gray.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=59-60}} In 1954, while still high school, Jackson signed with the label.{{sfn|Oermann|Bufwack|2003|p=201-202}} In March 1954, the Jackson family traveled to [[Hollywood, California]] where she recorded her first Decca sessions backed by Thompson's band. She cut several solo sides, along with the Billy Gray duet, \"[[You Can't Have My Love]]\". Jackson disliked the song, but Thompson convinced her to record it.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=60-62}} It was soon released as Jackson's debut single on Decca and became a major hit, climbing to the number eight spot on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs|Hot Country and Western Sides]] chart.<ref name=\"Whitburn Billboard\">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2008|publisher=Record Research, Inc.|year=2008|isbn=978-0-89820-177-2}}</ref> Upon Decca's encouragement, Jackson and Gray recorded a second duet, titled \"If You Don't Somebody Else Will\". Released as a single, the song was a commercial failure due to a competing version by [[Jimmy & Johnny]] that reached the charts.<ref name=\"Whitburn Billboard\" />{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=64}}\n\nInstead of touring, Jackson started her senior year in fall 1954 and finished high school. She was part of the school band and acted in the musical ''[[Anything Goes]]''.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=66-68}} In March 1955, she returned to the recording studio, this time working with Paul Cohen at the Decca studio in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. Jackson also did her first performance at the [[Grand Ole Opry]] while in town.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=69-70}} For the performance, her mother made a dress fitted with [[spaghetti strap]]s and a [[neckline|sweetheart neckline]]. Host [[Ernest Tubb]] told her it was unacceptable, so she covered it with a fringe jacket. She later recalled hearing fellow Opry members making negative comments about her while she was onstage.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Carrigan |first1=Henry |title=THE READING ROOM: Wanda Jackson's Stories Assure 'I'm Still Here' |journal=[[No Depression (magazine)|No Depression]] |date=April 4, 2019 |url=https://www.nodepression.com/the-reading-room-wanda-jacksons-stories-assure-im-still-here/ |access-date=12 July 2021 |archive-date=July 12, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210712014844/https://www.nodepression.com/the-reading-room-wanda-jacksons-stories-assure-im-still-here/ |url-status=live }}</ref> \"I decided that night that the ''Grand Ole Opry'' scene was not for me,\" she recounted.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=chapter 6}}\n\nIn 1955, Jackson graduated from Capitol Hill High School in Oklahoma City and began touring.

With Hank Thompson's help,{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=18}} she secured a new contract with Capitol Records the same year.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> At her first Capitol recording session, Jackson cut two country songs and one rock and roll selection. One song, \"[[I Gotta Know (Wanda Jackson song)|I Gotta Know]]\", incorporated elements of both country and rock. According to Jackson, the song's mixture of rock allowed her to get acquainted with the genre.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=119}} Released as a single in 1956, \"I Gotta Know\" became Jackson's second commercially successful release, peaking at number 15 on the ''Billboard'' country and western sides chart.<ref name=\"Whitburn Billboard\"/> Jackson continued recording rock and roll music under her Capitol contract and was given full permission to do so by producer Ken Nelson. Jackson also composed several of her Capitol recordings, including \"Baby Loves Him\", \"Cool Love\" and \"Mean Mean Man\".{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=123-27}} She continued recording country music as well, often putting each style on either side of a single release.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/>{{sfn|Wolff|2000|p=276}}\n\nWriters and critics have remarked positively about Jackson's recordings from the 1950s and noted their take on women's sexuality.

In addition, they commented that Jackson's rock records were \"sexually aggressive\" and demonstrated \"almost frightening savagery\".{{sfn|Oermann|Bufwack|2003|p=202}} Bruce Eder added that Jackson's material was at times \"astonishingly raucous and even raunchy\".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Eder |first1=Bruce |title=''Queen of Rockabilly'': Wanda Jackson: Songs, reviews, credits |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/queen-of-rockabilly-mw0000618189 |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=14 July 2021 |archive-date=July 14, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210714034504/https://www.allmusic.com/album/queen-of-rockabilly-mw0000618189 |url-status=live }}</ref> Meanwhile, Kurt Wolff found that Jackson's rock material was also mixed with traditional country elements, which added to her musical individuality: \"Jackson mixed straight country material and hot-to-the-core rockabilly numbers almost right from the beginning...Songs like 'Fujiyama Mama' and 'Mean Mean Man' were hard and fast, giving her plenty of reason to shimmy around in her glamorous fringe dresses\".{{sfn|Wolff|2000|p=275}}\n\nIn 1957, Jackson began working under a new booking agent, who arranged several tours in 1957 and 1958.
