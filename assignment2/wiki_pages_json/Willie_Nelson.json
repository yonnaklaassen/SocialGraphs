He was one of the main figures of the [[outlaw country]] subgenre that developed in the late 1960s as a reaction to the conservative restrictions of the [[Nashville sound]]. The critical success of his album ''[[Shotgun Willie]]'' (1973), combined with the critical and commercial success of ''[[Red Headed Stranger]]'' (1975) and ''[[Stardust (Willie Nelson album)|Stardust]]'' (1978), made Nelson one of the most recognized artists in country music. Nelson has acted in over 30 films, co-authored several books, and has been involved in activism for the use of [[biofuel]]s and the [[Legalization of non-medical cannabis in the United States|legalization of marijuana]].\n\nNelson wrote his first song at age seven and joined his first band at ten. During high school, he toured locally with the Bohemian Polka as their lead singer and guitar player. After graduating from high school in 1950, he joined the [[U.S. Air Force]] but was later discharged due to back problems. After his return, Nelson attended [[Baylor University]] for two years but dropped out because he was succeeding in music. He worked as a [[disc jockey]] at radio stations in his native Texas, and at several radio stations in the [[Pacific Northwest]], all the while working as a singer and songwriter throughout the late 1950s. During that time, he wrote songs that would become country standards, including \"[[Funny How Time Slips Away]]\", \"[[Hello Walls]]\", \"[[Pretty Paper (song)|Pretty Paper]]\", and \"[[Crazy (Willie Nelson song)|Crazy]]\". In 1960 he moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], and later signed a publishing contract with Pamper Music which allowed him to join [[Ray Price (musician)|Ray Price's]] band as a bassist. In 1962, he recorded his first album, ''[[...And Then I Wrote]]''. Due to this success, Nelson signed in 1964 with [[RCA Victor]] and joined the [[Grand Ole Opry]] the following year. After mid-chart hits in the late 1960s and the early 1970s, Nelson grew weary of the corporate Nashville music scene, and in 1972 he moved to [[Austin, Texas]]. The ongoing music scene of Austin motivated Nelson to return to performing, appearing frequently at the [[Armadillo World Headquarters]].\n\nIn 1973, after signing with [[Atlantic Records]], Nelson turned to outlaw country, including albums such as ''Shotgun Willie'' and ''Phases and Stages''. In 1975, he switched to Columbia Records, where he recorded the critically acclaimed album ''Red Headed Stranger''. The same year, he recorded another outlaw country album, ''[[Wanted! The Outlaws]]'', along with [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Jessi Colter]], and [[Tompall Glaser]]. During the mid-1980s, while creating hit albums like ''[[Honeysuckle Rose (album)|Honeysuckle Rose]]'' and recording hit songs like \"[[On the Road Again (Willie Nelson song)|On the Road Again]]\", \"[[To All the Girls I've Loved Before]]\", and \"[[Pancho and Lefty]]\", he joined the country [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[The Highwaymen (country supergroup)|The Highwaymen]], along with fellow singers [[Johnny Cash]], [[Waylon Jennings]], and [[Kris Kristofferson]]. In 1985, he helped organize the first [[Farm Aid]] concert to benefit American farmers; the concerts have been held annually ever since and Nelson has been a fixture, appearing at every one.\n\nIn 1990, Nelson's assets were seized by the [[Internal Revenue Service]], which claimed that he owed $32{{nbsp}}million. The difficulty of paying his outstanding debt was aggravated by weak investments he had made during the 1980s. In 1992, Nelson released ''[[The IRS Tapes: Who'll Buy My Memories?]]''; the profits of the double album—destined to the IRS—and the auction of Nelson's assets cleared his debt. During the 1990s and 2000s, Nelson continued touring extensively and released albums every year. Reviews ranged from positive to mixed. He explored genres such as reggae, blues, jazz, and folk.\n\nNelson made his first movie appearance in the 1979 film ''[[The Electric Horseman]]'', followed by other appearances in movies and on television. Nelson is a major [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] activist and the co-chair of the advisory board of the [[National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws]] (NORML), which is in favor of marijuana legalization. On the environmental front, Nelson owns the [[biodiesel]] brand [[Willie Nelson Biodiesel]], whose product is made from vegetable oil. Nelson is also the honorary chairman of the advisory board of the Texas Music Project, the official music charity of the state of Texas.\n\n==Early life==\n{{multiple image\n   | direction = vertical\n   | width     = 120\n   | footer    = Nelson as a junior at [[Abbott High School]] (top, pictured in 1949).

He later joined [[Johnny Bush]]'s band.\n\nNelson moved with his family to [[Pleasanton, Texas]], where he auditioned for a job as a DJ at [[KWMF|KBOP]]. The owner of the station, Dr. Ben Parker, gave Nelson the job despite his lack of experience working on radio.{{sfn|Myers|1969|p=4}} With the equipment of the station, Nelson made his first two recordings in 1955: \"[[The Storm Has Just Begun]]\" and \"When I've Sung My Last Hillbilly Song\".

On the way, Nelson stopped by the [[Esquire Ballroom]] to sell his original songs to house band singer [[Larry Butler (producer)|Larry Butler]]. Butler refused to purchase the song \"[[Mr. Record Man]]\" for $10, instead giving Nelson a $50 loan to rent an apartment and a six-night job singing in the club.{{sfn|Nelson|Shrake|Shrake|2000|p=116, 117}} Nelson rented the apartment near Houston in [[Pasadena, Texas]], where he also worked at the radio station as the sign-on disc jockey.

During this period he often spent time at [[Tootsie's Orchid Lounge]], a bar near the Grand Ole Opry frequented by the show's stars and other singers and songwriters.{{sfn|Richmond|2000|p=36}} There Nelson met [[Hank Cochran]], a songwriter who worked for the publishing company Pamper Music, owned by Ray Price and Hal Smith. Cochran heard Nelson during a jam session with [[Buddy Emmons]] and Jimmy Day. Cochran had just earned a raise of $50 a week, but convinced Smith to pay Nelson the money instead to sign him to Pamper Music. On hearing Nelson sing \"Hello Walls\" at Tootsie's, [[Faron Young]] decided to record it.{{sfn|Kosser|2006|p=[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=DL6gHNXWToQC|page=73}} 73]}} After Ray Price recorded Nelson's \"Night Life\", and his previous bassist [[Johnny Paycheck]] quit, Nelson joined Price's touring band as a bass player. While playing with Price and the [[Cherokee Cowboys]], his songs became hits for other artists, including \"[[Funny How Time Slips Away]]\" ([[Billy Walker (singer)|Billy Walker]]), \"[[Pretty Paper (song)|Pretty Paper]]\" ([[Roy Orbison]]), and, most famously, \"[[Crazy (Willie Nelson song)|Crazy]]\" by [[Patsy Cline]].{{sfn|Erlewine|1997|p=324}} Nelson and Cochran also met Cline's husband, [[Charlie Dick]] at Tootsie's. Dick liked a song of Nelson's he heard on the bar's jukebox. Nelson played him a demo tape of \"Crazy\". Later that night Dick played the tape for Cline, who decided to record it.{{sfn|Patoski|2008|p=6}} \"Crazy\" became the biggest [[jukebox]] hit of all time.{{sfn|NPR staff|1996}}\n\n[[File:Willie Nelson Grand Ole Opry publicity - cropped.jpg|upright|thumb|Nelson performing on a [[Grand Ole Opry]] package show in 1965]]\nNelson signed with [[Liberty Records]] and was recording by August 1961 at the [[Bradley Studios]] in Nashville. His first two successful singles as an artist were released by the next year, including \"[[Willingly]]\" (a duet with his soon-to-be second wife, [[Shirley Collie Nelson|Shirley Collie]], which became his first charting single and first Top Ten at No.&nbsp;10) and \"[[Touch Me (Willie Nelson song)|Touch Me]]\" (his second Top Ten, stalling at No.&nbsp;7).{{sfn|Edwards|Callahan|2001}} Nelson's tenure at Liberty yielded his first album entitled ''[[...And Then I Wrote]]'', released in September 1962.{{sfn|Bush|Mitchell|2007|p=79}} In 1963 Collie and Nelson were married in [[Las Vegas]]. He then worked on the west coast offices of Pamper Records, in [[Pico Rivera, California]]. Since the job did not allow him the time to play music of his own, he left it and bought a ranch in [[Ridgetop, Tennessee]], outside of Nashville.{{sfn|Myers|1969|p=5}} [[Fred Foster]] of [[Monument Records]] signed Nelson in early 1964, but only one single was released: \"I Never Cared For You\".{{sfn|Scobey|p=190|1982}}\n\nBy the fall of 1964, Nelson had moved to [[RCA Victor]] at the behest of [[Chet Atkins]], signing a contract for $10,000 per year.{{sfn|Reid|2004|p=[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=qCDF5fFuBT8C|224|page=224}} 224]}} ''[[Country Willie – His Own Songs]]'' became Nelson's first RCA Victor album, recorded in April 1965. That same year he joined the [[Grand Ole Opry]],{{sfn|Patoski|p=Nashville, 1960|2008|}} and he met and became friends with [[Waylon Jennings]] after watching one of his shows in [[Phoenix, Arizona]].{{sfn|Nelson|Shrake|Shrake|2000|p=158}} In 1967, he formed his backing band \"The Record Men\", featuring Johnny Bush, [[Jimmy Day]], [[Paul English (drummer)|Paul English]] and David Zettner.{{sfn|Bush|Mitchell|2007|pp=137–138}} During his first few years on RCA Victor, Nelson had no significant hits, but from November 1966 through March 1969, his singles reached the Top 25 in a consistent manner. \"One in a Row\" (#19, 1966), \"The Party's Over\" (#24 during a 16-week chart run in 1967), and his cover of [[Morecambe & Wise]]'s \"Bring Me Sunshine\" (#13, March 1969) were Nelson's best-selling records during his time with RCA.{{sfn|Dicair|2007|p=[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=MYMQl9dsKJEC|page=246}} 246]}}\n\nBy 1970, most of Nelson's songwriting royalties were invested in tours that did not produce significant profits. In addition to the problems in his career, Nelson divorced Shirley Collie in 1970. In December, his ranch in Ridgetop, Tennessee, burned down. He interpreted the incident as a signal for a change. He moved to a ranch near [[Bandera, Texas]], and married Connie Koepke. In early 1971 his single \"I'm a Memory\" reached the top 30.{{sfn|Kienzle|2003|p=[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=Gq2TTa6TStkC|page=248}} 248]}} After he recorded his final RCA single, \"Mountain Dew\" (backed with \"Phases, Stages, Circles, Cycles and Scenes\"), in late April 1972, RCA requested that Nelson renew his contract ahead of schedule, with the implication that RCA would not release his latest recordings if he did not.{{sfn|Reid|2004|p=[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=qCDF5fFuBT8C|page=223}} 223]}} Due to the failure of his albums, and particularly frustrated by the reception of ''[[Yesterday's Wine]]'', although his contract was not over, Nelson decided to retire from music.{{sfn|Nelson|Shrake|Shrake|2000|p=167}}\n\n===Outlaw country and success (1972–1989)===\nNelson moved to [[Austin, Texas]], where the burgeoning hippie music scene (see [[Armadillo World Headquarters]]) rejuvenated the singer. His popularity in Austin soared as he played his own brand of country music marked by country, folk and jazz influences.{{sfn|Reid|Sahm|2010|p=[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=1gry61absiEC|page=79}} 79]}} In March, he performed on the final day of the ''Dripping Springs Reunion'', a three-day country music festival aimed by its producers to be an annual event. Despite the failure to reach the expected attendance, the concept of the festival inspired Nelson to create the ''[[Willie Nelson's Fourth of July Picnic|Fourth of July Picnic]]'', his own annual event, starting the following year.{{sfn|Thomas|2012}}\n\nNelson decided to return to the recording business; he signed Neil Reshen as his manager to negotiate with RCA, who got the label to agree to end his contract upon repayment of $14,000.{{sfn|Reid|2004|p=[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=qCDF5fFuBT8C|page=223}} 223]}} Reshen eventually signed Nelson to [[Atlantic Records]] for $25,000 per year, where he became the label's first country artist.{{sfn|Reid|2004|p=[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=qCDF5fFuBT8C|224|page=224}}]}} He formed his backing band, ''[[Family (Willie Nelson's band)|The Family]]'',{{sfn|Milner|p=[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=zeslYkOZIvUC|page=183}} 183], [{{google books|plainurl=y|id=zeslYkOZIvUC|184|page=184}} 184]|1998}} and, by February 1973, he was recording his acclaimed ''[[Shotgun Willie]]'' at Atlantic Studios in New York City.{{sfn|Harden|Hoekstra|McCall|Morris|1996|p=169}}\n\n{{Listen |type=music |filename=Shotgun Willie.ogg|title=\"Shotgun Willie introduction\" |description=Introduction of the song \"Shotgun Willie\", opening track of the album of the [[Shotgun Willie|same name]] that marked a change of style from Nelson's earlier recordings.}}\n''Shotgun Willie'', released in May 1973, earned excellent reviews but did not sell well.

Although Columbia was reluctant to release an album with primarily a guitar and piano for accompaniment, Nelson and Waylon Jennings insisted. The album included a cover of [[Fred Rose (songwriter)|Fred Rose]]'s 1945 song \"[[Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain]]\", that had been released as a single previous to the album, and became Nelson's first number one hit as a singer.{{sfn|Wolff|Duane|2000|p=[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=3Jorozp1yp4C|page=367}} 367]}} Throughout his 1975 tour, Nelson raised funds for PBS-affiliated stations across the south promoting ''Austin City Limits''.

The first occasion was in 1974 in [[Dallas]], Texas.{{sfn|Goddard|2010}} In 1977, after a tour with Hank Cochran, Nelson traveled to [[The Bahamas]]. Nelson and Cochran arrived late to the airport and boarded the flight without luggage.{{sfn|Nelson|Ritz|2015|p=247}} The bags were later sent to them. As Nelson and Cochran claimed their luggage in the Bahamas, a customs officer questioned Nelson after marijuana was found in a pair of his jeans. Nelson was arrested and jailed. As Cochran made arrangements to pay the bail, he took Nelson a six-pack of beer to his cell.{{sfn|Nelson|Ritz|2015|p=248}} Nelson was released a few hours later. Inebriated, he fell after he jumped celebrating and was taken to the emergency room. He then appeared before the judge, who dropped the charges but ordered Nelson to never return to the country.{{sfn|Nelson|Ritz|2015|p=249}}\n\nIn 1994, [[Texas Highway Patrol|Texas Highway patrolmen]] found marijuana in his car near Waco, Texas.

He was released after paying bail of $2,500.{{sfn|Cline|2010}} Prosecutor Kit Bramblett supported not sentencing Nelson to jail due to the small amount of marijuana involved, but suggested instead a $100 fine and told Nelson that he would have him sing \"Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain\" for the court. Judge Becky Dean-Walker said that Nelson would have to pay the fine but not to perform the song, explaining that the prosecutor was joking.{{sfn|Caulfield|2011}} Nelson's lawyer Joe Turner reached an agreement with the prosecutor. Nelson was set to pay a $500 fine to avoid a two-year jail sentence with a 30-day review period, which in case of another incident would end the agreement.{{sfn|Amter|2011}} The judge later rejected the agreement, claiming that Nelson was receiving preferential treatment for his celebrity status; the offense normally carried a one-year jail sentence.{{sfn|TMZ staff|2011}} Bramblett declared that the case would remain open until it was either dismissed or the judge changed her opinion.{{sfn|Cohen|2012}}\n\n===Issues with the Internal Revenue Service===\nIn 1990, the IRS seized most of Nelson's assets, claiming that he owed $32&nbsp;million.

Later, Nelson's attorney renegotiated a settlement with the IRS in which he paid $6&nbsp;million, although Nelson did not comply with the agreement.{{sfn|Draper|1991|p=177}} Nelson released ''[[The IRS Tapes: Who'll Buy My Memories?]]'' as a double album, with all profits destined for the IRS. Many of his assets were auctioned and purchased by friends, who donated or rented his possessions to him for a nominal fee.

During the ceremony, Nelson performed the song \"[[Roll Me Up and Smoke Me When I Die]]\".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2012b}} The same year, Nelson was honored during the 46th Annual Country Music Association Awards as the first recipient of the [[Willie Nelson Lifetime Achievement Award|Lifetime Achievement Award]], which was also named after him.{{sfn|Lewis|2012}} In 2013, he received an honorary doctorate from the [[Berklee College of Music]].{{sfn|Sullivan|2013}} The following year, he was part of the inaugural class inducted into the ''Austin City Limits'' Hall of Fame.

In the April 2007 issue of [[Stuff Magazine]] Nelson was interviewed about his long locks.{{sfn|Everett|2010}} \"I started braiding my hair when it started getting too long, and that was, I don't know, probably in the 70's.\" On May 26, 2010, the Associated Press reported that Nelson had cut his hair,{{sfn|Associated Press staff|2010}} and Nashville music journalist Jimmy Carter published a photograph of the pigtail-free Nelson on his website. Nelson wanted a more maintainable hairstyle, as well helping him stay cool more easily at his Maui home.{{sfn|Carter|2010}} In October 2014, the braids of Nelson were sold for $37,000 at an auction of the Waylon Jennings estate. In 1983, Nelson cut his braids and gave them to Jennings as a gift during a party celebrating Jennings' sobriety.{{sfn|New York Post staff|2014}}\n\nNelson's touring and recording group, the Family, is full of longstanding members.
