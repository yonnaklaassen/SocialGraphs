Initially, she had planned to transform it into an [[Airbnb]] rental but changed her mind after viewing the property. Instead, Mattel decided to renovate the motel to reflect the aesthetics of her drag persona, enlisting designer Dani Dazey to collaborate on the project. The renovation process was the subject of the [[Discovery+]] original docuseries ''Trixie Motel'', which aired in 2022.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.out.com/drag/2022/3/28/trixie-mattel-spent-24-million-her-palm-springs-trixie-motel | title=Trixie Mattel Spent $2.4 Million on Her Palm Springs Trixie Motel | date=March 28, 2022 }}</ref> In 2024, Mattel and Silver produced a spin-off series, ''Trixie Motel: Drag Me Home'',  which followed the renovation of their own home.

In an interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Mattel recounted that her grandfather was a country singer who taught her how to begin playing guitar. But, growing up, she hated country music and thought it was \"old people music.\" However, she grew to love and appreciate country as an adult, recognizing its depth, complexity, and humor with artists like [[June Carter Cash]] and [[Dolly Parton]] especially contributing to her newfound appreciation. Mattel also said that she learned guitar by listening to [[George Jones]], [[Conway Twitty]], and [[Johnny Cash]]. Although she learned to play folk-country, the type of music she listened to on the radio was folk-pop from performers such as [[Jason Isbell]], [[Kris Kristofferson]], [[Aimee Mann]], [[Michelle Branch]], and [[Kacey Musgraves]].<ref>{{cite magazine |date=March 29, 2018 |title=Drag Queen Trixie Mattel on Her Country Albums, Kacey Musgraves Obsession |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/country/features/rupaul-drag-race-trixie-mattel-country-albums-kacey-musgraves-w518524 |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |access-date=April 4, 2018 |archive-date=June 16, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180616220801/https://www.rollingstone.com/country/features/rupaul-drag-race-trixie-mattel-country-albums-kacey-musgraves-w518524 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Currently, Mattel finds that her music is inspired by Miley Cyrus and Kacey Musgraves, referring to them as \"two fringe-country kindred spirits.\"<ref>{{Cite web |date=2018-04-12 |title=Country-Singing Drag Queen Trixie Mattel On Her Surprise Success: 'Country Fans Are Perceived To Be More Closed-Minded Than They Really Are' |url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/country-singing-drag-queen-trixie-mattel-on-her-surprise-success-country-fans-are-perceived-to-be-more-closed-minded-than-they-really-are_n_5acf7b24e4b0edca2cb739af |access-date=2024-07-03 |website=HuffPost |language=en}}</ref> Several of Mattel's influences for the finished version of her third studio album, ''Barbara,'' include [[The Go-Go's]], [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]], [[The B-52's]], [[Fountains of Wayne]], [[Weezer]], [[Aimee Mann]], and [[The Click Five]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=February 21, 2020 |title=An AMA About Barbara! |url=https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/f6ww20/comment/fi7qnpq/?context=3 |access-date=March 29, 2022 |website=[[Reddit]]}}</ref>\n\nMattel is also a [[DJ]], posting a remix of the [[Black Eyed Peas]] song \"My Humps\" in July 2023.<ref>{{cite web |date=July 27, 2023 |title=My Humps (Trixie Mattel Remix) |url=https://soundcloud.com/trixie-mattel/my-humps-trixie-mattel-remix\n |access-date=August 23, 2023 |website=[[Soundcloud]]}}</ref>\n\n== Personal life ==\nFirkus is [[gay]].<ref>{{cite tweet|number=888511437009698817|user=trixiemattel|title=I'm a gay person who specializes in gay activities.|date=July 21, 2017}}</ref> Since 2016, he has been in a relationship with filmmaker David Silver, who also produced his documentary ''Moving Parts''.<ref>{{Cite web |date=February 9, 2021 |title=Inside Trixie Mattel's life, her upbringing and boyfriend |url=https://www.stylesrant.com/inside-trixie-mattels-life/}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |last=Reddish |first=David |date=April 28, 2019 |title=Trixie Mattel on Katya's mental breakdown caught on film in her dragumentary, 'Moving Parts' |url=https://www.queerty.com/trixie-mattel-time-moms-boyfriend-pulled-gun-teen-queen-20190428 |magazine=Queerty |access-date=October 27, 2019}}</ref> He is a [[vegetarian]],<ref>{{cite tweet|number=610533359714893824|user=trixiemattel|title=I'm a vegetarian !|first=Trixie|last=Mattel|date=June 15, 2015|access-date=September 19, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180519175211/https://twitter.com/trixiemattel/status/610533359714893824|archive-date=May 19, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite tweet|number=1012961007453528067|user=trixiemattel|title=Triggered.
