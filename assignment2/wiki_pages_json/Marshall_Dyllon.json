These five members were recruited by country music artist [[Kenny Rogers]] and talent manager [[Lou Pearlman]], in an attempt to bring the [[boy band]] sound to the country music scene.\n\nExcluding Kenny Rogers himself, Marshall Dyllon was the first act to be signed to Dreamcatcher Records, an independent label which Rogers owned. The group's singular album, ''[[Enjoy the Ride (Marshall Dyllon album)|Enjoy the Ride]]'', was released that year. It accounted for the chart singles \"Live It Up\" and \"You\". The band released a third single, \"[[She Ain't Gonna Cry]]\", in 2001 before disbanding.\n\n==Biography==\n[[Lou Pearlman]], the talent manager responsible for the [[Backstreet Boys]] and [['N Sync]], teamed up with country music artist [[Kenny Rogers]] to create the lineup of Marshall Dyllon as an attempt to bring the then-popular [[boy band]] sound to the country music scene.<ref name=\"cnn\"/> Rogers and Lou found Paul Martin, Michael Martin (Paul's younger brother), Dan Cahoon, Todd Sansom, and Jesse Littleton.
