His motion picture debut was in ''[[Song of the Gringo]]'' (1936) for [[Grand National Pictures]].<ref name=cmhf2 />  He went on to appear in 70 movies as an actor, and 76 on movie soundtracks.

He was the first artist signed with the newly formed [[Capitol Records]] in 1942.<ref name=cmhf />\n\nIn 1944, he scored a hit with \"[[I'm Wastin' My Tears on You]]\", which hit number one on the country chart and number 11 on the pop chart. An article in the trade publication ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' noted 14 years later that with that song, he \"reached the style of rhythmic tune that would assure his musical stature\".<ref name=\"ges\">{{cite magazine|title=Golden Era of Success|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oyIEAAAAMBAJ&q=%22Tex+Ritter%22&pg=PA46|access-date=December 26, 2016|magazine=Billboard|date=December 7, 1968|page=46}}</ref>\n\nIn 1952 Ritter recorded \"[[The Ballad of High Noon]]\" for the film ''[[High Noon]]''.

In 1953, he began performing on ''[[Town Hall Party]]'' on radio and television in Los Angeles. In 1957, he co-hosted ''Ranch Party'', a syndicated version of the show. He made his national TV debut in 1955 on ABC-TV's ''[[Ozark Jubilee]]'' and was one of five rotating hosts for its 1961 NBC-TV spin-off, ''[[Five Star Jubilee]]''.\n\n=== Later work ===\nRitter became one of the founding members of the [[Country Music Association]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], and spearheaded the effort to build the [[Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum]] into which he was inducted in 1964.<ref name=\"cmhf2\">{{cite web|title=Tex Ritter|url=http://countrymusichalloffame.org/artists/artist-detail/tex-ritter|website=Country Music Hall of Fame|access-date=December 26, 2016}}</ref>\n\nHe moved to Nashville in 1965 and began working for radio station [[WSM (AM)|WSM]] and the [[Grand Ole Opry]], earning a lifetime membership in the latter in 1970.<ref name=cmhf2 />\n\n== Senate campaign ==\nIn 1970, Ritter entered Tennessee's Republican primary election for United States Senate. Despite high name recognition, he lost the nomination to United States Representative [[Bill Brock]], who then defeated the incumbent Senator [[Albert Gore, Sr]]. in the general election.\n\n== Personal life ==\n[[File:Tex Ritter grave marker Port Neches Texas.jpg|thumb|Ritter's grave marker in [[Port Neches, Texas|Port Neches]] in [[Jefferson County, Texas|Jefferson County]], [[Texas]]]]\n\nRitter died of a heart attack in Nashville on January 2, 1974, at age 68. He was survived by his wife and two sons.  Ritter's son, John, became famous as an actor, playing [[Jack Tripper]] on the ABC sitcom ''[[Three's Company]]'' (1977–1984). In 2003, John died, at the age of 54, of an [[aortic dissection]]. Because John was initially diagnosed as having a heart attack, and because aortic dissection is known to be hereditary, the family now believes that Tex died of an aortic dissection rather than a heart attack.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://abc13.com/archive/7256482/|title=Actor John Ritter's wife brings message of awareness to condition that led to his death |website=Abc13.com|access-date=January 25, 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\nFor his contribution to the recording industry, Ritter has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6631 [[Hollywood Boulevard]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Tex Ritter|url=http://www.walkoffame.com/tex-ritter|website=Hollywood Walk of Fame|access-date=December 26, 2016}}</ref> In 1980, he was inducted into the [[Western Performers Hall of Fame]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Great Western Performers|url=http://nationalcowboymuseum.org/awards-halls-of-fame/great-western-performers-2/|website=National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum|access-date=December 26, 2016|archive-date=July 11, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150711035714/http://nationalcowboymuseum.org/awards-halls-of-fame/great-western-performers-2/|url-status=dead}}</ref> at the [[National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum]] in [[Oklahoma City]], [[Oklahoma]].
