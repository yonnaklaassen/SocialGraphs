The album included the back-to-back number one singles \"[[There Is No Arizona]]\" and \"[[When I Think About Angels]]\". Two other singles were released: the title track, which reached No.&nbsp;21 on the country charts, and \"Frantic\", which reached No.&nbsp;41 in 2002. She released her second studio album, ''[[Brave (Jamie O'Neal album)|Brave]]'', in 2005 with singles Trying to Find Atlantis which reached number 17 and Somebody’s Hero which reached number 3. O’Neal’s third studio album, ''[[Eternal (Jamie O'Neal album)|Eternal]]'', was released on 27 May 2014.\n\n==Early life==\nO'Neal was born '''Jamie Murphy''' in Sydney, to parents Jimmy and Julie Murphy, who were also professional musicians. She, her parents, and her younger sister, Samantha, sang in The Murphy Family band in the 1970s until her parents divorced. In the early part of her adult career she was a backing singer in Australia, appearing on [[Kylie Minogue]]'s [[Enjoy Yourself Tour]] of Australia, UK, Europe and Far East Asia in 1990. She rejoined Minogue in 1991 for the [[Let's Get To It Tour]] of the UK and Ireland.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://music.apple.com/us/artist/jamie-oneal/70012|title=Jamie O'Neal on Apple Music|website=Music.apple.com}}</ref>\n\n== Music career ==\n=== 2000–2003: ''Shiver''  and  ''Brave'' ===\nO'Neal was signed to [[Universal Music Group Nashville#Mercury Nashville|Mercury Nashville]] in 2000, and soon  began to work on her first album. Her first single, \"[[There Is No Arizona]]\", debuted at No.&nbsp;69 on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Singles & Tracks]] (now [[Hot Country Songs]]) chart, reaching number one in February 2001. On 31 October 2000, ''[[Shiver (Jamie O'Neal album)|Shiver]]'', was released. The album charted to No.&nbsp;14 on the ''Billboard'' [[Top Country Albums]] chart, and No.&nbsp;125 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].\n\nA second single, \"[[When I Think About Angels]]\", debuted at No.&nbsp;45 on the country charts for the week of 31 March 2001. It spent several weeks on the charts, reaching number one in August 2001. Following the success of the album's first two singles, ''Shiver'' was certified Gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]. Two additional singles followed: \"Shiver\" (the title track) and \"Frantic\", which reached No.&nbsp;21 and No.&nbsp;41 on the charts, respectively.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jamieoneal.com/|title=Jamie O'Neal|website=Jamieoneal.com}}</ref>\n\nAlso in 2001, the motion picture ''[[Bridget Jones's Diary (film)|Bridget Jones's Diary]]'' featured a cover version of \"[[All by Myself]]\" performed by Jamie O'Neal,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0243155/soundtrack|title=Bridget Jones's Diary (2001) – IMDb|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref> showing actress [[Renée Zellweger]] singing to it in the famous pajamas scene.\n\nIn 2002, O'Neal and the country singer [[Mark Wills]] recorded a duet together, titled \"I'm Not Gonna Do Anything Without You\". It was released as the second single from Wills' album ''[[Loving Every Minute (album)|Loving Every Minute]]''. The song only reached No.&nbsp;31 on the Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart.\n\nO'Neal's fifth single, \"[[Every Little Thing (Jamie O'Neal song)|Every Little Thing]]\", was the first from what was to be her second studio album, ''On My Way to You''. However, the song only managed to reach No.&nbsp;34 on the Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart, and the album was never released. Shortly thereafter, O'Neal and Mercury parted ways. O'Neal went on to sign to Capitol Records and released the album ''Brave''.\n\n=== 2004–2007: ''Brave'' and \"God Don't Make Mistakes\" ===\n[[File:Jamie O'Neal.jpg|left|thumb|O'Neal at the Maverick Saloon in Santa Ynez, California]]\n\nAfter leaving Mercury, O'Neal signed to [[Capitol Records Nashville|Capitol Nashville]]. Her first single for the label, \"[[Trying to Find Atlantis]]\", was released on 27 September 2004. It reached No.&nbsp;18 on the Hot Country Songs chart. The song was the lead-off to ''[[Brave (Jamie O'Neal album)|Brave]]'', which was released on 1 March 2005. It proved to be a bigger success on the albums chart, reaching No.&nbsp;6 on the Top Country Albums chart.\n\n\"[[Somebody's Hero (song)|Somebody's Hero]]\" was released in 2005 as the second single and reached No.&nbsp;3 on the Hot Country Songs chart, giving O'Neal her first Top 10 single since 2001. The final single, \"I Love My Life\", failed to make the Top 20, reaching only No.&nbsp;26.\n\nIn early 2007, a new single, \"God Don't Make Mistakes\", was released. The single failed to make an impact at country radio, where it only reached No.&nbsp;47, her lowest chart single at the time. After the song was never included on an album, O'Neal and Capitol parted ways.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/news-in-brief/1564131/jamie-oneal-capitol-nashville-part-ways.jhtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606191711/http://www.cmt.com/news/news-in-brief/1564131/jamie-oneal-capitol-nashville-part-ways.jhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=6 June 2011|title=Jamie O'Neal, Capitol Nashville part ways|work=[[Country Music Television]]|date=5 July 2007|access-date=25 July 2009}}</ref>\n\n=== 2008–2010: ''Like a Woman'' ===\nIn early 2008, O'Neal signed with the Atlanta-Nashville based record label 1720 Entertainment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1585038/country-labels-keep-rosters-full-despite-album-sales-dip.jhtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411032354/http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1585038/country-labels-keep-rosters-full-despite-album-sales-dip.jhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=11 April 2008|title=Country labels keep rosters full despite album sales dip|work=Country Music Television|date=8 April 2008|access-date=25 July 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/news-in-brief/1584578/rebecca-lynn-howard-jamie-oneal-sign-with-independent-labels.jhtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226203142/http://www.cmt.com/news/news-in-brief/1584578/rebecca-lynn-howard-jamie-oneal-sign-with-independent-labels.jhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=26 February 2009|title=Rebecca Lynn Howard, Jamie O'Neal sign with independent labels|work=Country Music Television|date=1 April 2008|access-date=25 July 2009}}</ref>\n\nA new single, \"Like a Woman\", was released in November 2008; it debuted on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Songs]] chart at No.&nbsp;59.
