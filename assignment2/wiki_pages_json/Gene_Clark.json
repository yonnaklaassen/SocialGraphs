It included such enduring songs as \"Train Leaves Here This Morning\" (a collaboration between Clark and Leadon prominently covered by the latter in 1972 on The Eagles' [[Eagles (album)|debut album]]) and \"She Darked the Sun\" (covered by [[Linda Ronstadt]] on her 1970 album ''[[Silk Purse (Linda Ronstadt album)|Silk Purse]]''). In contrast, ''Through the Morning, Through the Night'' was more indebted to [[traditional bluegrass]] but also employed electric instrumentation. By this juncture, Dillard's girlfriend Donna Washburn had joined the group as a backing vocalist, a factor that precipitated the departure of Leadon.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=147}}</ref> The shift to traditional bluegrass also caused Clark to lose interest.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=149}}</ref> Written by Clark, the title song was used by [[Quincy Jones]] in the soundtrack of the 1972 [[Sam Peckinpah]] film ''[[The Getaway (1972 film)|The Getaway]]''; it was also covered by [[Robert Plant]] and [[Alison Krauss]] (along with \"Polly,\" another Clark-penned track from the album) on their 2007 album ''[[Raising Sand]]''.

While the album charted relatively well (U.S. No. 20), its placement did not live up to the label's initial expectations in the wake of the recent success of Crosby ([[Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young]]) and Hillman (a member of [[Stephen Stills]]'s band [[Manassas (band)|Manassas]]). Clark's compositions \"[[Full Circle Song|Full Circle]]\" and \"Changing Heart\" and the [[Neil Young]] covers on which he sang the lead vocal (\"See the Sky About to Rain\" and \"Cowgirl in the Sand\") were widely regarded as the standout tracks on the critically divisive album.<ref name=\"Einarson 2005 182\">{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-95295-401-X|page=182}}</ref> Disheartened by the bad reviews and unhappy with Crosby's performance as the record's producer, the group members chose to dissolve the band.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rogan|first=Johnny|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited, the Sequel|year=2008|publisher=Rogan House|location=London|isbn=978-0-95295-401-9|page=354}}</ref> Clark briefly joined McGuinn's solo group, with which he premiered \"Silver Raven\", arguably his most celebrated post-Byrds song.<ref name=\"Einarson 2005 182\"/>\n\n===''No Other''===\nOn the basis of the quality of Clark's contributions to ''Byrds'', [[David Geffen]] signed him to Asylum Records in early 1974.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rogan|first=Johnny|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited The Sequel|year=2008|publisher=Rogan House|location=London England|isbn=978-0-95295-401-9|page=369}}</ref> The label was the home of the most prominent exponents of the singer-songwriter movement of the era and carried the kind of hip cachet that Clark hadn't experienced since his days with the Byrds.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hoskyns|first=Barney|title=Hotel California: The True Life Adventures of Crosby, Stills, Nash, Young, Mitchell, Taylor, Browne, Ronstadt, Geffen, the Eagles and Their Many Friends|year=2006|publisher=Wiley & Sons, Inc.|location=Hoboken, New Jersey|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=140}}</ref> While composing the album, he spent long periods with a notebook and an acoustic guitar at the picture window of his home, deriving inspiration from staring at the Pacific Ocean.\n\nProduced by [[Thomas Jefferson Kaye]] with a vast array of session musicians (including members of [[The Section (band)|The Section]] and the [[The Allman Brothers Band|Allman Brothers Band]]) and backing singers, the ensuing ''[[No Other]]'' fused elements of country rock, folk, gospel, soul and choral music with poetic, mystical lyrics.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rogan|first=Johnny|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited The Sequel|year=2008|publisher=Rogan House|location=London England|isbn=978-0-95295-401-9|page=488}}</ref> Although the album was praised by critics, its unconventional arrangements (which anticipated the later innovations of [[Lindsey Buckingham]], [[Stevie Nicks]] and [[Christine McVie]])<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/no-other-mw0000202963|title=No Other – Gene Clark – Songs, Reviews, Credits – AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=June 21, 2018}}</ref> limited public appeal.

Throughout 1975 and 1976, he had hinted to the press that he was assembling a set of \"cosmic\" songs fusing country rock with [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] and [[funk]], elaborating on the soundscapes of his most recent album. In 1976, he recorded a set of ten demos that combined country and folk music with a light touch of cosmic consciousness. These were submitted to [[RSO Records]], which promptly bought out Clark's Asylum contract and issued the long-gestating ''[[Two Sides to Every Story]]'' in 1977. The album—a melange of bluegrass, traditional [[honky tonk]], echoes of ''No Other'' (\"Sister Moon\") and strident country rock (a new arrangement of \"Kansas City Southern\")—was produced by Kaye with an understated touch.<ref name=\"Rogan 2008 370\">{{cite book|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited The Sequel|last=Rogan|first=Johnny|publisher=Rogan House|year=2008|isbn=978-0-95295-401-9|location=London England|page=370}}</ref>\n\nThe emotional fallout from his divorce is reflected in the album title and several of Clark's compositions, including the aforementioned \"Sister Moon\", \"Lonely Saturday\", \"Past Addresses\", \"Silent Crusade\" and \"Hear the Wind\". The album also contains covers of the traditional \"In the Pines\" (a key component of Clark's live repertoire with the Silverados) and \"Give My Love to Marie\" by [[James Talley]]. Once again, his style of sensitive balladry failed to achieve success on the U.S. charts. In a belated attempt to find an appreciative public, he reluctantly overcame his travel anxiety and launched an international promotional tour with the KC Southern Band.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rogan|first=Johnny|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited The Sequel|year=2008|publisher=Rogan House|location=London England|isbn=978-0-95295-401-9|pages=490–491}}</ref> Some six weeks before his death in 1991, Clark told interviewer [[Bill Wasserzieher]] that he considered ''Two Sides to Every Story'' his best album, rivaled only by ''No Other''.<ref>Wasserzieher, Bill.

He wrote four songs for the album, including \"Backstage Pass\" (a rumination on the ennui of touring and his fear of flying), \"Release Me Girl\" (a [[disco]]-inflected collaboration with [[Thomas Jefferson Kaye]]), the [[UFO]]-inspired \"Feelin' Higher\" and \"Little Mama\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Rogan|first=Johnny|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited The Sequel|year=2008|publisher=Rogan House|location=London England|isbn=978-0-95295-401-9|pages=385–387}}</ref>\n\nMany critics felt that the album's slick production and [[disco]]-influenced [[soft rock]] rhythms didn't flatter the group, but the album reached No. 39 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] (underpinned by the McGuinn-penned \"Don't You Write Her Off\", which peaked at No. 33 in May 1979) and earned a [[RIAA]] gold certification, selling well enough to generate a follow-up.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/310280/mcguinn-clark-hillman/chart|title=McGuinn, Clark & Hillman – Chart history|publisher=Billboard|date=May 12, 1979|access-date=October 14, 2015}}</ref> McGuinn, Clark and Hillman's second release was to have been a full group effort entitled ''City''; although it was ultimately released in 1980, a combination of Clark's unreliability (including experimentation with heroin) and his dissatisfaction with their musical direction (mostly regarding Ron and Howard Albert's production) resulted in the album being credited to \"Roger McGuinn & Chris Hillman featuring Gene Clark.\" Despite the turmoil, Clark penned the song \"Won't Let You Down\".

Their effort failed this time; Clark was not included in the reunion, primarily because of his involvement with the act that didn't include them.
