(BMI). The company initially focused on managing music created by Franks and his collaborators. While Franks has written songs for larger publishing companies such as Lowery Music Group, Chris White Music, and Chestnut Mound Publishing, he continues to write for Peach Picked Publishing. One of his compositions, \"Filling the River with Tears,\" was recorded by David Davis and the Warrior River Boys.\nOver time, Peach Picked Publishing expanded its catalog to include works from various artists, including Bluegrass Hall of Fame members Chubby Wise and Curly Seckler, and Georgia Music Hall of Fame member Cotton Carrier. The company has also managed recordings by artists such as [[Marty Stuart]], [[Ralph Stanley]], and [[The Grateful Dead]].\nFranks later formed Randall Franks Music to manage publishing and music catalogs for other artists. Through this venture, he has assisted artists in negotiating royalties from film, television, and other sources worldwide.
