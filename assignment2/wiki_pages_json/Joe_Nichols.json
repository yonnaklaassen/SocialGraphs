At age 19, he was signed to his first record deal, with an independent label known as [[Intersound Records]]. There, Nichols released his first album, 1996's ''[[Joe Nichols (album)|Joe Nichols]]''. Despite the minor success of its lead-off single \"Six of One, Half a Dozen of the Other\" (which reached No.&nbsp;74 on the ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' country charts in [[Canada]]), the album sold poorly and he was dropped from Intersound's roster.
