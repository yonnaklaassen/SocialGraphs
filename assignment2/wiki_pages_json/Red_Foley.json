His 1951 hit, \"[[Peace in the Valley]]\", was among the first million-selling [[gospel music|gospel]] records. A [[Grand Ole Opry]] veteran until his death, Foley also hosted the first popular country music series on network television, ''[[Ozark Jubilee]]'', from 1955 to 1960.\n\nHe is a member of the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]], which called him \"one of the most versatile and moving performers of all time\" and \"a giant influence during the formative years of contemporary Country music.\"\n\n==Biography==\nFoley was born on a {{convert|24|acre|ha|adj=on}} farm in [[Blue Lick, Kentucky]],<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> and grew up nearby [[Berea, Kentucky|Berea]]. He gained the nickname Red for his hair color. He was born into a musical family, and by the time he was nine was giving impromptu concerts at his father's general store, playing French harp, piano, banjo, trombone, harmonica and guitar. At 17, he won first prize in a statewide talent show. He graduated from Berea High School, and later worked as a $2-a-show usher and singer at a theater in [[Covington, Kentucky]]. Foley was of [[Irish people|Irish]] ancestry<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://irishamerica.com/2012/01/roots-the-foley-family/|title=Roots: The Foley Family |website=Irishamerica.com|date=January 26, 2012 |access-date=August 6, 2021}}</ref>\n\n===Early radio and recording career===\nIn 1930, as a freshman at [[Georgetown College (Kentucky)|Georgetown College]], Foley was chosen by a talent scout from Chicago's [[WLS (AM)|WLS-AM]] to sing with producer John Lair's Cumberland Ridge Runners, the house band on ''[[National Barn Dance]]''. His first single, \"Life is Good Enough for Me / The Lone Cowboy\", was released in June 1933 on the [[Melotone Records (US)|Melotone]] label. In 1937 he returned to Kentucky with Lair to help establish the ''[[Renfro Valley Barn Dance]]'' stage and radio show near [[Mt. Vernon, Kentucky|Mt. Vernon]] in 1939, performing everything from ballads to [[boogie-woogie]] to [[blues]]. In late 1939, Foley became the first country artist to host a network radio program, [[NBC Red Network|NBC]]'s ''Avalon Time'' (co-hosted by [[Red Skelton]]), and he performed extensively at theaters, clubs and fairs. He then returned for another seven-year stint with ''National Barn Dance''.\n\nIn 1941, the same year he made his first of only two [[Cinema of the United States|film]] appearances (portraying himself) with [[Tex Ritter]] in the [[western (genre)|Western]], ''The Pioneers'', Foley signed a lifetime contract with [[Decca Records]]. He also released \"[[Old Shep (song)|Old Shep]]\" in 1941, a song he wrote with Arthur Willis in 1933 about a dog he owned as a boy (in reality, his [[German shepherd]], poisoned by a neighbor, was named Hoover). The song, later recorded by many artists including [[Hank Snow]] and [[Elvis Presley]], became a country classic.<ref name=\"Red Foley Fans Tribute\">{{cite web|url=http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendid=416559146|title=Red Foley Fans Tribute|website=Myspace.com|access-date=2009-03-14|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115031809/http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile|archive-date=January 15, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref> His patriotic 1944 single, \"[[Smoke On The Water (Red Foley song)|Smoke on the Water]]\", topped the folk records chart for 13 consecutive weeks, and on January 17, 1945, Foley was the first country performer to record in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. During the session at [[WSM (AM)|WSM-AM]]'s Studio B, he recorded \"[[Tennessee Saturday Night]]\", \"Blues in My Heart\" and \"Tennessee Border\". He soon became known for such songs as \"The Death of Floyd Collins\" and \"The Sinking of the Titanic\".<ref>The Associated Press (September 21, 1968) \"Red Foley Dead; Country Singer\", ''[[The New York Times]]'', p. 33</ref> He moved to Nashville in 1946 and was briefly a member of the Brown's Ferry Four, recording \"Jesus Hold My Hand\" and \"I'll Meet You in the Morning\".\n\n===Mr. Country Music===\nIn April 1946, Foley signed on to emcee and perform on ''The Prince Albert Show'', the segment of the ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'' carried on [[NBC Red Network|NBC Radio]]. During the next eight years he established himself as one of the most respected and versatile performers in country music. He acted as master of ceremonies, the straight man for Opry comedians [[Rod Brasfield]] and [[Minnie Pearl]], and proved himself a vocalist who could handle all types of material.<ref name=\"Red Foley Fans Tribute\"/> His popularity was credited with establishing the Opry as America's top country music radio show. In 1949, Foley was part of the Opry's first European tour, visiting U.S. military bases in England, West Germany and the Azores, with Brasfield, [[Roy Acuff]], Minnie Pearl, [[Little Jimmy Dickens]], [[Hank Williams]] and others.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of the Opry|work=Grand Ole Opry|publisher=Gaylord Entertainment|url=http://opry.com/about/index.html|access-date=2010-01-26|archive-date=July 27, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160727231806/http://www.opry.com/about/index.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nFoley began recording with his backing group, the Cumberland Valley Boys, in 1947. He recorded seven top five hits with the group between 1947 and 1949, including a No.&nbsp;1 single, \"[[New Jolie Blonde (New Pretty Blonde)]]\" (a cover of a 1946 [[Moon Mullican]] hit), and the country boogie anthem \"[[Tennessee Saturday Night]]\", a chart-topper in 1948. In 1950, he had three million-sellers: \"[[Just a Closer Walk with Thee (song)|Just a Closer Walk with Thee]]\", \"[[Steal Away]]\" (recorded by Hank Williams as \"The Funeral\"), and a solo version of the song that became his trademark, \"[[Chattanoogie Shoe Shine Boy]]\".<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\">{{cite book\n| first= Joseph\n| last= Murrells\n| year= 1978\n| title= The Book of Golden Discs\n| edition= 2nd\n| publisher= Barrie and Jenkins Ltd\n| location= London\n| page= [https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/50 50]\n| isbn= 0-214-20512-6\n| url-access= registration\n| url= https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/50\n}}</ref> Featuring guitarist [[Grady Martin]], it stayed at No.&nbsp;1 on ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'s'' [[Hot Country Songs|country chart]] for 13 weeks and hit the pop chart as well.\n\nIn April 1951, Foley was pleased when the popular [[Andrews Sisters]] (Patty, Maxene, and LaVerne) flew from Hollywood to Nashville to join him for a two-day recording session, both acts hoping to repeat the previous successes that the sisters enjoyed when they teamed with [[Burl Ives]] in 1947 and [[Ernest Tubb]] in 1949, producing both folk and country hits. While the results proved to be less popular, the ten tunes recorded were vocally well-executed and received a good deal of play on the country radio stations. The songs included the rhythmic \"Satins and Lace\", the rockabilly-flavored novelty \"Where Is Your Wandering Mother Tonight?\", a very slow rendering of the forlorn hillbilly classic \"[[Bury Me Beneath the Willow]]\", two duets by Foley and Patty Andrews, and two country gospel favorites: \"[[It Is No Secret (What God Can Do)]]\" and \"He Bought My Soul at Calvary\".<ref>Sforza, John: \"Swing It! The Andrews Sisters Story;\" University Press of Kentucky, 2000; 289 pages</ref>\n\nIn 1951, Foley's second wife, Judy Martin, took her own life. To devote more time to his family in Nashville, he cut back on performing but continued to release hits in a variety of styles, including [[rockabilly]] and [[rhythm and blues]]. His 1951 hit, [[Peace in the Valley|\"(There'll Be) Peace in the Valley (for Me)\"]] backed by the Sunshine Boys quartet, was one of the first [[gospel music]] records to sell one million copies. He also released his first LP that year, ''Souvenir Album'' (Decca DL-5303).\n\nFoley's manager was Jim McConnell and \"Dub\" Albritton was his personal appearances manager. Starting in 1951, he hosted ''The Red Foley Show'' on Saturday afternoons on [[NBC#Defining radio's golden age|NBC Radio]] from Nashville (moving to [[Citadel Media|ABC Radio]] and [[Springfield, Missouri]] from 1956 to 1961) sponsored by [[Dow Chemical]]. On November 21, 1953, he was one of the first eight singers named to ''Billboard'' magazine's Honor Roll of Country and Western artists, \"named by the disk jockeys of America as an all-time great of country & western music.\"<ref>\"Honor Roll of C&W Artists\" (December 5, 1953) ''[[Billboard (magazine)|The Billboard]]'', p. 48</ref>\n\nFoley never lost his love for country music and, unlike [[Eddy Arnold]], never sought success as a pop artist, even though many of his recordings made the pop charts.<ref name=\"Red Foley Fans Tribute\"/> Other hits included \"[[Sugarfoot Rag]]\", \"Cincinnati Dancing Pig\" and \"[[Birmingham Bounce]]\", which stayed at No.&nbsp;1 for 14 weeks. Foley's success with the song prompted 21 cover versions. \"One By One\", a duet with [[Kitty Wells]], hit No.&nbsp;1 in 1954 and stayed on the charts for 41 weeks. He also recorded with [[Ernest Tubb]] (with whom he maintained a fictitious on-air \"feud\"), the Dixie Dons, the [[Anita Kerr Singers]], [[Rosetta Tharpe]], Evelyn Knight and the [[Lawrence Welk]] Orchestra. Known by then as Mr. Country Music and America's Favorite Country Gentleman, critics dubbed him the \"barnyard [[Bing Crosby]]\".<ref>Dessauer, Phil \"Springfield, Mo.-Radio City of Country Music\" (April 1957), ''[[Coronet (magazine)|Coronet]]'', p. 154</ref>\n\n===Television career===\n[[File:Red Foley.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Foley c. 1956]]After several years in virtual retirement, Foley moved to Springfield, Missouri in July 1954 after music executive [[Si Siman]] convinced him to host ''[[Ozark Jubilee]]'' on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC-TV]] and [[Citadel Media|radio]].

He appeared in the 1966 film musical, ''Sing a Song, for Heaven's Sake'', and was a guest on ''[[The Joey Bishop Show (talk show)|The Joey Bishop Show]]'' on August 24, 1967.\n\nFoley was elected to the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] in 1967 (the first Kentuckian and one of only six then-living inductees), which honored him as \"one of the most versatile and moving performers of all time\" and \"a giant influence during the formative years of contemporary Country music and today a timeless legend.\"\n\n===Death===\nOn September 19, 1968, Foley appeared in two Opry performances in [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]], sponsored by the local Sheriff's Posse<ref>\"Red Foley, a Country Great, is Found Dead\" September 1968 ''Billboard''</ref> that included [[Billy Walker (musician)|Billy Walker]] and 19-year-old [[Hank Williams, Jr.]], son of his long-time friend [[Hank Williams]]. Williams Jr. noted that Foley was somewhat slower than usual that day and had no appetite. Before the second show, according to Walker, Foley came to his dressing room and Walker shared his faith in [[Jesus|Christ]]: Foley said, \"Do you think God could ever forgive a sinner like me?\" He began to tell me all the rotten things he had done in his life, and I looked him in the face and said, \"Red, if God can forgive me, He can forgive you.\" I prayed with Red. He went out, and the last song he sang was \"Peace in the Valley\". He came over to side of the stage and said, 'Billy, I've never sung that song and feel the way I do tonight.'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billywalker.com|title=In Memory of Billy Walker|publisher=The estate of Billy Walker|access-date=2009-04-17}}</ref> Foley suffered [[acute pulmonary edema|respiratory failure]] that night and died in his sleep, prompting Hank Williams, Jr. to write and record (as [[Luke the Drifter#Luke the Drifter|Luke the Drifter]], Jr.) \"I Was With Red Foley (The Night He Passed Away\").<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> According to the song, which charted that November, his [[last words]] were, \"I'm awful tired now, Hank.
