An [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-nominated documentary director and a [[Grammy Awards|Grammy Award]]-winning recording artist, she is known for her eclectic tastes in the material she records (which has included [[folk music]], [[country music|country]], [[show tune]]s, [[pop music]], [[rock and roll]] and [[Traditional pop|standards]]), for her [[social activism]], and for the clarity of her voice. [[Judy Collins discography|Her discography]] consists of 36 studio albums, nine live albums, numerous compilation albums, four holiday albums, and 21 [[single (music)|singles]].\n\nCollins' debut studio album, ''[[A Maid of Constant Sorrow]]'', was released in 1961 and consisted of traditional [[Folk music|folk songs]]. She had her first charting single with \"Hard Lovin' Loser\" (No. 97) from her fifth studio album ''[[In My Life (Judy Collins album)|In My Life]]'' (1966), but it was the [[lead single]] from her sixth studio album ''[[Wildflowers (Judy Collins album)|Wildflowers]]'' (1967), \"[[Both Sides, Now]]\" – written by [[Joni Mitchell]] – that gave her international prominence. The single reached No. 8 on the [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] [[Billboard Hot 100|Pop Singles chart]]<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/305342/judy-collins/chart |title=Judy Collins – Chart history |magazine=Billboard |access-date=July 30, 2015}}</ref> and won Collins her first [[Grammy Awards|Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Ethnic or Traditional Folk Recording|Best Folk Performance]].<ref name=\"Gram\">{{cite news |publisher=National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences |url=https://www.grammy.com/artists/judy-collins/12213 |title=Judy Collins |access-date=January 19, 2021}}</ref> She enjoyed further success with her recordings of \"[[Someday Soon (Ian Tyson song)|Someday Soon]]\", \"[[Chelsea Morning]]\" (also written by Mitchell), \"[[Amazing Grace]]\", \"[[Turn!

The single peaked at No. 36 on the ''Billboard'' Pop Singles chart in 1975 and then again in 1977 at No. 19, spending 27 non-consecutive weeks on the chart and earning her a Grammy Award nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance|Best Pop Vocal Performance, Female]], as well as a Grammy Award for Sondheim for [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]].<ref>{{cite news |publisher=National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences |url=https://www.grammy.com/artists/stephen-sondheim/12557 |title=Stephen Sondheim |access-date=January 19, 2021}}</ref> ''Judith'' also became her best-selling studio album; it was certified [[Music recording certification|Gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] in 1975 for sales of over 500,000 copies and [[Music recording certification|Platinum]] in 1996 for sales of over 1,000,000 copies.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{Cite certification |region=United States|certyear=2014|type=album|artist=Judy Collins}}</ref>\n\nIn 2017, Collins's rendition of the song \"[[Amazing Grace (song)|Amazing Grace]]\" was selected for preservation in the [[National Recording Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref name=\"Library of Congress\">{{cite web | url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-17-029/ | title=National Recording Registry Picks Are \"Over the Rainbow\" | work=Library of Congress | date=March 29, 2016 | access-date=March 29, 2016}}</ref> That same year, she received a Grammy Award nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Folk Album|Best Folk Album]] for ''[[Silver Skies Blue]]'' with [[Ari Hest]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2017/music/features/singer-judy-collins-grammy-nomination-1201979543/ |title=Judy Collins Talks Her First Grammy Nomination in 40 Years: 'I've Been Working All This Time |work=Variety.com |date=February 8, 2017 |access-date=October 27, 2017}}</ref> In 2019 at the age of 80, she scored her first No. 1 album on an American ''Billboard'' Chart with ''[[Winter Stories (album)|Winter Stories]]'', a duet album with Norwegian singer, songwriter, and guitarist [[Jonas Fjeld]] featuring [[Chatham County Line]].<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/chart-beat/8546731/judy-collins-first-career-billboard-number-one-winter-stories/item/prn-17-029/ | title= Judy Scores First Career Number 1 | magazine= Billboard | date=June 13, 2020 | access-date=March 29, 2016}}</ref> In 2022, she released her first studio album of all original material, titled ''[[Spellbound (Judy Collins album)|Spellbound]]'', and it earned her another Grammy nomination for Best Folk Album.\n\n==Early life==\nCollins was born the eldest of five siblings in [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]] where she lived for the first ten years of her life.

Years later, after she became known internationally, she invited Brico to one of her concerts in Denver. When they met after the performance, Brico took both of Collins' hands into hers, looked wistfully at her fingers and said, \"Little Judy—you really could have gone places.\" Still later, she discovered that Brico herself had made a living when she was younger playing [[jazz]] and [[ragtime]] piano (''Singing Lessons'', pp.&nbsp;71–72).

Three years after her debut as a piano [[Child prodigy|prodigy]], she was playing guitar. Her first public appearances as a folk artist after her graduation from Denver's East High School were at Michael's Pub in [[Boulder, Colorado]] and the folk club Exodus in Denver. Her music became popular at the [[University of Connecticut]], where her husband taught. She performed at parties and for the campus radio station along with [[David Grisman]] and Tom Azarian.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,526497,00.html|title=Time \"Striking a Chord\"|website=Time.com|access-date=August 20, 2021|archive-date=March 19, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200319133053/https://time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,526497,00.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===1960s===\nCollins eventually made her way to [[Greenwich Village]], [[New York City]] where she played in clubs like Gerde's Folk City until she signed with [[Elektra Records]], a label she was associated with for 35 years.

She was also instrumental in bringing little-known musicians to a wider public. For example, she recorded songs by Canadian poet [[Leonard Cohen]], who became a close friend over the years. She also recorded songs by singer-songwriters such as [[Eric Andersen]], [[Fred Neil]], [[Ian Tyson]], [[Joni Mitchell]], [[Randy Newman]], [[Robin Williamson]], and [[Richard Fariña]] long before they gained national acclaim.<ref>{{cite book|last=Simmons|first=Sylvie|title=I'm Your Man: The Life of Leonard Cohen|year=2012|publisher=McClelland & Stewart|isbn=978-0771080401}}</ref><ref name=newman>{{cite book|last=Courrier|first=Kevin|author-link=Kevin Courrier|title=Randy Newman: American Dreams|year=2005|publisher=ECW Press|isbn=978-1550226904|pages=65–66}}</ref>\n\n[[File:JodyCollins-Oct1965.jpg|thumb|right|Judy Collins in 1965]]\nCollins' first few studio albums consisted of straightforward guitar-based folk songs, but with her fifth studio album ''[[In My Life (Judy Collins album)|In My Life]]'' (1966), she began branching out to include works from such diverse sources as [[the Beatles]], [[Leonard Cohen]], [[Jacques Brel]], and [[Kurt Weill]].<ref name=newman/> [[Mark Abramson]] produced and [[Joshua Rifkin]] arranged the album, adding lush [[orchestration]] to many of the numbers.

(She was the inspiration for Stills's CSN classic \"[[Suite: Judy Blue Eyes]]\".) ''Time Goes'' had a mellow [[country music|country]] sound and included [[Ian Tyson]]'s \"[[Someday Soon (Ian Tyson song)|Someday Soon]]\" and the title track, written by the UK singer-songwriter [[Sandy Denny]].

She was also known for her broad range of material: her songs from this period include the traditional Christian [[hymn]] \"[[Amazing Grace]]\", the [[Stephen Sondheim]] [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] [[ballad]] \"[[Send in the Clowns]]\" (both of which were top 20 hits as singles in both the U.S. and the U.K.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.officialcharts.com/artist/13893/judy-collins/|title=JUDY COLLINS|publisher=[[The Official UK Charts Company]]|access-date=December 17, 2021}}</ref>), a recording of [[Joan Baez]]'s \"[[One Day at a Time (Joan Baez album)|A Song for David]]\", and her own compositions, such as \"Born to the Breed\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Santosuosso|first=Ernie|title=Judy Collins' flight of fancy|newspaper=Boston Globe|date=May 11, 1975}}</ref>\n\nIn 1971, Collins issued her second live album, ''[[Living (Judy Collins album)|Living]]'', and the compilation album ''[[Colors of the Day: The Best of Judy Collins]]'' followed a year later. Collins' ninth studio album ''[[True Stories and Other Dreams]]'' (1973) found her in a contemplative mood, featuring an original song about a friend who took his own life (\"Song for Martin\") and another about the life of Argentine [[Marxism|Marxist]] revolutionary [[Che Guevara]] (\"Che\"). For her tenth studio album ''[[Judith (album)|Judith]]'' (1975), she collaborated with producer [[Arif Mardin]], who gave the album a sophisticated sound. ''Judith'' produced her biggest hit single with her mournful version of Stephen Sondheim's \"[[Send in the Clowns]]\", and it would become her best-selling record, eventually going platinum.\n\nAs Collins stepped up to a higher level of stardom, the longtime activist put political themes at the forefront of her eleventh studio album  ''[[Bread and Roses (album)|Bread and Roses]]'' (1976). Political statements like the title song, originally a poem by [[James Oppenheim]] commonly associated with a 1912 [[1912 Lawrence textile strike|garment workers strike]] in [[Lawrence, Massachusetts]], were balanced with such pop compositions as [[Elton John]]'s \"Come Down in Time\", but the album failed to achieve the commercial success of ''Judith''. Following the release of the album, Collins underwent treatment for damaged vocal cords, and after years of struggling with alcoholism, she sought medical help to give up drinking. Her compilation album ''[[So Early in the Spring (Judy Collins album)|So Early in the Spring... The First 15 Years]]'' (1977) sold modestly.\n\n[[File:Zangeres Judy Collins in Hiltonhotel Amsterdam, Judy Collins, Bestanddeelnr 925-1517.jpg|thumb|right| Collins in Hilton Amsterdam, a hotel, in 1971]]\nCollins guest starred on ''[[The Muppet Show]]'' in an episode broadcast in January 1978,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Garlen|first1=Jennifer C.|last2=Graham|first2=Anissa M.|title=Kermit Culture: Critical Perspectives on Jim Henson's Muppets|year=2009|publisher=McFarland & Company|isbn=978-0786442591|page=[https://archive.org/details/kermitculturecri0000unse/page/218 218]|url=https://archive.org/details/kermitculturecri0000unse/page/218}}</ref> singing \"[[Leather-Winged Bat]]\", \"[[There Was an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly]]\", \"[[Do-Re-Mi]]\", and \"Send in the Clowns\". She also appeared several times on ''[[Sesame Street]]'', where she performed \"Fishermen's Song\" with a chorus of [[Anything Muppet]] fishermen, sang a trio with [[Biff and Sully]] using the word \"yes\", and even starred in a modern musical fairy tale skit called \"The Sad Princess\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Ann|first=Lolordo|title=Judy Collins changing styles|newspaper=Lodi News-Sentinel|date=August 13, 1977}}</ref> In 1979, she returned to music with her twelfth studio album ''[[Hard Times for Lovers]]'', a pop-oriented album in the same vein as ''Judith''; she gained some extra publicity with the cover sleeve photograph of her in the nude.\n\n===1980s===\n''[[Running for My Life]]'' (1980) and ''[[Times of Our Lives (Judy Collins album)|Times of Our Lives]]'' (1982) were well-crafted exercises in adult pop and soft rock, but as tastes changed, Collins' sales were on the decline. ''[[Home Again (Judy Collins album)|Home Again]]'' (1984) found her exploring some new musical avenues, including a synth-based cover of [[Yazoo (band)|Yaz's]] \"Only You\" and a duet with country star [[T. G. Sheppard]] on the title cut. While the \"Home Again\" single was a minor hit, the album was not, and after 23 years, Collins and [[Elektra Records|Elektra]] parted ways. She performed the music for the 1983 animated television special ''[[The Magic of Herself the Elf]]'', as well as the theme song of the [[Rankin/Bass Animated Entertainment|Rankin/Bass Productions]] television film ''[[The Wind in the Willows (1987 film)|The Wind in the Willows]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Woolery|first=George W.|title=Animated TV Specials|year=1989|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0810821989|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/animatedtvspecia0000wool}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Judy Collins.jpg|thumb|Collins at a book signing, 1995|left]]\nCollins traveled to England in 1985 and struck a one-off deal with Telstar Records to record the studio album ''[[Amazing Grace (Judy Collins album)|Amazing Grace]]'', in which she re-recorded several of her better-known songs with an inspirational bent.
