In 1958 he returned to Ireland. Still working as a carpenter, he soon joined the part-time [[Gowna]]-based Grafton Showband, but left it in 1961 to become fully professional as the lead singer of the Mighty Avons, based in [[Cavan]]. That band initially specialised in covers of [[Jim Reeves]] songs and similar country material.\n\nThe band's first taste of fame came when they were supporting Jim Reeves during the Irish leg of his European tour in 1963; when Reeves walked off the stage during a concert in [[Lifford]] in protest at the poor condition of the supplied [[piano]], the Avons (as they later became popularly called) took over and entertained the crowd, to much subsequent publicity and acclaim.<ref name=larrybio /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://iangallagher.com/mightyavons.html|title=The Mighty Avons|first=Ian|last=Gallagher|access-date=21 August 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.roscommonpeople.ie/itemdetail.asp?itemID=12742&menu=d12742 |title=Larry Cunningham in Rooskey |newspaper=Roscommon People |access-date=22 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005165838/http://www.roscommonpeople.ie/itemdetail.asp?itemID=12742&menu=d12742 |archive-date=5 October 2011 }}</ref>\n\nIn December 1964, Cunningham and the Mighty Avons had a [[Irish Singles Chart|Top-10 hit]] with the song \"Tribute to Jim Reeves\", which also entered the British charts<ref>{{cite news|title=Larry Cunningham to appear on Nationwide|newspaper=Longford Leader|date=18 March 2010}}</ref> (the first time for an Irish artiste),<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/unsorted/features/50-years-on-why-the-charts-still-no-1-293700.html|title=50 years on - why the chart's still No 1|newspaper=[[Irish Independent]]|first=Shay|last=Healy|author-link=Shay Healy|date=21 September 2002|access-date=24 August 2011}}</ref> and played on ''[[Top of the Pops]]''<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/unsorted/features/hats-off-to-top-of-the-popsand-those-great-green-years-205401.html|title=Hats off to Top Of The Pops...and those great green years|newspaper=[[Irish Independent]]|date=18 September 2003|access-date=24 August 2011}}</ref> (also an Irish first), which further boosted their career. Their major hit was \"Lovely [[County Leitrim|Leitrim]]\" in September 1965, which stayed at number one in the charts for four weeks. As well as regularly touring Ireland to large crowds, the Avons made many appearances on television, and often played in Britain, the US, and other places.\n\nIn late 1969, he left the Mighty Avons and merged with [[Edenderry]] band The Fairways to form Larry Cunningham and the Country Blue Boys, leaving [[Gene Stuart]] to front the Avons.<ref name=irishshowbands>{{cite web|url=http://www.irish-showbands.com/Bands/larryc.htm|title=Larry Cunningham Feature|publisher=irish-showbands.com|access-date=21 August 2011}}</ref> Cunningham continued having success with his new band, but after his marriage in 1972 he gave up regular touring in favour of occasional concerts and recording. He continued to have top-10 hits until the mid-1970s, and still performed occasionally for the remainder of his life. In recent years, audio and video compilations of his music have been released, as well as a biography.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.longfordleader.ie/news/local/a_lifetime_of_music_recalled_in_new_book_1_1955768 |title=A lifetime of music recalled in new book |newspaper=Longford Leader |date=25 August 2009 |access-date=24 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003084537/http://www.longfordleader.ie/news/local/a_lifetime_of_music_recalled_in_new_book_1_1955768 |archive-date=3 October 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.mentorbooks.ie/book.aspx?contentid=218|title=LarryCunningham: A Showband Legend|last=Gilmore|first=Tom|publisher=Mentor Books|year=2009|isbn=978-1-906623-39-5}}</ref>\n\nIn February 1972, Cunningham married Beatrice Nannery, who worked for him managing a supermarket which he owned.
